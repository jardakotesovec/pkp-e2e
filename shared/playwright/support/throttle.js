/**
 * @file lib/pkp/playwright/support/throttle.js
 *
 * Opt-in race amplifier for flake hunting: `PLAYWRIGHT_CPU_THROTTLE=<rate>`
 * slows every page's main thread by that factor through the DevTools
 * protocol (Chromium only), so the timing windows a slow CI runner or the
 * 4-core VM opens reproduce on a fast machine. Off unless the variable is
 * set to a number above 1; never set in CI or a final.
 *
 * `PLAYWRIGHT_RAF_HOLD_MS=<ms>` is the second lever: every
 * `requestAnimationFrame` callback of every page is deferred by that many
 * milliseconds, which holds open the windows that end "a frame or two after
 * the click" (headlessui hands the focus to an opened menu two frames
 * later: the U30 S4 race, `.reports/flake-s26/u30/diagnosis.md`). CPU
 * throttling does not open those windows, since it slows the test's own
 * in-page reads as much as the frames. Off unless set; never in CI.
