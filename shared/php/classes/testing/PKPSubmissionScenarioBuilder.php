 * @class PKPSubmissionScenarioBuilder
 *
 * @brief POST /api/v1/_test/scenarios/submission — walk a submission to a
 * declared end-state through the SAME services the wizard and workflow
 * screens use (PRINCIPLES D3): Repo::submission()->add()/submit() (real
 * SubmissionSubmitted event → stage-1 discussion, AssignEditors, tasks),
 * Repo::decision()->add() (real DecisionType::runAdditionalActions — a
 * sendExternalReview decision creates review round 1 itself),
 * EditorAction::addReviewer and ReviewerAction::confirmReview for reviewer
 * states. Tests never script the journey to their starting point.
 *
 * Step-2 core schema: tag*, context* (urlPath), submitter* (username), title,
 * abstract, locale, submitted (explicit false = wizard-resumable draft),
 * decisions[] (real decision names, app-resolved), reviewRounds[] with
 * reviewers[] {username, status: invited|accepted|declined|completed,
 * reviewForm, recommendation, comments, dateCompleted}, published.
 * Overlays: OJS section/issue; OMP series/seriesPosition + per-round stage
 * internal|external; OPS section (reviewRounds REJECTED — no review stage).
 * Richer keys return per feature, each with a parity entry.
 *
 * Feature passthroughs so far (each with a parity-ledger entry):
 * - reviewers[].status 'completed' (+ 'recommendation', 'comments') — U30:
 *   the reviewer wizard's own step forms run under the reviewer's identity
 *   (PKPReviewerReviewStep1Form → Step2Form → Step3Form::execute), so the
 *   assignment, the submission comment, the editors' REVIEWER_COMMENT
 *   notifications + REVIEW_COMPLETE email-log rows, the task deletion and
 *   the reviewReady event-log row are the app's own. 'accepted' keeps the
 *   bare confirmReview (step stays 1 — a documented deviation the U28
 *   suites walk from).
 * - participants[] {username*, role*, recommendOnly?, canChangeMetadata?} —
 *   non-submitter stage assignments (U21: an assigned Section Editor opening
 *   another author's draft), the same Repo::stageAssignment()->build() row
 *   the workflow's Assign Participant form writes. recommendOnly and
 *   canChangeMetadata (U35) are that window's "Assignment privileges" and
 *   "Permissions" boxes, defaulting to the user group's own recommendOnly /
 *   permitMetadataEdit as the window pre-ticks them; recommendOnly is
 *   refused on a role below sub-editor level and canChangeMetadata false on
 *   a manager-level role, as the window offers neither. The assignment
 *   email and notification the UI flow sends are deliberately absent
 *   (seed-side, Mail::fake anyway).
 * - author {orcid*, orcidIsVerified?} — ORCID iD fixture state on the
 *   submitter's contributor record (U4): a connected iD is only reachable
 *   through ORCID's own OAuth sign-in, which can never complete in the test
 *   env (outbound HTTP fails fast at the dead-port `[proxy]` in
 *   config.test.inc.php, and the sandbox ORCID credentials are dummies), so
 *   the unauthenticated/verified field states are seeded directly: the same
 *   author_settings rows the emailed link's landing stores
 *   (VerifyIdentityWithOrcid::setIdentityData), a verified iD carrying the
 *   live access token, scope, refresh token and expiry too
 *   (UserSeeder::orcidOAuthData; parity ledger 2026-09-13).
 * - reviewRounds[].reviewers[].reviewForm "<title>" — attaches the context's
 *   ACTIVE review form of that exact title to the assignment (U28), the
 *   same Repo::reviewAssignment()->edit(['reviewFormId']) the reviewer
 *   row's "Edit" window runs (EditReviewForm::execute; the window offers
 *   active forms only). A missing or inactive title is a 400 naming the
 *   active titles.
 * - reviewerSuggestions[] {givenName*, familyName?, email*, affiliation?,
 *   suggestionReason?} — the wizard's "Reviewer Suggestions" step entries
 *   (U31): the same ReviewerSuggestion::create() the step's "Add Reviewer
 *   Suggestion" window runs through POST submissions/{id}/reviewers/
 *   suggestions (ReviewerSuggestionController::add), validated with that
 *   request's own rules (AddReviewerSuggestion::rules + the multilingual
 *   rule) and created before submit(), as the wizard adds them (the API
 *   refuses add/edit/delete on a complete submission). The step exists
 *   only while the context's reviewerSuggestionEnabled is on, so a seed on
 *   a context with it off is a 400; OPS (no API mount, no step) refuses
 *   the key.
 * - userComments[] {user*, text*, approved? (default false), reports[]
 *   {user*, note*}} — reader comments on the published publication and
 *   their reports (U14): the same UserComment::query()->create() the
 *   comments API's POST runs (UserCommentController::submit), the same
 *   Repo::userComment()->addReport() its POST {id}/reports runs, and the
 *   controller's own notifyModerators() fan-out after each (one
 *   NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_TASK row per manager and site admin of the context:
 *   USER_COMMENT_POSTED on the comment, USER_COMMENT_REPORTED on the
 *   report), invoked on the controller by reflection so the moderator
 *   roster and the notification rows are the app's own, never mirrored.
 *   `approved: true` is the moderator's PUT {id}/setApproval written the
 *   way that action writes it (isApproved, approvedAt now, approvedByUserId
 *   the acting moderator — the seeding admin, a manager of every scratch
 *   context). The key needs `published: true` (the comment box exists on a
 *   published landing page only and the API refuses a publication that is
 *   not the current one); a report needs an approved comment (only the
 *   writer sees a pending or hidden one, so the "…" menu offers "Report"
 *   on approved comments alone) and a reporter other than the writer
 *   (one's own comment offers no "Report"). Text and note go through the
 *   form requests' PKPString::stripUnsafeHtml, as posted text does.
 * - galleys[] {label*, locale?, file | urlRemote} — galleys on the
 *   submission's current publication (U33), OJS and OPS only (OMP has
 *   publication formats, so the key is a 400 there): the same
 *   Repo::galley()->add() the "Galleys" page's "Add galley" › "Create New
 *   Galley" window runs (ArticleGalleyForm / PreprintGalleyForm::execute),
 *   followed by the grid handler's own notice recompute (updateGalley:
 *   NotificationManager::updateNotification of the app's galley notice
 *   types on a submission at Copyediting or Production), then, for `file`,
 *   the upload wizard "Upload a File Ready for Publication" step for step:
 *   the file service's add() into the submission's directory, a new
 *   SubmissionFile at SUBMISSION_FILE_PROOF hung on the galley
 *   (ASSOC_TYPE_REPRESENTATION, the app's submission-file repository links
 *   galley.submissionFileId), and the "Review Details" step's save
 *   (SubmissionFilesMetadataForm::execute + PKPManageFileApiHandler::
 *   saveMetadata's author-notification update and MetadataChanged event).
 *   `file` is a basename under apps/<app>/playwright/fixtures/files/,
 *   which bin/mount.js copies to classes/testing/fixtures/ in the checkout;
 *   the genre is the first the wizard's list offers (the context's first
 *   non-dependent genre, "Article Text"). `urlRemote` seeds the window's
 *   "Remotely hosted content" galley with no file (the wizard cancelled).
 * - files[] {file*, genre?, uploader?, note?} and reviewRounds[].files[]
 *   {file*, genre?} — submission files (U36), OJS and OMP only (a preprint
 *   server shows no workflow file list, so OPS refuses both). A root entry
 *   is a file on the Submission stage's "Submission Files" list. Uploaded
 *   by the submitter (the default), it is the submission wizard's "Files"
 *   panel upload, before the submit and as the submitter: the step for step
 *   of POST submissions/{id}/files (PKPSubmissionFileController::add:
 *   the file service's add, Repo::submissionFile()->validate and ->add at
 *   SUBMISSION_FILE_SUBMISSION, the name the uploaded file's own) and the
 *   panel's component choice (PUT submissions/{id}/files/{fileId}
 *   {genreId}: validate, ->edit). Uploaded by anyone else (a manager, the
 *   site admin, or a sub-editor or assistant seeded in participants[]), it
 *   is the workflow's "Upload" on "Submission Files" after the submit,
 *   acting as that user: the upload wizard's step 1
 *   (SubmissionFilesUploadForm::execute) and step 2
 *   (PKPManageFileApiHandler::saveMetadata), as galleys[] runs them. `note`
 *   is the file's "More Information" › "Notes" › "Add Note", posted by the
 *   acting editor (admin): NewFileNoteForm::execute and the handler's own
 *   notePosted event-log row (FileInformationCenterHandler::_logEvent). A
 *   round entry is the "Files for Review" list's "Upload/Select Files" ›
 *   "Upload Review File", acting as the editor, into the round before its
 *   reviewers are added, then that window's "OK" with the uploaded rows
 *   ticked (ManageReviewFilesForm::execute, which marks them viewable),
 *   and every seeded reviewer of the round is granted the round's
 *   files the way the Add Reviewer form's file list (all ticked by
 *   default, LimitReviewFilesGridHandler::isDataElementSelected) grants
 *   them (ReviewerForm::execute → ReviewFilesDAO::grant). `file` is a
 *   fixture basename, as for galleys[]; `genre` the name of one of the
 *   components the upload lists offer (enabled, not dependent), default
 *   the first main-work one ("Article Text", "Book Manuscript").
 * - tasks[] {title*, creator*, participants*, type?, stage?, owner?,
 *   dateDue?, started?, message?} — discussions and tasks on a stage's
 *   "Tasks & Discussions" panel (U37), each the panel's "Add" › "Save" by
 *   its creator, after everything else: the window's JSON body through
 *   the AddTask request's own rules and EditorialTaskController::addTask
 *   itself (ApiCall), then, for a started task, ::startTask ("Begin Task
 *   Upon Saving"). A past dateDue (the window refuses one, A10) is the one
 *   lifted rule: it stands for a due date passed since the save.
 * - libraryFiles[] {name*, type*, description?, file?} — the submission's
 *   Submission Library (U39): each the workflow header's "Library" ›
 *   "Add a file" window, its upload and its "OK", acting as the editor
 *   (admin), after everything but tasks[] (LibraryFileSeeder:
 *   TemporaryFileManager::handleUpload, then the submissionDocuments
 *   NewLibraryFileForm's execute). `type` is a label of the window's
 *   "Type" list, `file` a fixture basename (default the app's PDF
 *   fixture); the window has no "Public Access" box, so that key is a
 *   400. A draft has no workflow, so the key needs submitted: true.
 * - citationsRaw (string, or a list of lines) — the wizard's "Details"
 *   step References box (U42; PKPCitationsForm's FieldTextarea, saved
 *   by the step's PUT submissions/{id}/publications/{id} with the rest of
 *   the step): the same Repo::publication()->edit() that PUT runs
 *   (PKPSubmissionController::editPublication), whose DAO update rebuilds
 *   the version's citation rows from the text (Repo::citation()->
 *   importCitations: one row per line, trimmed, doubled spaces shrunk,
 *   blank lines skipped, and with the context's citationsMetadataLookup
 *   on the lookup job chain queued per row), before the submit and as the
 *   submitter. A list is joined with newlines, one line per entry.
 * - dataCitations[] {title*, relationshipType*, identifierType?,
 *   identifier?, repository?, year?, authors? [{givenName?, familyName?,
 *   orcid?}], url?} — the Data Citations table's "Add Data Citation" ›
 *   "Save" (U42; DataCitationEditForm), in the wizard's "Data" section or
 *   on the workflow's "Data" page alike: the panel's body through
 *   PKPDataCitationController::add itself (ApiCall: convertStringsToSchema,
 *   Repo::dataCitation()->validate, DataCitation::create, whose saving hook
 *   strips an identifier to its bare form), before the submit and in list
 *   order. The panel posts every box, an empty one as null; its refusals
 *   (a missing title or relationship type, a value outside the schema's
 *   lists, an identifier invalid for its type, a year not four digits, a
 *   bad address) are the seed's 400s.
 * - mediaFiles[] {file*, genre?, resolution?, name?, pair?} — the current
 *   publication's "Media" page (U47), all three apps, acting as the editor
 *   (admin), after the galleys and before a publish: each card's
 *   temporaryFiles upload, one "Upload Files" (MediaFilesController::add),
 *   "Edit Metadata" › "Save" per `name` (::edit) and, with any `pair`, one
 *   "Batch Link Media" › "Link Media" (::linkMany), each through the
 *   action's own form request (ApiCall). `genre` a dependent component the
 *   window lists (default "Image"), `resolution` web | high_resolution
 *   (the latter for a "File Variants" component only), `pair` a label two
 *   entries share, one of each resolution, of one component. A draft
 *   refuses the key.
 * - publicationFormats[] {name*, file?} — OMP only (a journal and a
 *   preprint server have galleys, so the key is a 400 there; galleys[] is
 *   their counterpart): a publication format on the current publication,
 *   ready for readers, as the "Publication Formats" page builds one
 *   (U47). The OMP overlay (APP\testing\SubmissionScenarioBuilder) owns
 *   it; this core refuses the key and runs the overlay's two steps: the
 *   format with its file before a publish, and its availability after.
 * - subtitle, plainLanguageSummary, keywords / subjects / disciplines /
 *   supportingAgencies, coverImage {file*, altText?}, categories (paths),
 *   urlPath, OJS articleNumber — the version's own display values (U13),
 *   typed on the workflow's publication pages by the editor after the
 *   submit and before any publish: "Title & Abstract", "Metadata" and
 *   "Publication Settings" (OPS "Preprint entry"), each a PUT
 *   submissions/{id}/publications/{id}. The seed saves each page whose
 *   fields it sets, in the shape that page posts them, through
 *   PKPSubmissionController::editPublication itself (ApiCall:
 *   convertStringsToSchema, Repo::publication()->validate — the URL Path
 *   rules among them — then ->edit, which moves the cover image's
 *   temporary file into the context's public files, and the
 *   MetadataChanged event), acting as the editor (admin), whose cover
 *   upload is the image box's POST temporaryFiles (handleUpload). The keys
 *   do not read the context's Metadata items or its "Article Number"
 *   setting, as the landing pages do not. OMP takes `categories` (U16)
 *   and `datePublished` (U17) alone, saved as the press's "Catalog Entry"
 *   page saves them (the same PUT, its "Categories" and "Date Published"
 *   fields), and refuses the rest (not parity-checked there).
 * - datePublished "YYYY-MM-DD" (U17) — the date box of the same page
 *   (OJS "Publication Date" on "Publication Settings", OPS "Date Posted"
 *   on "Preprint entry", OMP "Date Published" on "Catalog Entry"), saved
 *   in that page's PUT with its other fields. A later publish keeps it:
 *   each app's Repository::setStatusOnPublish stamps today only on an
 *   empty date, and on OMP and OPS a date after today schedules the
 *   version instead of publishing it.
 * - galleys[].urlPath and galleys[].genre (U13): the "Create New Galley"
 *   window's "URL Path" (ArticleGalleyForm / PreprintGalleyForm's own
 *   checks: the pattern, not a number, not a URL Path another galley of
 *   the version has) and the upload wizard's component, one of those its
 *   list offers (enabled, not dependent, so "Image" is refused). Neither
 *   exists for a remotely hosted galley, whose window hides "URL Path" and
 *   opens no wizard.
 * - jats {file?, makePublic?} — OJS only (the JATS API and the "JATS XML"
 *   publication page exist on a journal alone, so the key is a 400 on a
 *   press and a preprint server): the current publication's "JATS XML"
 *   page (U48), acting as the editor (admin), after the media files and
 *   before a publish. The OJS overlay (APP\testing\SubmissionScenarioBuilder)
 *   owns it; this core refuses the key and runs the overlay's step.
 *
 * The workflow start stage comes from each app's submission schema default —
 * never hard-coded here (a hard-coded initial stage once made every seeded
 * OPS submission invisible; PRINCIPLES D5).
