 * @class JobScenarioBuilder
 *
 * @brief POST /api/v1/_test/scenarios/job — one job of the test's own on
 * Administration's Jobs or Failed Jobs page (U61). The job is lib/pkp's own
 * queue smoke-test job, PKP\jobs\testJobs\TestJobFailure, on its own queue
 * (Job::TESTING_QUEUE, "queuedTestJob"), which the ordinary drain (`jobs.php
 * run`, support/jobs.js runJobs) never runs, and whose handle() always throws
 * on its one try. The two states are the two steps of the app's own smoke
 * test, `php lib/pkp/tools/jobs.php test --only=failed` then `jobs.php run
 * --test`:
 *
 * - state 'queued' — dispatch() it, as `jobs.php test --only=failed` does: a
 *   `jobs` row, Attempts 0, listed on the Jobs page.
 * - state 'failed' — dispatch it, then run that one job through the app's
 *   queue worker as `jobs.php run --test` does (PKPQueueProvider::
 *   runJobInQueue → Worker::runNextJob → Worker::process): the job is
 *   reserved (DatabaseQueue::marshalJob, the step pop() takes), fired, and
 *   failed for good by the worker, and PKPQueueProvider's Queue::failing
 *   listener stores the `failed_jobs` row the Failed Jobs page lists.
 *
 * One deliberate deviation (parity ledger): the CLI pops the queue's OLDEST
 * job, and the testing queue may already hold another test's job (a
 * `queued` seed, or a failed job put back by "Try Again" or "Requeue All
 * Failed Jobs"), so the builder reserves its own job by id instead. The
 * reserve, the run and the failure are the app's own.
 *
 * App-neutral: the queue and its tools are lib/pkp's alone. Not run inside
 * the builder transaction: the database queue is configured `after_commit`,
 * so a job dispatched inside a transaction is not inserted until it commits.
