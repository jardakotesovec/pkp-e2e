 *
 * JATS & Body Text — OMP suite. A press does not install this feature (the
 * spec's title badge is {OJS}), so the press runs the one scenario written
 * for it, S9 "No 'JATS XML' and no 'Body Text'" {OMP OPS}: the absence test
 * with a positive control per assertion (RUNBOOK multi-app rule 3), in the
 * press's own words: the Press Manager, a published monograph, the book's
 * page. S1–S8 are the journal's, in its tree.
 * Spec: docs/specs/U48-jats-and-body-text.md
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered (register IDs from the spec's Findings register;
 * a 🐞 is never asserted as the contract, a ❓ is parked, not a gap; the
 * spec's Coverage section is the record of everything else left out):
 * - OMP1: the press's file lists offering "Send to Text Editor" with no
 *   "Body Text" page to send to (🐞).
 * - A1–A19: all on the journal's "JATS XML" and "Body Text" pages or the
 *   article's page, which a press does not have.
 *
 * Seeding: scenario endpoints only; publicknowledge and the seeded roster
 * are read-only. The monograph is a scratch submission of the seeded press,
 * submitted by the seeded Author with a unique tag (M5), taken to
 * Production and published, as footnote v says.
 *
 * The absence on the workflow is read on a settled side menu: the version's
 * pages are read once the version node has unfolded to its first page, and
 * each missing entry is paired with the "Title & Abstract" entry of the same
 * list, read the same way, whose page then opens (M4, M6). The absence on
 * the book's page is read once the page's own title heading is shown (a
 * server-rendered page, complete at that point), the link queried by role
 * like the heading it is paired with. Waits are web-first (A5). Runs in the
 * parallel `omp` project: nothing here changes the press.
