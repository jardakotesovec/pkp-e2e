 * @file playwright/tests/U05-notifications-center-and-email-preferences.spec.js
 *
 * Notifications center & email preferences — OMP suite, one test per
 * canonical scenario the spec runs on a press (scenarios 1–8, 10 and 11,
 * read with the spec's press vocabulary: press, Press Manager, "A new
 * monograph has been submitted to which an editor needs to be assigned.",
 * "New announcement.", "Desk Review Tasks & Discussions"). Scenario 9 is
 * OJS-only (a press has no issues and no issue row): the spec's absence
 * sentence is asserted where S7 reads the press's exact row list, and this
 * suite has no serial half.
 * Spec: docs/specs/U05-notifications-center-and-email-preferences.md
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered (register IDs from the spec's Findings register —
 * a 🐞 is never asserted as the contract, a ❓ is parked, not a gap): A1 🐞,
 * A2 🐞, A3 🐞, A10 🐞, A4 ❓, A5 ❓, A6 ❓, A7 ❓, A8 ❓, A9 ❓, A11 ❓; the
 * OPS-only OPS1, OPS2 and OPS3 do not arise on a press. Where a test passes
 * through one it asserts the effect the spec states and leaves the
 * finding's own claim unasserted either way: S3 reads Manager B's email as
 * the control and never Manager A's mailbox (A10); S5 and S6 unsubscribe
 * accounts whose tab is at its defaults (A2); the "needs an editor" email
 * is asserted by subject only, its footer neither asserted nor denied
 * (A8); no reader-side count is read for a Series Editor (A3); the
 * site-level tab is read and never saved (A4). S11 asserts the
 * review-complete subject's shape with the recommendation word read
 * loosely, because *Reviewer's review*'s register (U28 OMP2 🐞) describes
 * the press's "recommends None" and PRINCIPLES M3 forbids freezing it.
 * The spec's Coverage section records everything else left out.
 *
 * Isolation: every test seeds its own scratch press with throwaway accounts
 * through the scenario endpoint (unique tags naming the app, at most 13
 * characters, so no password reaches the Register page's 32-character cap);
 * `publicknowledge` and the roster are only read (S7). Where the scenario
 * needs the "needs an editor" EMAIL, the Author submits through the wizard
 * from a seeded draft (a seeded `submitted: true` submission raises the task
 * but sends no email, seed-facts; the press wizard asks no abstract); where
 * only the task is needed, the seed suffices. Mailpit reads are scoped by
 * the throwaway recipient (PRINCIPLES A8) and every silence claim rides on a
 * positive control. The bell's number is asserted on a freshly loaded page
 * or after the window closed, never on the page that was open when the task
 * was raised (Rule 2a). Every sign-in that a scenario ends (S6's sign-out
 * in another tab) or that a signed-out page leads to (S5's "user profile")
 * happens in the test's own fresh browser context through the real Login
 * form, never through the shared .auth cache. S5 and S6 save a discussion
 * from the workflow page, which on a press works only with the campaign's
 * overlay class mounted (docs/tracking/app-changes.md row 12; `npm run
 * mount`, CI mounts it too); leaving the workflow page afterwards raises
 * the browser's leave-page prompt, so both tests answer it. S7's admin
 * reads (the site-level window's rows, the site home's "Dashboard" number)
 * are re-read together when a parallel worker's seed lands between two
 * reads, because `admin` is a Press Manager of every scratch press. No
 * hard-coded waits: S3's "stays while the pointer rests on it" is bounded
 * by a third toast's own disappearance.
