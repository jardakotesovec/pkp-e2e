## Summary

A manager offers someone a role with "Invite to a role" on Users &
Roles. For each role, the wizard asks whether the person will "Appear
on the masthead"; nothing is preselected. When the manager picks
"Appear on the masthead", the invitation email says "Your name will
appear in the {journal}'s masthead as a {role}." It says this even for
roles the journal's "Editorial Masthead" page does not list, such as
Author, Reader or Copyeditor. The page itself stays correct, and the
invitation works.

The inviter cannot remove the sentence on its own: the role lines are
filled in when the email is sent. Once the person accepts, the
"Appear" choice is stored with the role. Every later invitation to them
repeats the promise under "Already assigned roles", until a manager sets
that role to "Does not appear on the masthead" on the person's "Edit"
page.

This happens on a default install, where the masthead lists only the
editor roles and "Editorial Board Member" (on a preprint server,
"Moderator" and "Editorial Board Member"). If the journal later ticks
"Consider role in masthead list" for such a role, the people stored as
"Appear" are listed, and the sentence becomes true. Reviewer rows are a
separate case and outside this report.

## Impact

- **Lost**: nothing. The person is promised a public listing that they
  do not get, and nothing tells them otherwise.
- **Who**: people invited to a role the masthead does not list, when
  the manager picks "Appear on the masthead" for it, one of the two
  answers the wizard requires for every role.
- **Way round**: the manager picks "Does not appear on the masthead" for
  such a role, and the email then says "Your name will not appear …".
  For someone already told, a manager can open Users & Roles, choose
  "Edit" on that person's row and set the role to "Does not appear on
  the masthead". Later invitations then read correctly. Nothing on
  screen says that either step is needed.

Low: wrong wording in an email. The invitation, the stored choice and
the public page are all right.

## Steps to reproduce

Preconditions:

- PKP's default test dataset for `main` (OJS; OMP and OPS the same, with
  the differences in brackets). David Buskins (`dbuskins`) is a "Section
  editor" ["Series editor" on OMP, "Moderator" on OPS] who appears on
  the masthead. He holds no Author or Reader role.

1. As a visitor, open About › "Editorial Masthead"
   (`/index.php/publicknowledge/about/editorialMasthead`).
2. Sign in as `rvaca` and open Settings › Users & Roles. Press "Invite to
   a role".
3. Type `dbuskins@mailinator.com` under "Search for a user by email
   address" and press "Search User". His "Section editor" row reads
   "Appear on the masthead" under "Journal Masthead" ["Press Masthead",
   "Server Masthead"].
4. In the new row, pick "Author" under "Select a new role", today's date
   as the start date, and "Appear on the masthead". Press "Save And
   Continue", then "Invite user to the role".
5. Read the email "You are invited to new roles" sent to
   `dbuskins@mailinator.com`.
6. Sign out. Open the email's "Accept Invitation" link and press "Accept
   And Continue to OJS".
7. As a visitor, reload About › "Editorial Masthead".
8. Sign in as `rvaca` again. Invite `dbuskins@mailinator.com` the same
   way, this time offering "Reader" with "Appear on the masthead".
9. Read the second "You are invited to new roles" email.

**Expected**: the email promises a masthead listing only for a role the
masthead lists. "Section editor" gets "Your name will appear …".
"Author" and "Reader", which the masthead does not list, get no such
promise.

**Observed**: step 1's page has the headings "Journal editor" and
"Section editor" only ["Press editor", "Series editor"; OPS
"Moderator"], with David Buskins under "Section editor". Step 5's email
reads:

```
Already assigned roles
1. Section editor
Starting from 2026-10-01
Your name will appear in the Journal of Public Knowledge's masthead as a Section editor.
Newly assigned roles
1. Author
Starting from 2026-10-02
Your name will appear in the Journal of Public Knowledge's masthead as a Author.
```

Step 7's page is unchanged: the same two headings, with no "Author"
heading. Step 9's email repeats the promise for the role he now holds
and for the one offered:

```
Already assigned roles
1. Section editor … Your name will appear in the Journal of Public Knowledge's masthead as a Section editor.
2. Author … Your name will appear in the Journal of Public Knowledge's masthead as a Author.
Newly assigned roles
1. Reader … Your name will appear in the Journal of Public Knowledge's masthead as a Reader.
```


## Cause

`UserRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify::getUserUserGroupSection()` (pkp-lib,
`classes/mail/mailables/UserRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify.php`) chooses
the sentence from the member's own choice for the role, and nothing else:

```php
if (isset($userUserGroup->masthead) && $userUserGroup->masthead) {
    $sectionMastheadAppear = __('emails.userRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify.userGroupSectionWillAppear', …);
}
```

For every role except Reviewer, the masthead lists a member only when
two things are true. First, the role's "Consider role in masthead list"
box must be ticked on the role's Edit form; this is the role's `masthead`
attribute. Second, the member's choice for that role
(`user_user_groups.masthead`) must be "Appear".
`AboutContextHandler::editorialMasthead()` takes its roles from
`Repo::userGroup()->getSortedMastheadUserGroups()` (`masthead(true)`,
reviewers excluded). It then takes their members from
`getMastheadUserIdsByRoleIds()`, which keeps those whose choice is
"Appear". `Repo::userGroup()->userOnMasthead()` makes the same two
checks. The mailable makes only the second.

`registry/userGroups.xml` sets `masthead="true"` on these roles:

- OJS and OMP: the editor, section editor, external reviewer and
  "Editorial Board Member" roles;
- OPS: Moderator and "Editorial Board Member".

The wizard has no preselected answer (`masthead: null` in
`UserInvitationUserGroupsTable.vue`). The server requires an answer for
every row (`userGroupsToAdd.*.masthead` is `required|bool` in
`UserRoleAssignmentInvitePayload`). The same method writes both the
"Newly assigned roles" and the "Already assigned roles" sections.
`UserRoleAssignmentReceiveController::finalize()` stores the member's
choice on acceptance, so later invitations repeat it. Storing the choice
is right: it is the member's answer, which the masthead uses once the
role's box is ticked.

The compose step builds its email from an empty stand-in invitation
(`SendInvitationStep::getFakeInvitation()`). Its text carries the
`{$existingRoles}` and `{$rolesAdded}` variables, which are filled in
when the email is sent. So the inviter can delete the whole roles list,
but not the one sentence.

**Reviewers are out of scope here.** The masthead lists reviewers in a
different way. `editorialMasthead()` lists external reviewers who
completed a review last year
(`getExternalReviewerIdsByCompletedYear()`), only when
"enableEnrollmentMastheadReviewers" is on. It never reads the member's
choice. The wizard sets a reviewer row to "Appear" with no select
(`UserInvitationUserGroupsTable.vue`, "Auto-set masthead for reviewers
since they are always displayed"); the server rule above does not make
that exception. So the reviewer sentence ("… as a Reviewer.") is true
or false regardless of the condition below. It belonged to the
report on `pkp/pkp-lib#13370`
([report](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/45cd1a32ef61b9d29665cef315a41a7ac5245098/docs/reports/2026-09-29-pkp-lib-13370.md),
retired 2026-10-23 when that issue's second part made the reviewer
sentence follow reviewer listing), and to `pkp/pkp-lib#12628`
(open), which covers the Reviewer role's box doing nothing.

Reach:

- The masthead change email, `UserRoleMastheadUpdateNotify::setData()`,
  is sent by `PKPUserController::masthead()`. A manager triggers it by
  changing a role's masthead choice on a member's "Edit" page on Users &
  Roles, or in the wizard's rows for roles the person already holds.
  This email also reads only the member's choice: for a Reader it reports
  "New setting: Appear on the masthead" (checked in the code).
- The wizard's "Journal Masthead" column and the accept page's roles
  table (`AcceptInvitationUserRoles.vue`, "Author … Appear on the
  masthead", seen on screen) show the stored choice, not a promise.
  Whether they should hide it for a role the masthead does not list is a
  product question that the fix leaves open.
- The open report on `pkp/pkp-lib#13370` covers the same sentence, and
  the masthead change email, when a journal switches its enrollment
  masthead off (`enableEnrollmentMasthead`).

## Proposed fix

Let the email promise a listing only for a role the masthead lists. In
`getUserUserGroupSection()`:

```diff
-        if (isset($userUserGroup->masthead) && $userUserGroup->masthead) {
+        // A member is listed only for a role the masthead lists ("Consider role in masthead list")
+        // and only when they chose to appear for it, as on the Editorial Masthead page
+        if ($userGroup->masthead && !empty($userUserGroup->masthead)) {
```

([fix.diff](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/invitation-promises-masthead-for-unlisted-roles/fix.diff)).
A role the masthead does not list then gets the existing "Your name will
not appear in {journal}'s masthead as a {role}." This is true when the
email is sent and needs no new string. It covers roles held and offered.
For every role except Reviewer, it is the check the masthead page makes.

Tried on `main`, OJS, OMP and OPS. The walk's emails read "will not
appear … as a Author" and "… as a Reader", and keep "will appear … as a
Section editor" ("Series editor", "Moderator"). The neighbour check
invited Carlo Corino (OMP: Arthur Clark), who holds Author and Reader
with no choice made, to "Editorial Board Member" with "Appear on the
masthead". With and without the fix, the email read "will appear … as a
Editorial Board Member" and "will not appear" for Author and Reader.

**Alternatives**:

- Leave the sentence out for a role the masthead does not list. This is
  equally small, but it drops a statement that is true.
- Hide the masthead choice for such roles in the wizard. This is a
  product change to three screens, and it still needs the email fix for
  roles already stored as "Appear".

**What goes with it**:

- The masthead change email needs the same rule. For a role whose box is
  unticked, `PKPUserController::masthead()` would skip it, or
  `UserRoleMastheadUpdateNotify` would word it differently. The
  confirmation dialog says "The user will be notified of this change",
  so the team picks one. Not tried.
- `pkp/pkp-lib#13370`'s fix should add its context settings to the same
  condition, along with the reviewer rule above. Ideally that is one
  helper on the user group repository, next to `userOnMasthead()`, used
  by both mailables. Both emails would then ask what the masthead page
  asks.
- No stored data changes. The diff applies as written to
  `stable-3_5_0`, where the method is identical.
- Guard: an end-to-end check that reads the email; the kept script below
  does this. A unit test would be the first mailable test in pkp-lib,
  which has none. It would need the database, because `setData()` reads
  the invitation's payload and the role tables. It would also need a
  saved `UserRoleAssignmentInvite`, and it would have to read the
  rendered `rolesAdded` variable, since the method is private.

Small: one condition in one pkp-lib method, guarded by the end-to-end
check. A unit test would add a database-backed test of a kind pkp-lib
does not have yet.

## Evidence

- The script
  [walk.js](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/invitation-promises-masthead-for-unlisted-roles/walk.js)
  (helpers in
  [lib.js](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/invitation-promises-masthead-for-unlisted-roles/lib.js);
  the accept step reuses `accept()` of
  [invitation-sent-promises-decision-updates/lib.js](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/invitation-sent-promises-decision-updates/lib.js))
  takes steps 1–9 on OJS, OMP and OPS. With `neighbour` as its argument
  it walks only the neighbour check. Each run starts from an install
  freshly loaded from the default dataset:
  `PROBE_FEATURE=<feature> PROBE_AGENT=<id> node bin/probe.js all shared/playwright/checks/issues/invitation-promises-masthead-for-unlisted-roles/walk.js [neighbour]`.
- The walks showed no failed request and no script error. The dataset
  loads the Author and Reader assignments with no masthead choice, so
  their sentence reads "will not appear" until an "Appear" is stored.
  That is why the Steps offer the role. The walks ran on PostgreSQL; the
  fault involves no query.
- Datasets: pkp/datasets 3788b55 (2026-10-02), `main` and
  `stable-3_5_0`.
- Branch tips. `main`: OJS b84f8e2e44, OMP 3b0ecf794, OPS c8af945bb7;
  pkp-lib ddd8ab243a (OJS) and 3dc90c81a6 (OMP, OPS); ui-library
  64d67363 (OJS) and 280f98c5 (OMP, OPS). 3.5: OJS 091fb65453, OMP
  9c5e24246, OPS 38b61882d3; pkp-lib cf3f984335; ui-library d4e01883.
  3.4: OJS 75cc2d488b; pkp-lib 32b0f4b4af. 3.3: OJS ac77c9fb35; pkp-lib
  f6ab331645.
- Code reads, `main` and 3.5:
  - `UserRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify`, identical on both lines and in
    the three apps' pkp-lib, and `UserGroupHelper`;
  - `UserRoleAssignmentReceiveController::finalize()` and
    `UserRoleAssignmentInvitePayload`'s rules;
  - `SendInvitationStep::invitationInvitedEmail()`;
  - `AboutContextHandler::editorialMasthead()` and the repository's
    `getSortedMastheadUserGroups()`, `getMastheadUserIdsByRoleIds()` and
    `userOnMasthead()`;
  - `UserRoleMastheadUpdateNotify::setData()` and
    `PKPUserController::masthead()`;
  - ui-library's `UserInvitationUserGroupsTable.vue` and
    `AcceptInvitationUserRoles.vue`;
  - the three apps' `registry/userGroups.xml`.
- Code reads, 3.4 and 3.3: pkp-lib's `stable-3_4_0` and `stable-3_3_0`
  have no `classes/invitation/` and no per-member masthead choice. Their
  only "masthead" is the journal's Masthead settings form
  (`PKPMastheadForm`).
- Introduced: `git blame` on the condition leads to 7e3a26ea83, which
  created the mailable. Later commits (e050112af0 for
  `pkp/pkp-lib#11424`, 714d5d5aa4) only reformatted the code around it.
  The role's `masthead` attribute already existed then
  (`UserGroup::getMasthead()` at that commit).
- Upstream: searched pkp/pkp-lib, pkp/ojs, pkp/omp, pkp/ops and
  pkp/ui-library for the invitation email and the masthead, "will
  appear" masthead, and the method names. Read: `pkp/pkp-lib#11424`
  (closed; the email not matching the table's choice, fixed),
  `pkp/pkp-lib#11087` (closed; the old user form's masthead choice) and
  `pkp/pkp-lib#12628` (open; reviewers only, see Cause). None is this
  fault.
- Read in the code, not walked: a role later flagged for the masthead
  lists the members stored as "Appear" (`getMastheadUserIdsByRoleIds()`
  filters on the member's choice); a correction on the member's "Edit"
  page changes the stored choice that later invitations read
  (`PKPUserController::masthead()` updates `user_user_groups.masthead`);
  the compose step's body holds the role variables rather than the role
  lines (the walk did not record the editor's contents, but the sent
  emails carried the role lines). Not checked: MySQL. 3.4 and 3.3 were
  not walked.
