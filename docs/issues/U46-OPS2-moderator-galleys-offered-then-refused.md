Update 2026-10-29: "Delete" now fails for this Moderator too, on
`main` and the 3.5 branch; no 3.5 release carries that change yet, while
the other failures are in released 3.5. "Edit", a new galley and "Save
Order" still fail, and "Change File" still works. The recommended fix
is now one call in one handler, to `canEditRepresentations()`, the
check that already governs the galleys' files.

## Summary

On a preprint server, a Moderator whose assignment on the preprint has
"Permissions" unticked (the box that allows changes to the
publication) is offered the whole "Galleys" page before the preprint is
posted: "Add galley", "Order", and "Edit", "Change File", "More
Information" and "Delete" on each galley. Four of them fail. "Edit"
opens the galley's window with every field and "Save" greyed out. A new
galley's "Save" greys the "Create New Galley" window out, shows no
message and adds nothing; at the next page load a notice reads "This
galley can not be edited because it has already been published." "Save
Order" puts the old order back at once, with no message. "Delete" shows
"An unexpected error has occurred. Please reload the page and try
again." and the galley stays.

"Change File" works for the same Moderator, and once the preprint is
posted everything on the page does.

## Impact

- **Lost**: nothing stored.
- **Who**: a Moderator whose assignment on the preprint has
  "Permissions" unticked, before the preprint is posted. The box is
  ticked for Moderators by default, so it affects only a Moderator
  whose box an editor unticked.
- **Way round**: a Preprint Server Manager makes the change, or ticks
  the Moderator's "Permissions" box.

Medium: the tasks fail without saying why, so the Moderator cannot tell
they must ask, but a manager can do them and the setup is one an editor
chooses. It would be high if Moderators were restricted by default, low
if each failure said plainly that the action is not allowed.

## Steps to reproduce

Preconditions:

- PKP's default test dataset for `main`, OPS (the server
  `publicknowledge`). Submission 1, "The influence of lactation on the
  quantity and quality of cashmere production", is in Production and
  not posted. Its one galley is "PDF", and its Moderators David Buskins
  (`dbuskins`) and Stephanie Berardo (`sberardo`) have "Permissions"
  ticked.
- Any PDF file, named `u46w6-replacement.pdf` (step 10).
- Steps 1–5 add a second galley (the order needs two), store the
  list's order and untick the box on `dbuskins`'s assignment.

As the manager:

1. Sign in as `dbarnes` (password `dbarnesdbarnes`). Open "Active
   submissions" and press "View" on submission 1.
2. Side menu "Preprint" › "Galleys". Press "Add galley", type "Galley
   Label" `u46w6 Remote`, tick "This galley will be available at a
   separate website.", type `https://example.org/u46w6` as the address
   and press "Save".
3. The window "Upload a File Ready for Publication" opens: press
   "Cancel".
4. Press "Order" and "Save Order" (the list already reads "PDF", then
   `u46w6 Remote`). Until an order is saved every galley shares one
   position and the list shows them in whatever order the database
   returns (spec U46 A7), so step 9's "old order" would not be fixed.
5. Side menu "Production". In "Participants" press "David Buskins More
   Actions" › "Edit", untick the box under "Permissions" ("Allow this
   person to make changes to the publication, …") and press "OK". Sign
   out.

As the Moderator:

6. Sign in as `dbuskins`. On "Assigned to me" press "View" on
   submission 1, then side menu "Preprint" › "Galleys". Look above and
   below the table and open the "PDF" row's "More Actions".
7. "More Actions" › "Edit" on "PDF". Then press the window's "Close".
8. Press "Add galley", type "Galley Label" `u46w6 HTML` and press
   "Save". Then press the window's "Close" and reload the page.
9. Press "Order", press the down arrow on the "PDF" row (the list reads
   `u46w6 Remote`, then "PDF") and press "Save Order". Reload the page.
10. "More Actions" › "Change File" on "PDF". Upload
    `u46w6-replacement.pdf`, press "Continue", "Continue" and
    "Complete". Then press the "PDF" link in the list.
11. "More Actions" › "Delete" on `u46w6 Remote` and press "OK". Reload
    the page.

**Expected**, as recommended below: what the page offers works. In step 7
the window "Upload a File Ready for Publication" lets `dbuskins` change
the label and has "Save" and "Cancel". In step 8 "Save" closes the
window, the upload window opens for the new galley's file, and the list
shows `u46w6 HTML`. In step 9 the list keeps `u46w6 Remote` above "PDF",
also after the reload. In step 10 the "PDF" link downloads `u46w6-replacement.pdf`.
In step 11 `u46w6 Remote` leaves the list, also after the reload. (If
the team decides that the box keeps a Moderator off the galleys before
posting, the page should instead offer this Moderator a read-only
"View", as it does the Author.)

**Observed**: in step 6 "Order" and "Add galley" are there, and the
row menu offers "Edit", "Change File", "More Information" and "Delete".
In step 7 the window opens with "Galley Label", "Language", the remote
box and "URL Path" greyed out, "Save" greyed out and no "Cancel". In
step 8 "Save" leaves "Create New Galley" open with every field and
"Save" greyed out and no message; after the reload the list still reads
"PDF", `u46w6 Remote`, and a notice reads "This galley can not be
edited because it has already been published." In step 9 the list goes
back to "PDF", `u46w6 Remote` as soon as "Save Order" is pressed, and
stays so after the reload. Step 10 works: the "PDF" link
downloads `u46w6-replacement.pdf`. In step 11 a dialog "Error" reads "An
unexpected error has occurred. Please reload the page and try again.",
and after the reload `u46w6 Remote` is still listed. Both saves answer
as if they succeeded, and the delete answers with the refusal the page
does not show:

```
POST /index.php/publicknowledge/$$$call$$$/grid/preprint-galleys/preprint-galley-grid/update-galley?submissionId=1&publicationId=1&representationId=
200 {"status":true,"content":"<the same form, its fields disabled>"}

POST /index.php/publicknowledge/$$$call$$$/grid/preprint-galleys/preprint-galley-grid/save-sequence?submissionId=1&publicationId=1
200 {"status":true,"content":"","elementId":"0","events":[{"name":"dataChanged"}]}

POST /index.php/publicknowledge/$$$call$$$/grid/preprint-galleys/preprint-galley-grid/delete-galley?submissionId=1&publicationId=1&representationId=21
200 {"status":false,"content":"This galley can not be edited because it has already been published.","elementId":"0","events":[]}
```

Control: `sberardo`, whose box is still ticked, gets the same window in
step 7 with every field editable, "Save" and "Cancel".

## Cause

The page and the server apply two rules for the same Moderator.

The page: ui-library's `useGalleyManagerConfig.js`
(`lib/ui-library/src/managers/GalleyManager/`),
`getGalleyManagerConfiguration()`, gives every editorial role
(`ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, `ROLE_ID_MANAGER`, `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN`,
`ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT`) the whole set of actions and ignores
`canCurrentUserEditPublication`, which it reads only for the Author.
That rule was a deliberate decision. f9aca59b
(`pkp/pkp-lib#10760`) replaced the page's `canEdit` prop, which the
preprint server's workflow filled from the publication's edit
permission, with this role list, and the issue's notes say "Edit
actions are available for editorial roles when the publication is not
published". In July 2026 a comment on `pkp/pkp-lib#13039` restated it
for the page: "Editorial roles can edit galleys anytime (including
publication is published)".

The server: OPS's `PreprintGalleyGridHandler::canEdit()`
(`controllers/grid/preprintGalleys/PreprintGalleyGridHandler.php`)
lets a manager or sub-editor through only once the version is posted.
Before posting it asks `Repo::submission()->canEditPublication()`,
which for an assigned Moderator is their assignment's
`canChangeMetadata`, the "Permissions" box. The rule dates from 2020
(`pkp/pkp-lib#5750`), when the legacy grid built its actions from
`canEdit()` and so offered this Moderator a read-only "View" only.
`pkp/pkp-lib#10263` (OPS
[7d9c84e9b6](https://github.com/pkp/ops/commit/7d9c84e9b6f5ce9399c79b76c722fc2904234565),
2025) let managers and sub-editors edit galleys after posting, and left
the branch before posting as it was. The Vue page first followed the
server: at e88d2d20 (`pkp/ui-library#445`), which brought it to the
preprint server, a Moderator without the box got "View" as the grid
gave. The two parted at f9aca59b.

`pkp/pkp-lib#13637` then wrote a rule for the galleys' files that sides
with the page. pkp-lib's new `Repo::submission()->canEditRepresentations()`
(`classes/submission/Repository.php`,
[df42984b46](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/commit/df42984b467b6e76fa616eeeca43202f428744bc))
lets through anyone with an editorial assignment on the submission, and
holds the Author to `canEditPublication()`; its comment reads "Editorial
users keep the access their stage assignments give them".
`RepresentationUploadAccessPolicy` asks it, which is why "Change File"
works for this Moderator. In the same change OPS put `canEdit()` in
front of `deleteGalley` and `clearPubId`, so "Delete" now meets `canEdit()`'s check before posting, the box. The change's 3.4
and 3.3 backports ask `canEditRepresentations()` there instead.

`canEdit()` decides only some of the operations:

- `editGalleyTab` and `updateGalley` pass it to `PreprintGalleyForm` as
  `$isEditable`: the form renders disabled, and `validate()` adds
  `galley.cantEditPublished` under no field, so the window shows nothing
  and the message arrives as a notice at the next page load, worded for
  a published version.
- `initFeatures()` adds `OrderGridItemsFeature` only when it is true.
  Without it `saveSequence` stores nothing and still answers
  `"status":true`.
- `deleteGalley` answers `{"status":false}` with `galley.cantEditPublished`;
  the page shows its generic "Error" dialog instead of that text.
- `identifiers`, `updateIdentifiers` and `clearPubId` pass it to
  `PublicIdentifiersForm` or refuse with it, so the "Identifiers" tab,
  shown when galley identifiers are switched on, is read-only for this
  Moderator before posting (code).
- `addGalley` renders the empty form without it, so "Create New
  Galley" opens editable and the refusal comes only with its save.

Reach:

- A Preprint Server Manager passes `canEditPublication()` without an
  assignment, and a site administrator passes `canEdit()` first: not
  affected (code).
- OJS: `ArticleGalleyGridHandler::canEdit()` asks only for access to
  the Production stage, so a journal's editorial roles are never
  refused (code; spec U46 note q2 drove them all).
- The Author is not affected: the page reads
  `canCurrentUserEditPublication` for them, as the server does.
- OPS installs no assistant group, the fourth role the page lists
  (`registry/userGroups.xml`).

## Proposed fix

Let `PreprintGalleyGridHandler::canEdit()` return
`Repo::submission()->canEditRepresentations()`, the rule
`pkp/pkp-lib#13637` wrote for the same galleys' files, before and after
posting. An editorial assignment on the preprint is then enough, as the
page and `pkp/pkp-lib#13039` state. The Author keeps their gate: they
may change the galleys while the submission is unsubmitted, after that
only with "Permissions" ticked, and never once it is posted. The diff is
[fix.diff](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/moderator-galleys-offered-then-refused/fix.diff):

```php
    public function canEdit()
    {
        $user = Application::get()->getRequest()->getUser();
        return Repo::submission()->canEditRepresentations($this->getPublication(), $user);
    }
```

The diff replaces the method's body with this, drops the now unused
`PKPSubmission` import and rewrites the method's comment to state the
rule. It applies after posting too, so the method no longer reads the user's roles in the server
(`ASSOC_TYPE_USER_ROLES`). After posting, `canEditRepresentations()`
still passes the site administrator, a Preprint Server Manager (through
`_canUserAccessUnassignedSubmissions()`, without an assignment) and
every assigned Moderator, which keeps what `pkp/pkp-lib#10263` gave
them; it refuses a user who is only the preprint's Author, because
`canEditPublication()` locks a posted version for them.

Tried on `main`, OPS: every step gives the Expected. With the fix and
without it, the Author's rights stay as they were: `ccorino`, with his
"Permissions" unticked before posting, is offered "View" alone and its
window is read-only, and so is `ckwantes` on her posted submission 2. A
Moderator with the box unticked on posted submission 2 keeps the whole
page, with and without the fix.

**Alternatives**

- Give managers and sub-editors a pass at the top of `canEdit()`,
  posted or not (this report's earlier fix, also tried). It reads the
  user's roles in the server rather than on the preprint, so a
  Moderator of the server who is only a preprint's Author would pass
  too, whatever their author assignment's box says.
- Ask `canEditRepresentations()` in `deleteGalley` and `clearPubId`
  only: "Delete" works again, but "Edit", a new galley and "Save Order"
  stay refused.
- Make the page follow `canEdit()`: offer a Moderator without the box a
  read-only "View" and "More Information" before posting. This keeps
  the 3.4 behaviour, but it goes against the `pkp/pkp-lib#13039`
  ruleset and the rule `canEditRepresentations()` states, and "Change
  File" would then have to be refused too. The same question is open
  for the "Media" page (`pkp/pkp-lib#13647`, which recommends the
  server's rule there): the team may want to answer both at once.

**What goes with it**

- The "Identifiers" tab follows: with galley identifiers on, a
  Moderator without the box can now save and clear them before posting
  (code).
- Narrower than today in one case: a Moderator of the server who is
  only a preprint's Author is refused after posting, where the posted
  branch passed them (code).
- The refusal's missing message and its wording ("already been
  published" on a preprint not posted) stay for anyone still refused;
  after the fix no screen offers a refused save or delete.
- 3.5: `canEditRepresentations()` is there too, but the diff's second
  hunk, the method, does not apply: 3.5's `canEdit()` has one blank
  line after `$userRoles` where `main` has two, and calls
  `canEditPublication($submission->getId(), $user->getId())`. The same
  replacement of the method's body fits there; the import hunk applies.
- Guard: a scenario in spec U46 (a Moderator without "Permissions"
  edits, adds, reorders and deletes galleys before posting). OPS has no
  unit test of the galley grid to extend.

Small: one method in one handler, now a single call to the check the
same grid's uploads already use, and an e2e scenario.

## Evidence

- The script
  [walk.js](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/moderator-galleys-offered-then-refused/walk.js)
  (helpers in
  [lib.js](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/moderator-galleys-offered-then-refused/lib.js))
  takes steps 1–11 and the control on an install freshly loaded from the
  default dataset; `MODE=nb` takes the neighbour checks alone:
  `PROBE_FEATURE=<feature> PROBE_AGENT=<id> node bin/probe.js ops shared/playwright/checks/issues/moderator-galleys-offered-then-refused/walk.js`
  (`PKP_E2E_LINE=stable-3_5_0` in front for 3.5).
- Walked on `main` and 3.5, OPS, on PostgreSQL; datasets pkp/datasets
  2f0edb08 (2026-10-28). On 3.5 the row menu has no "More Information"
  and steps 7–11 show the same as on `main`. The step 8 notice is a
  notification the server queues for the user (`addError('', …)` on the
  form); it appeared on the next page load on both versions. Step 10:
  the walks on `main` and 3.5 read the galley's stored file
  (`u46w6-replacement.pdf`); the "PDF" link's download was read in the
  fix trial's walk, which does not touch the upload path.
- Branch tips. `main`: OPS 815fbaad1b, pkp-lib df42984b46, ui-library
  b44825b0. 3.5: OPS bd0ef09fd6, pkp-lib a6ed3df00a, ui-library
  a12b7523. 3.4: OPS 2e4bf7fd66, pkp-lib cbf5446d1b. 3.3: OPS
  9f42eb0a52, pkp-lib fc94a53416.
- Code reads. 3.5: `useGalleyManagerConfig.js` gives the editorial
  roles the whole set (without "More Information"), `canEdit()` is the
  same as on `main` but for the `canEditPublication()` arguments, and
  ef55e33bcd and pkp-lib a6ed3df00a are in no tag (the latest is
  `3_5_0-5`). 3.4: `PreprintGalleyGridHandler` adds
  "Add galley" and the ordering feature only when `canEdit()`, and
  `PreprintGalleyGridRow` offers "Edit" (else "View"), the upload and
  "Delete" only when editable; its `canEdit()` refuses everyone once
  posted and asks `canEditPublication()` before; b1fd1f06ee is the
  backport the Cause names. 3.3: the same in
  `ArticleGalleyGridHandler.inc.php` and `ArticleGalleyGridRow.inc.php`
  (OPS kept the journal's class names there), backport 574b1b17e0.
  Read with `git show upstream/stable-3_4_0:…` and
  `upstream/stable-3_3_0` in the `main` OPS checkout and
  `origin/stable-3_4_0`, `origin/stable-3_3_0` in its `lib/pkp`.
- Introduced: at e88d2d20 (`pkp/ui-library#445`), which brought the
  GalleyManager to the preprint server, `workflowConfigEditorialOPS.js`
  passed `canEdit: permissions.canEditPublication`, and without it
  `useGalleyManagerActions.js` left out "Add galley" and "Order" and
  offered "View" alone. f9aca59b (`pkp/ui-library#478`) dropped that
  prop from the store and added the role list
  (`GalleyManagerConfiguration.permissions`, checked with
  `hasCurrentUserAtLeastOneAssignedRoleInStage`). The server side: `git log -L` on `canEdit()` leads to 935df35d66
  (`pkp/pkp-lib#5750`, 2020) for the `canEditPublication()` branch and
  to 7d9c84e9b6 (`pkp/pkp-lib#10263`) for the posted branch; ab4b990d96
  (`pkp/pkp-lib#13109`) only changed the call's arguments.
- Upstream searches (pkp/pkp-lib, pkp/ops, pkp/ui-library; 2026-10-02
  and again 2026-10-29): galley and moderator, delete, permission and
  order words, the notice's text, `PreprintGalleyGridHandler`,
  `canEdit`, `canEditRepresentations`, `canCurrentUserEditPublication`.
  Found: `pkp/pkp-lib#13637` (closed; the change above, about the
  galleys' files, not this fault), `pkp/pkp-lib#13647` (open; the
  "Media" page's twin), `pkp/pkp-lib#13039` (closed; the Author's
  access to the page, the ruleset in a comment of 2026-07-27),
  `pkp/pkp-lib#13107` (closed; a "Save Order" server error, fixed) and
  `pkp/pkp-lib#10760` (closed; built the page, with the note quoted in
  the Cause). None is this fault.
- Not walked: the "Identifiers" tab, a Moderator of the server who is
  only a preprint's Author (before or after posting, with or without the
  fix), the alternatives, and the fix on 3.5.
