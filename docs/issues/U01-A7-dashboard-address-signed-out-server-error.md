**Update 2026-10-29.** pkp tracks the fault as `pkp/pkp-lib#13651`,
filed from the `ore` line, and PR `pkp/pkp-lib#13652` (open) fixes it.
The PR names a second address that fails the same way: "Logout as"
(`…/en/login/signOutAsUser`) opened signed out, with no `redirectUrl`.
Walked on `main` and 3.5, all three apps: it answers the same 500. The
Summary, Observed, Reach and Proposed fix name it. The PR's change was
tried on `main` and fixes both addresses.

## Summary

The server fails when a signed-out visitor opens the Dashboard address
that ends at the word "dashboard", with or without a final slash
(`…/index.php/publicknowledge/en/dashboard`,
`…/index.php/publicknowledge/en/dashboard/`). The visitor gets an empty
error page instead of the Login page. Longer Dashboard addresses, such as
`…/dashboard/editorial`, open the Login page and return there after
signing in. The "Logout as" address (`…/en/login/signOutAsUser`), opened
signed out with no `redirectUrl`, fails the same way.

The address without the slash is the "submission dashboard" link in
the monthly "Outstanding editorial tasks" email to managers and section
editors. A bookmark or a typed address cut short at "dashboard" leads
there too.

## Impact

- **Lost**: nothing stored. The empty error page has no message and no
  link onward.
- **Who**: anyone signed out who opens that address. The email goes out
  by default: an install runs the reminder on the first of each month,
  to every manager and section editor of a journal, press or preprint
  server who has submissions waiting on them, unless they have turned
  the reminder off under their profile's notifications. A sign-in ends
  after 7 days without a visit by default (30 with "Keep me logged in"),
  so an editor who has not visited since is signed out when they press
  the link. The same email's links to each submission work.
- **Way round**: open the home page, press "Login" and sign in. The
  Dashboard then opens from the user menu.

Medium: the link the app mails each month to the managers and section
editors with waiting submissions answers an empty error page whenever
they are signed out, with a way round once they know to sign in first.

## Steps to reproduce

Preconditions:

- PKP's default test dataset for `main`, OJS (OMP and OPS the same).
  Nothing is created.

Steps:

1. Signed out (a fresh browser, or after "Logout"), open the Dashboard
   address with nothing after "dashboard":
   `/index.php/publicknowledge/en/dashboard`.
2. On the page that opens, sign in as `dbarnes` (password
   `dbarnesdbarnes`).
3. Control: sign out, then open
   `/index.php/publicknowledge/en/dashboard/editorial`.
4. On the Login page that opens, sign in as `dbarnes`.

**Expected**: step 1 opens the Login page, as step 3 does. Signing in
there (step 2) leads `dbarnes` to his Dashboard, "Assigned to me".

**Observed**: step 1 answers HTTP 500 with an empty error page, with no
title and no form, so step 2 cannot be taken. The server log:

```
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to a member function getId() on null in …/lib/pkp/classes/core/PKPPageRouter.php:412
[500]: GET /index.php/publicknowledge/en/dashboard
```

The address with a final slash
(`/index.php/publicknowledge/en/dashboard/`), `/en/dashboard/index`,
the address without a language (`/index.php/publicknowledge/dashboard`,
which redirects to the one in step 1) and the "Logout as" address
without a `redirectUrl` (`/index.php/publicknowledge/en/login/signOutAsUser`)
answer the same. With a `redirectUrl`, "Logout as" goes to that page. In steps 3 and 4 the Login page opens at
`login?source=%2Findex.php%2Fpublicknowledge%2Fen%2Fdashboard%2Feditorial`,
and signing in leads to "Assigned to me (17)" (OMP "Assigned to me (4)",
OPS "Assigned to me (0)").

## Cause

`PKPDashboardHandler::authorize()`
(`lib/pkp/pages/dashboard/PKPDashboardHandler.php`, line 117) handles the
bare address before any authorization runs. `Core::getOp()` trims the
slashes at the path's ends before splitting it, so neither address has
an operation, and it falls back to `index`. The apps'
`pages/dashboard/index.php` send the operation `index` to the app's
`APP\pages\dashboard\DashboardHandler` (a `PKPDashboardHandler`
subclass) with no `DashboardPage`. For that handler, `authorize()` calls
`PKPPageRouter::redirectHome()` before it adds `PKPSiteAccessPolicy`:

```php
if (!$this->dashboardPage) {
    $pkpPageRouter = $request->getRouter();
    $pkpPageRouter->redirectHome($request);
}
$this->addPolicy(new PKPSiteAccessPolicy($request, null, $roleAssignments));
```

`PKPPageRouter::getHomeUrl()` chooses the dashboard by the user's roles
in the context and starts with `Auth::user()->getId()` (lines 411–412).
With no user signed in, that call is the fatal error. For every other
private address, `PKPSiteAccessPolicy` refuses a signed-out visitor and
`PKPPageRouter::handleAuthorizationFailure()` then calls
`Validation::redirectLogin()`, with the address asked for as `source`.
The early `redirectHome()` means neither is reached.

The role-based choice in `getHomeUrl()` is older than 9113dec. What
9113dec added, for `pkp/pkp-lib#10670` ("`/dashboard` -> to specific
dashboard based on role"), was sending the bare address through it: the
`redirectHome()` call in `authorize()`, ahead of any policy, and `index`
taken out of the editorial dashboard's role assignment. Before it,
`index` opened the editorial dashboard with `index` in that role
assignment, so the policies ran first and a signed-out visitor got the
Login page. The same change pointed the email variable `{$submissionsUrl}`
(`ContextEmailVariable::getSubmissionsUrl()`) at the bare address;
before, it pointed at `submissions`.

Reach:

- The "submission dashboard" link of "Outstanding editorial tasks"
  (`EditorialReminder`) is `{$submissionsUrl}` (read in the email the
  task sent on OJS). Any email template a journal, press or preprint
  server edits to use `{$submissionsUrl}` links there too (in the code).
- The old `/submissions` address is served by the legacy
  `PKP\pages\dashboard\DashboardHandler`, which authorizes first, so it
  opens Login and then the Dashboard (on screen). Not affected.
- "Logout as" (`LoginHandler::signOutAsUser()`) has no access policy:
  `LoginHandler::authorize()` adds one for `signInAsUser` only. Without
  a `redirectUrl` it sends the visitor home through `sendHome()` and
  `redirectHome()`, so a signed-out visitor at
  `login/signOutAsUser` gets the same 500 (walked on `main` and 3.5,
  all three apps; named by `pkp/pkp-lib#13652`). How a signed-out user
  comes to press "Logout as" (a page left open after the session ended,
  say) was not driven.
- The other callers of `redirectHome()` and `getHomeUrl()` run with a
  user signed in or after their policies (in the code):
  - `LoginHandler`, elsewhere: when already signed in, or after signing in;
  - `AdminHandler`, after its policies;
  - `PKPNavigationMenuService`, only for a signed-in user;
  - the legacy `PKP\pages\dashboard\DashboardHandler::index()`.

  One more is not settled: `LoginHandler::savePassword()` sends the
  user home after `Validation::login()` without checking the result
  (Evidence).

## Proposed fix

Send a signed-out visitor to Login before choosing the dashboard by role, the way
`PKPPageRouter::handleAuthorizationFailure()` does
([fix.diff](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/dashboard-address-signed-out-server-error/fix.diff)):

This is an excerpt of the diff; the linked fix.diff has the full context.

The Login page then carries the bare address as `source`. After signing
in, that address chooses the dashboard by role, so `pkp/pkp-lib#10670`'s
rule holds and the email link needs no change.

Tried on `main` in the three apps. Step 1 opened the Login page at
`login?source=%2Findex.php%2Fpublicknowledge%2Fen%2Fdashboard`, and step 2
led `dbarnes` to "Assigned to me". The address with a final slash
(Login at `login?source=%2Findex.php%2Fpublicknowledge%2Fen%2Fdashboard%2F`),
`/dashboard/index` and the address without a language opened Login too.

Signed in, the bare address led `dbarnes` to `dashboard/editorial` and
the author (`amwandenga`, OMP `aclark`, OPS `ccorino`) to
`dashboard/mySubmissions`, and the old `/submissions` address behaved as
in Reach, the same with the fix in and out. No request failed with the
fix in.

This guard does not cover "Logout as" (Reach). The change in PR
`pkp/pkp-lib#13652` covers both: `getHomeUrl()` returns the Login
address, with the address asked for as `source`, when no user is signed
in. That is the fix the 2026-08-25 review of this entry ruled for. Tried
on `main` in the three apps (2026-10-29): step 1 opened the Login page at
`login?source=%2Findex.php%2Fpublicknowledge%2Fen%2Fdashboard` and step 2
led `dbarnes` to "Assigned to me"; the address with a final slash and
"Logout as" without a `redirectUrl` opened Login too, and "Logout as"
with one went to that page. No request failed with the change in.

**Alternatives**

- Return the journal's home page from `getHomeUrl()` when no user is
  signed in. That ends the crash, but the visitor lands on the home page
  instead of Login and the address is lost. PR `pkp/pkp-lib#13652`
  returns the Login address instead, which keeps it.
- Authorize first, as the old handler did: list `index` in the role
  assignments and choose the dashboard in `index()`. That also works, but a
  signed-in Reader at the bare address would get the access-denied page
  where today they go to the journal's home page.
- Point `{$submissionsUrl}` at `dashboard/editorial`. That fixes only
  the email, and the variable serves any recipient, so choosing by role
  is right.

**What goes with it**

- No stored data, REST API or plugin hook is involved.
- Backport: on 3.5 the diff applies as it stands (with an offset). 3.4
  and 3.3 do not need it.
- Guard: an end-to-end check that the bare Dashboard address, opened
  signed out, shows the Login page and leads to the Dashboard after
  signing in. In pkp-e2e this is a **Planned** item in spec U01.

This is a proposal; the team decides. Small: one guard and one import in
one shared handler, following the router's own pattern, and one check.

## Evidence

- Kept script:
  [walk.js](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/dashboard-address-signed-out-server-error/walk.js),
  with its
  [lib.js](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/dashboard-address-signed-out-server-error/lib.js).
  It takes the Steps on an install freshly loaded from the default
  dataset (pkp/datasets 401a013, 2026-10-06, PostgreSQL). From a pkp-e2e
  checkout:
  `PROBE_FEATURE=<feature> PROBE_AGENT=<id> node bin/probe.js all shared/playwright/checks/issues/dashboard-address-signed-out-server-error/walk.js`
  (`PKP_E2E_LINE=stable-3_5_0` in front for 3.5). With `neighbour` as its
  argument it walks the fix's neighbour paths instead. The fix was tried
  with `node bin/try-fix.js apply shared/playwright/checks/issues/dashboard-address-signed-out-server-error/fix.diff ojs omp ops`.
- 3.5 answered the same 500 at line 412 on each app, the address with
  a final slash included, and steps 3 and 4 behaved as on `main`.
- 2026-10-29: the walk, with the "Logout as" reads added, on fresh
  dataset fleets (pkp/datasets 2f0edb08, 2026-10-28) at `main` (OJS
  7705b2aeb8, OMP 3583c1bfd and OPS 815fbaad1b, pkp-lib df42984b46) and
  `stable-3_5_0` (OJS 851416bc2d, OMP 50b83d1e6 and OPS bd0ef09fd6,
  pkp-lib a6ed3df00a): every Step and read as above on each app, the
  "Logout as" read included. The PR's change (`pkp/pkp-lib#13652` at
  its head on 2026-10-29) was tried on `main` with
  `node bin/try-fix.js apply` on its diff (paths under `lib/pkp/`), the
  walk rerun, then reverted.
  Nothing here depends on the database.
- The fix's neighbour paths (signed in, and the old `/submissions`
  address) were walked on 2026-10-04.
- The email: on the OJS `main` install, the editorial reminder task was
  run by hand (`php lib/pkp/tools/scheduler.php test
  --name='PKP\task\EditorialReminders'`, then `php lib/pkp/tools/jobs.php
  run`). The email to `dbarnes`, "Outstanding editorial tasks for Journal
  of Public Knowledge", links "submission dashboard" to
  `/index.php/publicknowledge/en/dashboard`, and each listed submission
  to `dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId=<id>`. OMP and OPS send
  the same text from the shared pkp-lib (read in the code, not sent).
- Tips:
  - `main`: OJS 92bc2bb467 (pkp-lib e60013c77f), OMP a0e6d0a8b and OPS
    7e34fdd57e (pkp-lib 5a5ab2d6c7).
  - `stable-3_5_0`: OJS b8f5e9a951, OMP 7d6b00060 and OPS acc0de0586
    (pkp-lib 6d7f1540b6).
  - `stable-3_4_0`: OJS d68934d0d1, OMP 0aec65441f, OPS acd8ae704b
    (pkp-lib 767353f4fe).
  - `stable-3_3_0`: OJS ac77c9fb35, OMP 8e72fc8836, OPS c5532e2161
    (pkp-lib ac3fa73402).
- Code reads:
  - `PKPDashboardHandler::authorize()` on `main` (the guard at line 117,
    `redirectHome()` at 119) and 3.5 (lines 106 and 108), and
    `getHomeUrl()` on both (lines 411–412). On 3.5 the apps'
    `pages/dashboard/index.php` also route `index` to
    `APP\pages\dashboard\DashboardHandler` without a page, and
    `ContextEmailVariable::getSubmissionsUrl()` also gives `dashboard`.
  - 3.4 and 3.3: none of the apps has `pages/dashboard/index.php`.
    pkp-lib's `PKP\pages\dashboard\DashboardHandler` (3.3: the
    unnamespaced `DashboardHandler` in `DashboardHandler.inc.php`) lists
    `index` in its role assignment and
    authorizes through `PKPSiteAccessPolicy` before `index()` runs. On
    3.4, `getSubmissionsUrl()` gives `submissions`.
  - Every `redirectHome()` and `getHomeUrl()` caller in pkp-lib and the
    apps, for the reach.
- Introduced: `git blame` on the `redirectHome()` call names 9113dec
  (`pkp/pkp-lib#10782`); the `if` line above it blames to 6e9bcb91c0c, a
  reformat. 9113dec changed `pages/dashboard/PKPDashboardHandlerNext.php`,
  which fca196cf22 (`pkp/pkp-lib#10766`, 2025-03-18) renamed to
  `PKPDashboardHandler.php`, so read it with `git show 9113dec --
  pages/dashboard/PKPDashboardHandlerNext.php`. The app commits that
  route `index` to `APP\pages\dashboard\DashboardHandler` without a page
  are OJS b065b61a94 (`pkp/ojs#4583`), OMP
  57b0965dc (`pkp/omp#1804`) and OPS 5f7424f9e7 (no PR found). Before
  them, 0608d6e204 (OJS), 98e9fbdba (OMP) and 6d23162966 (OPS) sent
  `index` to the editorial dashboard.
- Not driven: a reviewer's or an assistant's landing through the fixed
  Login page; with the fix in, signing in after opening the address
  with a final slash; and 3.4 and 3.3.
- Unverified: whether `LoginHandler::savePassword()` (the forced
  password change) can reach `getHomeUrl()` with no user. It sends the
  user home after `Validation::login()` whatever the result, and
  `Validation::registerUserSession()` refuses a disabled account, but
  whether `Auth::user()` is then empty was not settled. The getHomeUrl()
  hardening under Alternatives would cover it.
- `pkp/pkp-lib#13651` (filed 2026-10-29, on the `ore` line) and its
  PR `pkp/pkp-lib#13652` were read on 2026-10-29; neither links pkp-e2e.
  The `ore` line was not driven here.
- Tracker search (2026-10-04, repeated in pkp/pkp-lib and pkp/ojs on
  2026-10-07): pkp/pkp-lib, pkp/ojs, pkp/omp, pkp/ops and
  pkp/ui-library, for the dashboard address signed out, an empty error
  page or 500, "getId() on null", `getHomeUrl`, `redirectHome` and
  `PKPDashboardHandler`. None is this fault (`pkp/pkp-lib#13443`, open,
  is a 500 on the public pages for a disabled user's session, another
  fault). `pkp/pkp-lib#10670` is the
  closed issue that set the redirect rules.
