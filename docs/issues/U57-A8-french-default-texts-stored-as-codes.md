2026-10-04: added a preprint server's file component names (spec U58
A9), seen on screen and saved again by the list's "Restore Defaults"
(steps 13 to 16), and corrected the 3.5 backport, the count of saved
texts and the fix's call sites.

2026-11-03: added the role invitation email of a preprint server whose
primary language is French, which names the Moderator and manager roles
by their codes (spec U07 OPS4, steps 17 to 22), and walked steps 1 to 12
again at the branch tips. The email reads the role name the server saved, so the
Cause and the fix are unchanged; the fix was tried on the email too.

## Summary

On a press or preprint server that offers French (Canada), the French
"Submissions" page shows the internal text codes
"##default.contextSettings.authorGuidelines##" and
"##default.contextSettings.checklist##" where the author guidelines and
the submission checklist should be. A French author starting "Make a
Submission" is asked to confirm the checklist under that code.

A preprint server's French "Privacy Statement" page is only
"##default.contextSettings.privacyStatement##". Its Moderator and
manager roles are named "##default.groups.name.sectionEditor##" and
"##default.groups.name.manager##" in French: on the public "Editorial
Masthead", on Users & Roles › "Roles" and in the users list's "Roles"
column. On a server whose primary language is French, the email
inviting someone to either of these roles names it by the same code. The server's list of file
components, under Settings › Workflow › "Soumission", names seven of
them by codes ("##default.genres.researchInstrument##" and six more),
and so does each one's "Modifier" (Edit) window.

The codes are saved into the press's or server's settings when it is
created with French or French is added, so they stay, and no one is
told. "Reload defaults" for French saves the codes again over a French
text the manager typed, and the components list's "Restaurer les
valeurs par défaut" (Restore Defaults) saves the components' codes
again. A manager can replace each one on screen.

Two things combine: the press's and the server's French (Canada)
translations lack these texts, and the code that saves default texts
stores the code when a language has no text, where an empty box would
show the English text. The same happens wherever an application's own
default texts are untranslated: in about fourteen more languages on a
press, nine on a preprint server (French (France) among them) and some
twenty on a journal (the list under Cause).

## Impact

- **Lost.** Readers and authors working in the language get no author
  guidelines, checklist or (on a server) privacy statement, and a
  server's public masthead heads its moderators and managers with codes.
  A French author must tick "Oui, ma soumission répond à toutes ces
  exigences." without seeing the requirements; ticking it lets them go
  on. A French text a manager typed is lost to "Reload defaults". On a
  server whose primary language is French, a person invited as
  Moderator or manager is not told which role is offered: the email
  names it only by the code. Its "Accept Invitation" link still opens
  the account form, and the other roles' invitations name them in
  French.
- **Who.** Readers, authors and managers of every press and preprint
  server that offers French (Canada), and of a press, server or journal
  in one of the other languages, whenever they use it in that language.
  On a server whose primary language is French, everyone invited to its
  Moderator or manager role.
- **Way round.** A manager types a text into each box, or empties it so
  the English text shows, and renames the roles under Users & Roles ›
  "Roles" (the invitation email then uses the new French name) and the
  components in their "Modifier" windows. Codes already
  saved stay until a manager does so: changing only the code that saves
  the defaults would not remove them, so the proposed fix includes an
  upgrade step that repairs them.

Medium: public pages and a submission's first screen show a code in
place of their text in one language, silently, but no task is stopped
and a manager can replace each text on screen; the privacy statement and
the masthead's role names are public, but no one's work depends on
them. An invitee who cannot tell the role from the email still reaches
the account form that accepts it, and the inviting manager can say
which role it is. It would
rise if an author could not begin a submission, an invitation could not
be accepted, or there were no way round.

## Steps to reproduce

Preconditions:

- PKP's default test dataset for OMP `main` or OPS `main`: the press or
  server `publicknowledge`, which offers English (primary) and French
  (Canada) for its pages and its forms. The journal of the OJS dataset is
  the control.

Reading the French pages (not signed in):

1. Open `/index.php/publicknowledge/fr_CA/about/submissions`
   ("Soumissions").
2. On OPS, open `/index.php/publicknowledge/fr_CA/about/privacy`.
3. On OPS, open `/index.php/publicknowledge/fr_CA/about/editorialMasthead`
   ("Entête").

The users list:

4. Sign in as `admin`. Open
   `/index.php/publicknowledge/fr_CA/management/settings/access`, the
   "Utilisateurs" tab, and read the "Rôles" column.

Reloading the French defaults:

5. Back in English, open Settings › Workflow,
   `/index.php/publicknowledge/en/management/settings/workflow`, then
   "Submission" › "Author Guidance". Press "French" above the form,
   type "Lignes directrices u57u4 de la maison." into "Author
   Guidelines", and press "Save".
6. Open step 1's page again.
7. Open Settings › Website,
   `/index.php/publicknowledge/en/management/settings/website`, then
   "Setup" › "Languages". On the "French/français" row, open the arrow,
   press "Reload defaults", then "OK". (Only the Site Administrator's rows carry the arrow.)
8. Open step 1's page again (on OPS, step 2's too).

Making a submission in French:

9. Sign in as the author `aclark` (OMP) or `ccorino` (OPS). Open "Make a
   Submission" in French, `/index.php/publicknowledge/fr_CA/submission`,
   and read "Liste de vérification de la soumission".

A new press or server with French:

10. Sign in as `admin`. Administration › "Hosted Presses" ("Hosted
    Servers") › "Create Press" ("Create Server"): name "u57u4 Press"
    ("u57u4 Server"), acronym "u57u4", contact "u57u4" and
    u57u4@mailinator.com, country Canada, path `u57u4`, English and
    French ticked, English primary. "Save".
11. Open `/index.php/u57u4/fr_CA/about/submissions` (on OPS, also
    `/index.php/u57u4/fr_CA/about/privacy`).
12. On OPS, open `/index.php/u57u4/fr_CA/management/settings/access`,
    the "Rôles" tab.

The components list (OPS; steps 1 to 12 leave it as loaded, so it needs
no reload):

13. Sign in as `rvaca`. Open the menu under the initials at the top
    right and, under "Change Language", choose "français".
14. Open "Paramètres" › "Flux des travaux"
    (`/index.php/publicknowledge/fr_CA/management/settings/workflow`), and
    on the tab "Soumission" press the fourth side tab, under
    "Métadonnées". Read the rows' names.
15. Open the arrow at the start of the second row, then "Modifier", and
    read the French "Nom" box. Press "Annuler".
16. Press "Restaurer les valeurs par défaut", then "OK". Read the rows'
    names again.

A role invitation on a server whose primary language is French. The
dataset's server is English-primary, and the invitation email names
roles in the server's primary language, so these steps create a server
that has French as its primary language. On OJS and OMP, the control,
the same steps use "Hosted Journals" › "Create Journal" ("Hosted
Presses" › "Create Press") in step 17 and the role "Section editor"
("Series editor") in step 20. The email in step 22 is read wherever the
install delivers mail: the mail catcher its `[email]` SMTP settings
point to, or the application log with `default = log` there.

17. Sign in as `admin`. Administration › "Hosted Servers" › "Create
    Server": name "u07hk3 Server", then press "French" above the form
    and name it "Server u07hk3 FR"; acronym "u07hk3" in both; contact
    "u07hk3" and u07hk3@example.org; country Canada; path `u07hk3`;
    English and French ticked, French primary. "Save".
18. Open Settings › Users & Roles in English,
    `/index.php/u07hk3/en/management/settings/access`, and press "Invite
    to a role".
19. Type u07hk3-inv@example.org and press "Search User".
20. Given Name "Ivo", Family Name "Invitee"; role "Moderator", today's
    date, "Appear on the masthead". "Save And Continue".
21. Press "Invite user to the role".
22. Read the email sent to u07hk3-inv@example.org.

**Expected.** Every French page shows a text a reader can use: French
where the application has one, as the journal shows ("Les auteur.e.s
sont invité.e.s à soumettre un article à cette revue. …",
"Rédacteur-trice de rubrique"), otherwise the press's or server's
English text, as for any French box left empty. Where no French name
exists, the roles are named in English ("Moderator", "Preprint Server
manager"). Step 6 shows the typed text; after step 7 the French
guidelines are the default again, French or English, never a code.
Steps 14 to 16 name every component in French, or in English where no
French name exists, as the journal's list does ("Instruments de
recherche"). Step 22 names the role "Moderator", as a journal's email
under the same steps names its Section editor "Rédacteur-trice de
rubrique" and a press's its Series editor "Rédacteur/Rédactrice en
chef de la série".

**Observed.** Steps 1, 8 and 11 (OMP; OPS likewise under "Directives
aux auteurs-es" and "Liste de vérification de la soumission"):

```
Lignes directrices s'adressant aux auteurs
##default.contextSettings.authorGuidelines##
Liste de vérification pour la préparation de la soumission
##default.contextSettings.checklist##
```

- Steps 2, 8 and 11 (OPS): "Déclaration de confidentialité" over
  "##default.contextSettings.privacyStatement##".
- Step 3 (OPS): "Entête", then the heading
  "##default.groups.name.sectionEditor##" over Stephanie Berardo, David
  Buskins and Minoti Inoue.
- Step 4 (OPS): "##default.groups.name.manager##" for `admin`, Ramiro
  Vaca and Daniel Barnes, "##default.groups.name.sectionEditor##" for
  David Buskins and the other Moderators.
- Step 6: the typed text in place of the code; step 8: the code again.
- Step 9: under "Liste de vérification de la soumission *
  Obligatoire", "##default.contextSettings.checklist##", then the box
  "Oui, ma soumission répond à toutes ces exigences."
- Step 12 (OPS): "##default.groups.name.manager##" and
  "##default.groups.name.sectionEditor##" in the role names column.
- Steps 14 and 16 (OPS): rows 2 to 8 read
  "##default.genres.researchInstrument##",
  "##default.genres.researchMaterials##",
  "##default.genres.researchResults##", "##default.genres.transcripts##",
  "##default.genres.dataAnalysis##", "##default.genres.dataSet##" and
  "##default.genres.sourceTexts##", between "Texte de la prépublication"
  and "Multimédias". Step 15: the French "Nom" box holds
  "##default.genres.researchInstrument##", the English one "Research
  Instrument".
- Step 22: the email "You are invited to new roles", in English (the
  language of the inviting manager's screens), reads:

  ```
  Newly assigned roles

  1.
  ##default.groups.name.sectionEditor##
  Starting from 2026-11-03

  Your name will appear in the Server u07hk3 FR's masthead as a ##default.groups.name.sectionEditor##.
  ```

  The compose step of step 20 shows the role lines only as
  `{$ROLESADDED}`, so the code first shows in the sent email.

No request failed and no script error showed. The journal shows French
texts at every step, and the press's and server's English pages show
their English texts.

## Cause

The default texts are translated from the application's locale files
and saved as the context's own data. `PKPSchemaService::getDefault()`
(`lib/pkp/classes/services/PKPSchemaService.php`) translates each
context property's `defaultLocaleKey` with `__()` for each language.
It serves `PKPContextService::add()` (a new context's languages) and
`restoreLocaleDefaults()` (ticking a "Forms" language, ticking a
"Submission" language that is not yet a metadata language, and "Reload
defaults").
`UserGroup\Repository::installLocale()` names the default roles the same
way, for every language the site has installed.

`Locale::translate()` answers a key that has no text in the language
with `'##' . $key . '##'`, and does not fall back to another language
(PKP's stated design, `pkp/pkp-lib#784`). These writers save that
placeholder, "##default.contextSettings.checklist##" for example, as the
French text or role name. Other installers already guard against it:
`emailTemplate\DAO::installEmailTemplateLocaleData()` and
`editorialTask\Repository` set a missing-key handler that returns `''`
before their `__()` calls and restore the previous one after them, and
the 3.5 upgrade `I10620_EditorialBoardMemberRole` skips a name that
comes back as `##…##` in every language but the context's primary one,
where it saves the code too. The context defaults, the role names, the
file types (`GenreDAO::installDefaults()`) and, on `main` only, the
contributor roles (`PKPContextService::add()`) do not.

The texts are missing because the keys are the applications' own
(pkp-lib carries none of them) and the French (Canada) files leave them
empty. `LocaleFile` drops an empty `msgstr`. OMP's
`locale/fr_CA/default.po` has `default.contextSettings.authorGuidelines`
and `default.contextSettings.checklist` empty. OPS's has 26 entries
empty. Eighteen reach a saved setting: those two, `privacyStatement`,
`forReaders`, `forAuthors`, `forLibrarians`, `openAccessPolicy`, the
name and abbreviation of `manager` and `sectionEditor`, and seven file
types. The other eight do no harm: the two roles' plurals are never
saved (`UserGroup\Repository::installSettings()` keeps only a role's
name and abbreviation keys), `section.default.policy` is written only in
the primary language, and pkp-lib's French (Canada) file supplies the
five `default.submission.step.*` texts. OJS's file has them all.

Reach:

- On screen (`main` and 3.5): every place the Summary names. The
  invitation email reads the role's name and the server's name in the
  server's primary language: `UserRoleAssignmentInvite::getMailable()`
  passes `$context->getPrimaryLocale()` to `setData()`, and
  `UserRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify::getUserUserGroupSection()` reads
  `getLocalizedData('name', $locale)` and `getName($locale)`. Its own
  lines ("Newly assigned roles", the "will appear" sentence) come from
  `__()` with no locale, so in the sender's language. The saved French
  name is the code, which is not empty, so it is used; on an
  English-primary server the email names the role "Moderator". The components list's "Restore
  Defaults"
  (`GenreGridHandler::restoreGenres()`) calls
  `GenreDAO::installDefaults()` for the server's form languages.
- Not walked: the French submission wizard, which offers the same
  component names for an uploaded file. Seen only in the database:
  OPS's French "For Readers", "For Authors", "For Librarians" and open
  access policy, which no OPS screen shows.
- Other languages (code, `main`), the same gap in each application's
  own `default.po`:
  - OMP: guidelines and checklist in Arabic, Catalan, Greek, Scottish
    Gaelic, Galician, Hungarian, Norwegian Bokmål, Russian, Turkish and
    Vietnamese, the guidelines in Swedish.
  - OPS: as French (Canada) in Catalan, French (France) and Norwegian
    Bokmål; guidelines and checklist in Spanish and Portuguese.
  - OJS: guidelines and checklist in 15 languages (Greek and Vietnamese
    among them). In Albanian, Kabyle, Lower and Upper Sorbian and
    Northern Sami also the "For Readers", "For Authors" and "For
    Librarians" texts, the role names and the file types, and in all
    but Northern Sami the privacy statement.
  - Languages with no `default.po` at all store every text as a code:
    OMP Central Kurdish, Persian and Kyrgyz; OPS Croatian, Indonesian,
    Kyrgyz and Turkish; OJS eight languages.
- Not this fault, read at display time from missing keys (like spec U69
  [A15](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/docs/specs/U69-monograph-landing-page.md#a15)):
  OMP's signed-in French "Submissions" page shows
  "##about.onlineSubmissions.submissionActions##" and its "Roles" tab
  "##workflow.review.externalReview##"; the French users list of all
  three applications shows "##invitation.header##",
  "##userAccess.search##" and other pkp-lib keys.

## Proposed fix

1. In pkp-lib, one helper on the locale service,
   `Locale::getIfTranslated($key, $params, $locale)`, that translates
   with the missing-key handler set to return `''` and then restores
   the previous handler, as the email and task template installers do.
   It restores it in a `finally`, which those installers lack, so a
   translation that throws cannot leave the handler set. Every writer of
   defaults calls it instead of `__()`, six calls in four methods:
   `PKPSchemaService::getDefault()` (two),
   `UserGroup\Repository::installLocale()` (two),
   `GenreDAO::installDefaults()` and the contributor roles in
   `PKPContextService::add()`
   ([fix.diff](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/blob/main/shared/playwright/checks/issues/french-default-texts-stored-as-codes/fix.diff)):

   ```diff
   +    public function getIfTranslated(string $key, array $params = [], ?string $locale = null): string
   +    {
   +        $previous = $this->missingKeyHandler;
   +        $this->missingKeyHandler = fn (string $key): string => '';
   +        try {
   +            return $this->get($key, $params, $locale);
   +        } finally {
   +            $this->missingKeyHandler = $previous;
   +        }
   +    }
   …
   -                    return __($propSchema->defaultLocaleKey, $localeParams, $localeKey);
   +                    return Locale::getIfTranslated($propSchema->defaultLocaleKey, $localeParams, $localeKey);
   ```

   An empty text then shows the primary language's text on public pages
   (`LocalizedData::getBestLocalizedData()` skips empty values). The
   Settings pages show the box as empty, which is the truth. A helper
   is chosen over setting the handler at each of the six calls because
   it puts the `finally` in one place.
2. An upgrade migration that repairs saved codes. It scans the context
   settings (`journal_settings`, `press_settings`, `server_settings`)
   for properties with a `defaultLocaleKey`, `user_group_settings`
   (`name`, `abbrev`), `genre_settings` (`name`) and
   `contributor_role_settings` (`name`). A value that is exactly
   `##<its key>##`, or `<p>##<its key>##</p>` after a save in the editor,
   is replaced by the guarded translation: the French text once part 3
   is in, otherwise `''`. The key comes from the property's
   `defaultLocaleKey` for a context setting and from the stored
   `nameLocaleKey` and `abbrevLocaleKey` for a role. File types and
   contributor roles store no key: a file type's is the `localeKey`
   that `registry/genres.xml` gives its `entry_key`, and a contributor
   role's the key `PKPContextService::add()` gives its
   `contributor_role_identifier` (`default.groups.name.author`,
   `default.groups.name.translator`). It writes `''` rather than
   deleting the row, the same value part 1 saves for a new context, and
   the page then shows the primary language's text. Not tried: a
   migration of stored data. Written for `main`; whether 3.5 and 3.4
   take it as an upgrade step of their own (3.5 without the contributor
   roles) is unverified.
3. The French (Canada) texts, entered on Weblate, PKP's route for
   translations. OMP's two texts can start from OMP's French (France)
   file, which has both. OPS's eighteen saved texts (and the two role
   plurals) have no French source, since OPS's
   French (France) file is as empty. The journal's French texts, with
   "revue" made "serveur", are a starting point for the translators.
   Not tried: translators' wording.

Tried on `main`, part 1 alone. After "Reload defaults" and on the new
press and server, the French pages showed the English guidelines,
checklist and privacy statement, and the French submission's checklist
the English one. The server's "Rôles" tab listed "Preprint Server
manager" and "Moderator". The journal's French pages, the English pages
and the journal's saved French texts and role names were the same with
the fix in and out. Steps 1 to 4 still showed the codes saved before the
fix, which part 2 would repair. With part 1 in, "Restaurer les valeurs
par défaut" on the server's components list (step 16) saved the seven
French names empty, and the list showed their English names ("Research
Instrument" … "Source Texts"); the journal's list kept its French names
after the same step. With part 1 in (2026-11-03), the French server of
steps 17 to 22 saved its two roles' French names empty, and the
invitation email named the role "Moderator" in both places; the
journal's and the press's emails, their new contexts' French role
names, the server's translated roles ("Auteur-e", "Lecteur-trice",
"Membre du comité éditorial") and `publicknowledge`'s saved names were
the same with the fix in and out.

**Alternatives**

- Translations alone (part 3): fixes French for presses and servers
  created afterwards, but every other gap still saves a code, and
  existing ones keep theirs.
- Save the primary language's text in the empty language's box: the
  Settings pages would then present English as the French text, and the
  "1/2 languages completed" count would be wrong. The public pages
  already fall back to the primary language when the box is empty.
- Hide `##…##` values when a page shows them: a filter at every reader
  of the data, leaving the saved data wrong.

**What goes with it**

- Left out of part 1: `PKPInstall` names the Site Administrator role per
  language the same way. That key is pkp-lib's own and translated in
  French.
- Backport: 3.5 needs its own diff. It has no contributor roles, so the
  `PKPContextService` hunk has no counterpart, and its
  `GenreDAO::installDefaults()` has no `setSupportsFileVariants()` line,
  so that hunk's context does not match; `git apply --check` rejects
  both, and the other hunks apply with offsets. 3.4 has the same locale
  service with `setMissingKeyHandler()`; its
  `UserGroup\Repository::installLocale()` uses `setData()`, and the
  same helper goes there. 3.3's `PKPLocale` has no
  `setMissingKeyHandler()`, but its `__()` takes the missing-key handler
  as a fourth argument (`PKPLocale::translate()`, by default
  `addOctothorpes()`). The backport passes a handler that returns `''`
  in `PKPSchemaService::getDefault()`, in `UserGroupDAO::installLocale()`
  (which writes through `updateSetting()`) and in the file types;
  checking the answer for `##…##`, as `I10620_EditorialBoardMemberRole`
  does, works as well.
- The guard: a pkp-lib unit test that `PKPSchemaService::getDefault()`
  answers `''` for a key the language lacks, and an e2e check on a new
  press and server with French that the French "Submissions", "Privacy
  Statement" and masthead pages hold no `##` code (a Planned item in
  spec U57).

Medium: a helper and six calls in four pkp-lib methods, an upgrade
migration to repair stored data, and translations in two applications.

  takes steps 1 to 12 on all three apps, the journal as the control,
  reads the English pages as a control, and reads the saved French
  values of each context's three texts and roles. Run it on an install

  Section editor and the press's Series editor the control); it reads
  the email from the install's mail catcher and the new context's saved
  role names (`user_group_settings`). Its address carries the app and
  run (`u07hk3-ops-main@example.org`), since one mail catcher serves
  every install. `MODE=nb` in front runs its neighbour check alone: a
  French-primary context made the same way, its French "Rôles" tab and
  saved role names, and `publicknowledge`'s saved role names.
  On OPS `main`, `INVITE_ROLE='Preprint Server manager'` in front
  invites to the manager role on a server the steps already made (its email names the
  role "##default.groups.name.manager##"), and `ACCEPT=1` opens the
  email's "Accept Invitation" link signed out (it opened "STEP 1 -
  Create OPS account"; the acceptance was not completed). Part 1 was
  tried with
  `node bin/try-fix.js apply …/fix.diff ojs omp ops` (`ojs ops` for the
  components), the scripts, then `revert`; on 2026-11-03 `walk-invite.js`
  with the fix in, its `MODE=nb` check with the fix in and again after
  the revert.
- Walked on `main` and `stable-3_5_0`, on PostgreSQL: steps 1 to 12
  from pkp/datasets c657990 (2026-10-01), steps 13 to 16 from 566bb1f
  (2026-10-03). On 2026-11-03 steps 1 to 12 and 17 to 22 again, from
  pkp/datasets 2fd5c320 (2026-11-02), with the same results for steps 1
  to 12. The database plays no part (locale files and the
  writers); MySQL not checked.
- Tips: `main`: OJS b84f8e2e44 (`lib/pkp` ddd8ab243a), OMP 3b0ecf794c
  and OPS c8af945bb7 (`lib/pkp` 3dc90c81a6); for steps 13 to 16 OJS
  ff004d0973 (`lib/pkp` 987776cd04). `stable-3_5_0`: OJS c346ee00a5
  (`lib/pkp` 3bb4450bea), OMP c7b45f88ea and OPS 8eaf899468 (`lib/pkp`
  1fb843f491); for steps 13 to 16 OJS c1cee76b95 (`lib/pkp`
  771474347e), OMP 9c5e24246c and OPS 38b61882d3 (`lib/pkp`
  cf3f984335). `stable-3_4_0`: OMP 0aec65441, OPS acd8ae704b, `lib/pkp`
  32b0f4b4af. `stable-3_3_0`: OMP 8e72fc883, OPS c5532e2161, `lib/pkp`
  f6ab331645. On 2026-11-03 (steps 1 to 12 and 17 to 22): `main` OJS
  e7ce037799, OMP 828150a8f and OPS 53749f7d2f (`lib/pkp` 1ae711024a in
  all three); `stable-3_5_0` OJS 0f2de4ff3f, OMP 9e2a7fd00 and OPS
  d4a7e97a55 (`lib/pkp` c4c0aa8c52); `stable-3_4_0` `lib/pkp`
  f4719f2805, `stable-3_3_0` `lib/pkp` 5b26595791.
- Code reads: `locale/*/default.po` of the three apps on `main` (the
  language gaps under Cause, each key checked as missing or empty
  against `locale/en`), and pkp-lib's `locale/en` (none of these keys).
  3.5: the same `fr_CA/default.po` files as `main`, and the same writers
  but the contributor roles, which 3.5 does not have; `fix.diff` checked
  with `git apply --check` against 3.5's `lib/pkp` cf3f984335. 3.4:
  OMP's guidelines and checklist empty; OPS's guidelines, checklist,
  privacy statement, role names and file types empty. 3.3: the schema
  has no default guidelines; OMP's privacy statement and four of its
  five checklist items are empty, and OPS's privacy statement,
  checklist items, role names and file types. On every version
  `GenreDAO::installDefaults()` (`.inc.php` on 3.3) translates each
  name with `__()` unguarded, and "Restore Defaults" calls it.
  The invitation email (2026-11-03): 3.5's `UserRoleAssignmentInvite`
  and `UserRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify` read the names as `main`'s do
  (`LocalizedData::getBestLocalizedData()` skips only empty values);
  3.5's `installLocale()` saves the name with `__()` as `main` does, and OPS's `fr_CA/default.po` leaves
  `default.groups.name.sectionEditor` empty on both. 3.4 and 3.3 have no
  role invitation (no `classes/invitation` in their `lib/pkp`), so the
  email adds nothing to their sub-items.
- Introduced: OPS's `locale/fr_CA/default.po` was added on Weblate in
  95cec4d325 with a header only; these entries arrived in it later,
  empty, and were blamed through the 2023 rearrangement of the locale
  files (eb1d961fe7 in OPS, 3bcd14e06c in OMP, both moves). The
  unguarded `__()` in `getDefault()` dates from the schema service
  (blamed to e3f570bc37, 2021-04-20, itself a move). Not traced further.
- Upstream: pkp/pkp-lib, pkp/ops, pkp/omp and pkp/ui-library searched by
  the key names, "missing translation", "untranslated role names",
  "reload defaults", `getDefault`, `setMissingKeyHandler`,
  `default.genres`, "genres untranslated" and `installDefaults`. Read
  and not this fault: `pkp/pkp-lib#3223` (role names in the wrong
  language on 3.1), `pkp/pkp-lib#6467` ("Reload defaults" and
  `$contextPath`), `pkp/pkp-lib#1505` (a translator's question, 2016).
  On 2026-11-03 for the email: `default.groups.name.sectionEditor`,
  "invitation email role name untranslated", "invitation role name
  locale key", `UserRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify` locale, and in
  pkp/ops `default.groups.name` and "moderator french"; the hits
  (`pkp/pkp-lib#13181`, `#11803`, `#12538` among them) are other
  invitation faults.
- Not this fault: after "Save" in step 17 the new context's page asks
  the plugin gallery for its list, which answers 500 on the test
  installs because their `[proxy]` setting leads nowhere.
- Not driven: OPS's file type names in the submission wizard (database
  read only); the role code in other lists, such as a submission's
  participants.
- Unverified: parts 2 and 3 of the fix; whether a context whose primary
  language lacks a role's text would then show an empty role name where
  the site has no other language with that text (`I10620` saves the
  code in that case).
