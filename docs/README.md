# The documentation, and where to start

Everything the e2e campaign knows lives under `docs/`. This page says what
each file is for and who should read it.

## If you want to understand a feature

Read its spec in `docs/specs/`. A spec describes one feature across OJS, OMP
and OPS in product language: who can do what, the rules, the side effects,
the scenarios a tester can act out, and a register of everything that looks
broken or needs a product decision. The one-paragraph legend for the markers
and badges is in `docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md` under "Reading a spec". The rest of
the glossary defines the product vocabulary the specs use and maps OJS terms
to their OMP and OPS names.

## If you want to know what is built and what is next

Tracking files hold what is open; resolved items are deleted and live on
in git history. The parity ledger and app-changes are the exception: they
record changes still in effect; so is regression-metrics, the weekly count's
history.

- `docs/tracking/PROGRESS.md`: one row per feature with its status, test
  counts and a short note; the banner names the mode.
- `docs/tracking/FEATURE-MAP.md`: the 75 features and the screens and
  behaviors each one covers.
- `docs/tracking/ci-triage.md`: known CI failures, flake classes and the
  companion branches waiting on developers' app PRs; check it before
  calling a red build new.
- `docs/tracking/upstream-sync.md`: the last app commits the suite was
  reviewed against.
- `docs/tracking/upstream-sync-stable-3_5_0.md`: the last `stable-3_5_0`
  commits read for regressions (no suite runs on that branch).
- `docs/tracking/upstream-sync-ore.md`: the last `ore` commits read, and
  what the pkp-e2e `ore` branch (the OJS suite for the ORE project's
  production branch, until 3.6 is released) took over from `main`.
- `docs/tracking/app-changes.md`: app defects the tests work around, and
  any app code the campaign changed.
- `docs/tracking/parity-ledger.md`: evidence that the test-data builders
  produce the state a real user would.
- `docs/tracking/incidentals.md`: what a session saw in passing on another
  feature's screens, kept until that spec absorbs it.
- `docs/tracking/regression-metrics.md`: the weekly count of the
  reports in `docs/reports/` (not its subfolders), regressions apart (open, closed, new), with
  where each closed regression went; rows are kept as the history
  (`npm run regressions`).
- `docs/tracking/friction.md`: what made an agent's task harder than it
  needed to be, appended by the agents that drive screens; rows are
  deleted once acted on.
- `docs/tracking/assignments.md`: who on the team takes each open
  GitHub issue, by who introduced it or who knows that code best; a
  first version to iterate on.
- `docs/tracking/UNASSIGNED.md` and `docs/tracking/atlas/`: the inventory
  of every screen and action in the apps, and the leftovers no spec claims.
- `docs/reports/`: regression and defect write-ups handed to the team,
  deleted once acted on. `docs/reports/pr-review/` holds the ones found
  in PRs not merged yet, until the merge deletes them or moves them up;
  `docs/reports/ore/` the ones only `ore` shows.
- `docs/issues/`: the specs' defects written up for the team, one file
  per GitHub issue on pkp-e2e, kept in step with its register entries
  and deleted when the issue closes (a developer who takes one on copies
  it to pkp, and the issue closes once that copy is resolved and the
  fix shows on `main`). `npm run backlog` lists everything the
  housekeeping session still has to work, reports owed included.

## If you are building specs and tests

Read in this order:

1. `docs/process/RUNBOOK.md`: what the project is trying to achieve, how a
   feature moves from nothing to a verified spec with green tests, and where
   each kind of finding goes. `docs/process/briefs/` holds the brief
   template for each subagent role plus the shared Frame (`frame.md`) and
   digest block (`digest-block.md`); the orchestrator fills the slots.
2. `docs/process/TEMPLATE.md`: how a spec is written, section by section;
   `docs/process/REPORT.md`: how a regression or defect report, or a
   GitHub issue, handed to the team is written, and the severity and effort scales.
3. `docs/process/PRINCIPLES.md`: the rules every test follows.
4. `docs/process/harness.md`: how the Playwright harness is laid out and run.
   Then `patterns.md` (conventions and pitfalls), `scenarios.md` (seeding
   test data and asserting on email) and `users.md` (the seeded accounts).

- `docs/process/dataset.md`: PKP's default test dataset (the install the
  team has), per app: the context, every user with their roles and every
  submission with its stage and people; an issue report's steps start
  from it, walked on a dataset fleet (harness.md "Dataset fleets").
- `docs/process/seed-facts.md`: what a fresh test install contains and how
  it is configured; check a probe premise against it before writing the
  question. Its generated part is kept true by `npm run seed-facts -- --check`.

`docs/process/MAINTENANCE.md` is for the resident QA agent: keeping the
suite in step with the moving apps, helping a developer whose PR fails the
suite, answering coverage requests, and talking to the team on Mattermost.
