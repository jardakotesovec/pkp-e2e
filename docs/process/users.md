# Users & Roles Reference

Everything about signing in: which user to log in as, what the passwords
are, how login caching works, and what the seeded journal contains. The
harness files named here exist and match this text.

Display names read "Firstname Role" (`admin` is "Site Admin"). Emails are
`<username>@mail.test`.

**Three different role vocabularies appear in this work. Don't mix them.**

1. **PHP role constants** (`ROLE_ID_*` in
   `lib/pkp/classes/security/Role.php`). This is what the backend checks.
2. **Scenario role keys** (`users[].roles` in scenario POSTs). The seeder
   (`UserSeeder::resolveUserGroup()`) matches them against the app's default
   user groups.
3. **Roster labels** (the "Role" column below). Informal names for the
   seeded accounts.

## 1. PHP role constants

| Constant | ID | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN` | 1 | Site-wide. The group has a null context id |
| `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` | 16 | Journal manager: settings, users, plugins |
| `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR` | 17 | Editor / section editor |
| `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT` | 4097 | Copyeditor, layout editor, proofreader, funding coordinator, editorial board member |
| `ROLE_ID_REVIEWER` | 4096 | Peer reviewer |
| `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` | 65536 | Author (also granted implicitly on submit) |
| `ROLE_ID_READER` | 1048576 | Any registered user |
| `ROLE_ID_SUBSCRIPTION_MANAGER` | 2097152 | OJS only. Not seeded in the roster |

## 2. Scenario role keys (per app)

Each app accepts only the keys of the user groups it ships. An unknown key
gets a 400 response that lists the whole set. That error is the cheapest way
to re-check these lists.

| App | Keys |
|---|---|
| OJS | `manager`, `editor`, `productionEditor`, `sectionEditor`, `guestEditor`, `copyeditor`, `designer`, `funding`, `indexer`, `layoutEditor`, `marketing`, `proofreader`, `author`, `translator`, `externalReviewer`, `reader`, `subscriptionManager`, `editorialBoardMember` |
| OMP | The OJS list without `guestEditor` and `subscriptionManager`, plus `volumeEditor`, `chapterAuthor`, `internalReviewer` |
| OPS | `manager`, `sectionEditor`, `author`, `reader`, `editorialBoardMember` only. No `funding`, no reviewer keys, no production assistants |

Traps:

- **There is no `reviewer` key.** Use `externalReviewer` (OMP also has
  `internalReviewer`).
- **`editor` is a manager-level role, not a sub-editor.** On the default user
  groups of a scratch journal, `editor` resolves to "Journal editor", which
  carries `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` (see `registry/userGroups.xml`). A throwaway
  user seeded with `roles: ['editor']` therefore passes manager-level gates
  such as canPublish and settings access. For a non-manager editorial role,
  use `sectionEditor`.
- **The site administrator has no scenario key.** The installer's `admin` is
  the only administrator. Keep it enabled and never merge it: every suite
  depends on it.
- **Screens show the app's own label.** `sectionEditor` appears as "Section
  editor" in OJS, "Series editor" in OMP and "Moderator" in OPS.

## 3. The seeded roster

Home: `shared/playwright/data/users.js`. All 18 users are enrolled in
`publicknowledge`. `admin` is site-level and created by the installer. The
other 17 are created by the bootstrap seed. Usernames follow the pattern
`role.firstname`, with one account per permission archetype. **Use the first
listed account for a role** unless the test needs a specific property.

OMP and OPS enrol only a subset of the roster. See `harness.md` for the
per-app differences.

| Username | Roster label | Use when you need… |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | site admin | Admin console, multi-journal operations, plugins |
| `manager.maya` | manager | Journal settings, managing users |
| `editor.diana` | editor | A senior editor (also a section editor of both sections) |
| `sectioneditor.ana` | sectionEditor | Section editor for Articles (`ART`). The default pick |
| `sectioneditor.ravi` | sectionEditor | Section editor for Reviews (`REV`) |
| `sectioneditor.omar` | sectionEditor | Another Articles section editor. The designated account for recommend-only assignments (the flag itself is set per assignment) |
| `reviewer.julia` | reviewer | The default reviewer |
| `reviewer.paul` | reviewer | A second reviewer |
| `reviewer.amara` | reviewer | A third reviewer (Internal on OMP) |
| `reviewer.adam` | reviewer | A fourth reviewer (Internal on OMP) |
| `copyeditor.carla` | copyeditor | Copyediting actions |
| `copyeditor.sam` | copyeditor | A second copyeditor |
| `layouteditor.leo` | layoutEditor | Layout / galley production |
| `proofreader.pia` | proofreader | Proofreading actions |
| `author.alex` | author | A non-privileged author, for author-only permission gates |
| `author.bea` | author | A second author, for co-author and foreign-submission cases |
| `assistant.rita` | assistant | OJS/OMP: Funding coordinator, the one default assistant group WITH review-stage access (stages 1 and 3). OPS: Editorial Board Member, with NO stage access |
| `reader.rosa` | reader | A registered user with no role beyond reader |

**Why `author.alex` matters.** Every other seeded user with workflow access
also holds a manager or editor role, and those roles short-circuit
`canEditPublication`. Only the two author-only accounts make author-side
permission tests meaningful.

There is no pre-seeded subscription manager (an OJS-only role).
`reader.rosa` covers the plain-reader case.

## Password rule

`getPassword()` in `users.js`: `admin` has the password `admin`. Everyone
else has their username repeated twice (`editor.diana` becomes
`editor.dianaeditor.diana`). No seeded account is flagged
`mustChangePassword`.

**Maxlength trap.** The login form's password input carries
`maxlength="32"`, and the `sectioneditor.*` passwords are longer than that.
`LoginPage.fillPassword()` removes the attribute before filling, so tests
never hit the limit. The limit itself is a product finding, not something to
work around in tests.

## Login flow internals

`ensureAuthStateFor(browser, username, {baseURL})` in
`shared/playwright/support/auth.js`:

1. If `apps/<app>/playwright/.auth/<username>.json` exists, **probe** it.
   The probe replays the cookies and requests the profile URL, following
   redirects. The cached state is live when the request ends with a 200
   outside `/login` (`ok() && !url.includes('/login')`). A probe with
   redirects disabled cannot work here: even a signed-in profile request
   redirects twice (first to the locale prefix, then into the context).
2. Otherwise perform a real UI login at `/index.php/index/en/login`, using
   the stable ids `input#username`, `input#password` and
   `form#login button`. Wait for the redirect away from `/login`
   (`waitUntil: 'commit'`), then save `storageState()` to the file.
3. Two workers may race on a missing or stale file. Both log in, which is
   allowed (concurrent sessions are permitted), and the last write wins.
   The file is written atomically (temp file, then rename), so a reader
   never sees a half-written file.

**Why the probe exists.** Impersonation flows (`signInAs`/`signOutAs`)
migrate the session id and destroy the previous session row, which strands
the cached cookies. The probe catches that without special-casing those
tests.

How tests use it: `test.use({user: 'editor.diana'})` sets the file's default
identity (the `storageState` fixture in `base-test.js` wires it up).
`asUser()` opens extra authenticated contexts for additional actors.

## Bootstrap prerequisite

Auth only works after the setup project has run. It probes
`GET /api/v1/_test/bootstrap?context=publicknowledge`. When the install is
warm, that is a no-op. When it is cold, it runs `tools/installTest.php`,
which installs the schema on an empty DB, drops all tables and reinstalls
when it finds leftover install debris, and refuses any DB whose name lacks
"test". It then seeds `publicknowledge` and the 17 non-admin users from
`apps/<app>/playwright/fixtures/bootstrap.js`.

Stale `.auth/` files are recreated on demand. `npm run reset:<app>` forces a
full cold bootstrap.

## The `publicknowledge` context

Path `publicknowledge`, base URL `/index.php/publicknowledge/`, primary
locale `en` (supported: `en`, `fr_CA`), acronym `JPK`.

| Reviews | `REV` | editor.diana, sectioneditor.ravi | Abstracts not required |

Categories: `applied-science` (children `comp-sci/computer-vision` and

Issues: Vol 1 No 2 (2014) is **published**. Vol 2 No 1 (2015) is

targets a back issue.
