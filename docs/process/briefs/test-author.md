You are the test author for the **{{APP}}** suite of feature {{feature}} "{{feature_name}}" in the pkp-e2e campaign (repo root: {{repo_root}}; all paths relative to it). Follow RUNBOOK step 8 and "The multi-app rules". Read `docs/process/PRINCIPLES.md`, `docs/process/harness.md`, `docs/process/patterns.md`, `docs/process/scenarios.md`, `docs/process/seed-facts.md`, `docs/process/users.md`, the spec, and the feature's `screen-notes.md`.

The spec is `{{spec_path}}`; read its body and only the footnotes your scenarios cite, not the whole file. Scenarios this app runs: {{scenarios}}. Feature facts for step 8: {{feature_facts}}.

Situation: {{situation}}

Deliverables:
1. `{{suite_path}}`, in the shape of {{example_suites}}, following PRINCIPLES: one test per scenario, its title opening with the scenario number (`S3: …`). Every absence a scenario states ("nothing else", "no list", "stays") is asserted with a settled, auto-waited read and a positive control, never left unasserted (PRINCIPLES M6); a contradiction is a finding under deliverable 4, not a dropped assertion. In a revision, extend the existing suite: a test per scenario added, an assertion per bullet added to a scenario already tested, every title opening `S<n>` (the legacy `scenario <n>` titles renamed, existing numbers kept), the header's "not covered" block cut to the register IDs (the spec's Coverage section is the record of the rest); `node docs/process/lint/lint-spec.mjs --tests {{spec_path}}` reports zero for this app before you return.
2. Page objects: {{page_objects}}.
3. Run the suite green once against the live fleet: `npx playwright test -c configs/{{app}}.config.js {{suite_path}} --output {{output_dir}} --reporter=list` (harness.md says how the config starts its worker servers). A serial spec runs alone with `--project={{app}}-serial --no-deps` on a warm install; never run a whole project, and keep every run under about four minutes (harness.md "Running"). Save the green run's log as `{{green_log}}`.
4. A test that contradicts the spec is returned as step 8 says: a digest block in the shape of `docs/process/briefs/digest-block.md` (ID `T-{{app}}-<n>`; Evidence: the run-log pointer and the screenshot) in `{{findings_path}}`. The run is the evidence the fold uses; nothing is re-driven, so the block quotes what the screen showed. Never edit a test to pass a claim the app disproves. An app defect that blocks green is worked around and returned as a proposed `app-changes.md` row.
5. A scenario whose setting or state has no scenario key is returned as a harness need (RUNBOOK step 4), never driven through a settings screen in the test.

Read `.reports/{{feature}}/screen-notes.md` first and append what you learn by hand, in the kit's one-line shape prefixed with your agent id (a test never imports the kit); grep the sibling `screen-locators.md` for a locator another agent found, and the kept check scripts under `shared/playwright/checks/{{feature}}/` for the screen you are on (grep them, never read one whole). Fleet ports and probe-server URLs are in `{{fleet_json}}`; never start a server; the probe servers are running.

Any throwaway check you drive by hand uses the probe kit with `PROBE_FEATURE={{feature}} PROBE_AGENT={{agent}}`; tests never import the kit.

Do NOT write to PROGRESS.md or docs/tracking/app-changes.md; return proposed content in your report instead. Never edit the spec, PRINCIPLES or the harness docs. Never edit anything under `checkouts/`. Commit nothing. Kill only browser or PHP processes you started yourself. If anything in this task cost you calls, time or retries that a better brief, doc, kit, seed or fixture would have saved, append one line to `docs/tracking/friction.md` in its shape before you return.

Return (short): the suite path and test count; the page-object path(s) and public method names; the green-run log path and its summary line; the findings file (block count, or none); harness needs (missing passthrough key families, or none); anything that blocked you; the security routing count.
