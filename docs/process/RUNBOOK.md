# Runbook: how a feature gets its spec and its tests

**Goal.** Accurate specs a QA person or product owner can read without a
developer, and per-app Playwright tests derived from them with strong
coverage, for OJS, OMP and OPS (one FEATURE-MAP row per feature, anchored on
OJS). Every claim is driven on the screens before it ships, every spec gets
one readability pass, every suite runs green twice, and anything
security-shaped is quarantined in the maintainer's private file. When a rule
gets in the way of that, the rule changes.

This file and `docs/tracking/PROGRESS.md` are the source of truth; a session
becomes correct by reading them, never by memory. The PROGRESS banner names
the mode: REVIEW (one feature per session, then stop) or MAINTENANCE
(`MAINTENANCE.md`, with this loop binding underneath). Paths are relative to
the repo root; `../e2e_ng/` is the maintainer's private directory.

## The loop

Each role's rules live in its brief template, `docs/process/briefs/<role>.md`;
the orchestrator renders briefs from them (`briefs/README.md`), judges
results, and alone writes PROGRESS rows and `app-changes.md`. Every agent that
drives screens opens with the Frame (`briefs/frame.md`): QA of the apps' own
screens as a signed-in role on a disposable install, never a request the
screens would not send; where what a screen offers and what happens disagree,
that disagreement is the deliverable. A feature session does the feature and
nothing else. Every step ends in a file, and `.reports/<feature>/phase-status.md`
gets one line per gate passed (`<gate> · <date> · <file>`), appended by the
orchestrator.

1. **Claim.** Set the feature's PROGRESS row to `in_progress`. Gate: the row.
2. **Fleet prep.** `npm run fleet-prep -- --feature U<nn> [--reset]`.
   Gate: `.reports/<feature>/fleet.json`.
3. **Draft.** A spec author writes `docs/specs/U<nn>-<feature>.md` per
   TEMPLATE, all three apps from the start, Coverage rows classed and
   `planned`, no scenarios, open questions as `to drive:` footnotes
   (`briefs/spec-author.md`). The orchestrator writes the scenario count
   next to the tier in the PROGRESS row from the author's class counts
   ("Budget"). Gate: the spec, lint zero, the PROGRESS row.
4. **Harness.** Only when the author's return names a scenario key
   `scenarios.md` lacks: a harness agent builds it with its parity row and
   re-runs the shipped suites that seed through it (`briefs/harness.md`); a
   test author who meets a missing key at step 8 sends the loop back here.
   Gate: `.reports/<feature>/harness/report.md`.
5. **Claim check.** `npm run seed-facts -- --check` to zero, then
   `node docs/process/lint/lint-spec.mjs --claims <spec>` into
   `.reports/<feature>/claims.txt`. The orchestrator cuts `claims.txt` into
   screen clusters seeded from the spec's surfaces table
   (`claimcheck-chunks.md`); fresh checkers drive every line
   (`briefs/claim-check.md`); with three or more chunks a merge agent writes
   `claimcheck-merge.md` (`briefs/merge.md`), with two or fewer the fold reads
   the chunk reports directly; a fold agent folds the change list into the
   spec (`briefs/fold.md`). Gate: `claims.txt`, `fold-log.md`, lint zero,
   `claims.txt` regenerated.
6. **Scenarios.** A fresh writer spends the tier by the Coverage classes,
   composes the canonical scenarios from the verified body, and turns the
   Coverage table into the "Left out" list after them
   (`briefs/scenario-writer.md`). Gate: scenarios in the spec, the
   Coverage table gone, lint zero.
7. **Readability.** One persona read of the body (`briefs/persona.md`), then
   one rewrite of the wording blockers (`briefs/rewrite.md`); no second read,
   no other persona anywhere in the feature. Gate: `persona.md`, lint zero.
8. **Tests.** One test author per app writes the suite and runs it green once
   (`briefs/test-author.md`); one fold agent folds the runs' findings, with
   `Basis: test run` on new entries (`briefs/fold.md`); then
   `npm run test:final -- --feature U<nn>` is the second green, re-run after
   any fix. Gate: `test-<app>-green.log`, `final-run-<app>.log`.
9. **Progress.** The orchestrator sets the frontmatter to `status: verified`
   (its one inline spec edit) and replaces the PROGRESS row: status, tests
   per app, and a note in the fixed shape (tests per app · register counts ·
   one headliner ID · budget cuts as states / variants · open blocker ·
   low-confidence IDs). Gate: the row, lint zero after the flip.
10. **Commit.** One commit in this repo, everything the campaign produced;
    `.reports/` never (session scratch, gitignored, deletable after review;
    the kept checks under `shared/playwright/checks/` are the exception).
    App checkouts are read-only: pkp push URLs are disabled by construction,
    app changes go through maintainer-reviewed PRs, a bad push gets a
    follow-up commit, never a force-push. Gate: the commit.
11. **Report.** What was built, the register highlights, anything
    low-confidence; if anything was routed to the private file, the
    verification probe (`briefs/security-verify.md`) has run and the report
    gives counts only. Then stop; the next feature starts in a fresh session.
    Gate: `security · <date> · none | routed, see private file` in phase-status.

## What goes where

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Product findings: bugs, divergences, open questions, API misbehavior the browser's own traffic showed with no security dimension | the spec's Findings register; nowhere else (not `app-changes.md`, not a PROGRESS note) |
| A potential security concern | `../e2e_ng/security.md`, private and outside every repo; verified by one targeted probe before the session report; rules and entry shape in `briefs/security-verify.md`. The fact of routing is always stated; the content never appears in a spec, test, `.reports/` file, PROGRESS note or commit |
| A finding against an unmerged PR | the developer; the spec describes `main` (MAINTENANCE "A developer's PR fails the suite") |
| What a probe saw on another feature's screen | `docs/tracking/incidentals.md`, one line, written by the orchestrator from the fold log and the merge |
| Process friction | `docs/tracking/friction.md`, one line, appended by the screen-driving agent itself |
| Build blockers and any app-code change | `docs/tracking/app-changes.md`, orchestrator only |
| Builder parity | `docs/tracking/parity-ledger.md` |
| A write-up for the team | `docs/reports/`, deleted once acted on; the register footnote keeps the pointer |
| Process learnings | this file, TEMPLATE, PRINCIPLES or a brief template, through maintainer review; never a spec |
| Anything resolved | deleted; git keeps it. Tracking files hold what is open, and anything outside its canonical home is one sentence plus a link |

## Budget

Per app about 700 tests and 25 minutes for the full suite on a fresh
database; the measured sizes and times are in the PROGRESS banner, kept
current by the maintenance session. CI runs one job per app with four
workers and no sharding yet: a suite that grows past the cap gets a shard
matrix in `run-app.yml`, never a cut. A feature's scenario count is
everything important plus a fixed extra. The important half, the main
and guard rows of the spec's classed Coverage table (TEMPLATE
"Coverage"), is always covered, however many there are, so a complex
feature grows by itself and stays one spec. The extra is the tier, set
by the feature's importance in FEATURE-MAP: H buys about 6–8 further
scenarios for state rows, M 3–4, L 1–2. At step 3 the orchestrator
writes the resulting count next to the tier in the PROGRESS row (`H ·
15`) from the spec author's class counts. The scenario writer spends the
extra on the most used states first, and what it does not reach is
written under the section's "Budget" bullet, never dropped silently,
where the maintainer can pull any item back in.

## The multi-app rules

Test files cite these by number, so the numbers are stable.

1. **One spec, all three apps.** No per-app copies. An unmarked claim asserts
   "verified identical in every app that has the surface": for a shared code
   path the subclass-chain check (rule 8) is the evidence; for permissions,
   exclusivity or what a screen offers, additionally a live cross-app probe
   (rule 4); anything else is probed or gets a marker. Divergences carry an
   inline marker to the register; an absent feature gets a title badge such
   as `{OJS OMP}` and one absence paragraph written as an install fact.
2. **Scenarios live in the spec, common ones first,** then the app-specific
   ones; a per-app difference inside a common scenario is marked inline, and
   a scenario an app cannot run names its analogue or absence. A scenario
   added to a shipped spec goes last; the earlier numbers never move
   ("Revising a shipped feature").
3. **Tests are written per app, derived from the spec.** Each suite covers
   the common scenarios in its app's own context plus its app-specific ones;
   duplication between suites is fine. Never assert a 🐞 finding as the
   contract; a claim parked on an open ❓ is not a coverage gap; an absent
   feature costs one absence test with a positive control per assertion;
   each suite's file header says what it deliberately does not cover.
4. **Probing is cross-app by construction.** Every exclusivity claim ("only X
   can", "never shows") gets a read-only control probe in the other apps, and
   a probe item that spans apps is owned by one agent driving all fleets.
5. **Corrections to the OJS text are expected.** A finding that touches
   shared text is re-checked on OJS before the spec is final.
6. **Age guides the verdict.** Behavior untouched since the app's early years
   reads as intent; behavior that broke in a modernization window reads as
   decay. The verdict is the register badge plus one sentence; the
   archaeology stays in footnotes.
7. **Divergence or own feature?** Different parameters on existing machinery
   stay a register divergence; a difference that needs rules of its own
   (screens no spec claims, replacement scenarios) earns its own FEATURE-MAP
   row. Forked-copy code with identical logic is one feature, but every
   shared claim there needs probe evidence. OMP/OPS-only surfaces stay out of
   scope until the maintainer extends it. Size alone never splits a
   feature: a complex feature stays one spec and its tier grows
   ("Budget").
8. **Look in the class hierarchy first.** For a load-bearing lib/pkp class
   read each app's subclass chain: an empty subclass is positive evidence of
   shared behavior, an override is intended divergence, a missing override
   is the classic silent one. `isOJS()`-style branches, registry and seed
   files and config-merge survivors are the secondary seams.

## Model discipline

- Fable runs every role; subagents inherit the session model; `/model` is
  checked at session start.
- A refusal, safeguard flag or downgrade: discard the attempt, never
  re-press, reword or respawn onto another model; record the gate reached in
  the PROGRESS note and stop for maintainer review. A technical stall is not
  a flag: respawn on a narrower slice, at most twice.
- The orchestrator never probes, verifies or edits a spec inline (the
  `status:` flip excepted); agents that drive screens are always fresh, one
  or two at a time, cut for about 40 browser calls each (an agent still
  finishes its chunk past that).
- Returns are pointers and counts, never findings; the orchestrator judges
  by files (`ls`, `wc -l`, `grep -c`), reads only what must be judged, and
  runs no explore or plan agents during a feature. Between gates the files
  under `.reports/<feature>/` are the status.
- When context runs low, or two launches in a row fail: finish the gate,
  commit what is commit-worthy, end; a fresh session resumes.

## Definition of done

Per feature: the spec is `verified` and lint-clean, all three apps are
covered per the multi-app rules, each suite is green twice, the PROGRESS row
is updated, everything is committed; team review of verdicts is never a gate.
Campaign: the unclaimed atom count in FEATURE-MAP is zero, every PROGRESS row
is `done` or `parked`, each app's suite is within budget.

## Resuming a feature mid-flight

When PROGRESS shows `in_progress` and the tree holds uncommitted work, read
`phase-status.md`, check the files it names exist, and re-run the first gate
whose file is missing. Only files count; a mid-feature commit's PROGRESS
note names the last gate reached.

## Revising a shipped feature

A spec shipped before a rule changed is brought up to it in a session of
its own, launched by the maintainer like a feature session (the
maintenance session never builds), one feature at a time, H tiers first.
The body stays verified, so there is no draft and no claim check. The
queue is `docs/tracking/coverage-revision.md`, one row per spec still to
revise; the spec's classed Coverage table, in TEMPLATE's draft shape, is
`docs/tracking/coverage-revision/U<nn>.md`: `S<n>` in "Runs in" where a
scenario already covers the row, `planned` where none does, and under the
table the plan for each gap (rides in `S<n>`, a scenario of its own, or
no seed) and the suite mismatches `lint-spec.mjs --tests` reports. The
table is the spend: the extra counts the states the existing scenarios
already cover, so a spec past its extra gains guards only and its other
states stay under "Budget", where the maintainer can pull one back.

1. **Claim and fleet prep** as steps 1 and 2.
2. **Scenarios.** A scenario writer (`briefs/scenario-writer.md`, situation
   "revision") spends the classed table by class: reshapes the existing
   scenarios into TEMPLATE's shape sentence for sentence, adds a bullet to
   the scenario a gap rides in, appends a scenario for each gap that needs
   one (numbers never move: the suites' `S<n>` titles and the PROGRESS
   notes cite them), strips the coverage sentences ("scenario 9 runs the
   on end", "no scenario because…") from the "Settings that modify
   behavior" bullets so the section holds facts only, settles
   every test without a scenario and every scenario without a test the
   queue file lists (the scenario becomes a "Left out" item with its
   reason, or the test's behavior gets a scenario when the body states
   it), and writes the "Left out" list. A state with no scenario key goes
   to step 4 or under "No seed". Gate: lint zero.
3. **Readability** as step 7, the persona reading the changed and new
   scenarios only.
4. **Tests.** One test author per app (`briefs/test-author.md`, situation
   "revision") extends the suite: a test per new scenario, an assertion
   per bullet added to a scenario already tested, every title opening
   `S<n>`, the header's "not covered" block cut to register IDs; then the
   fold and `test:final` as step 8. Gate: the green logs,
   `node docs/process/lint/lint-spec.mjs --tests <spec>` zero.
5. **Progress, commit, report** as steps 9 to 11: the PROGRESS row in the
   fixed shape with the scenario count beside the tier; the feature's
   file under `coverage-revision/` and its queue row deleted.
