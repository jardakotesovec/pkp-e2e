# UNASSIGNED — parked atoms & dead-code candidates

Atlas atoms no feature claims, parked here so every atom has exactly one
owner; the campaign is done when every entry is claimed by a spec,
confirmed dead (it stays here with its evidence) or ruled out of scope.
The housekeeping session works one entry a quiet morning, top first
(MAINTENANCE "The housekeeping session").

Sources (removed from the tip 2026-08-25, reachable in git history): the six crosswalks in `.reports/phase0-feature-map/` (their UNASSIGNED
lists, consistent with `synthesis.md` §4) + `RULINGS.md`'s probe-derived
dead-code additions. **29 parked atoms** + **50 noted dead-code/defect
candidates attached to claimed atoms**. (PLUG-028 moved to FEATURE-MAP's
Out-of-scope tail — see RULINGS.md. Two candidates that rested solely on
scratched pre-reset evidence were dropped 2026-08-21 per the reset doctrine —
if real, their specs' own probes will resurface them.)

## Parked atoms (29)

### AFFW-701, AFFW-703, AFFW-704 — legacy author-dashboard round surfaces
- What: the old author-dashboard templates' editor-message link, author
  reviewer grid, and review attachments + revisions grids (FEATURE-MAP had
  them under U26).
- Why parked: dead — the legacy author-dashboard round panel is unreachable
  (its URLs answer 404; the current author round view is the shared workflow
  screen, per the review-stage spec's retired-legacy-surfaces footnote.
  AFFW-702's email-modal body remains live via the Notifications panel and
  stays claimed by U26).
- Evidence (housekeeping, U26 claim check UA1, live drive 2026-10-12, OJS,
  OMP and OPS `main`, two runs each): `authorDashboard/reviewRoundInfo`
  answers a bare "404 Not Found" in every form it is typed and for every
  role, on a submission with a round, a decision letter and a revised
  file; the author's round view (each round, external and internal, open
  and anonymous review) holds none of the three templates' elements and no
  legacy grid; its "Notifications" list is the Vue one, and only the letter
  window's body (AFFW-702) comes from the old handler. Rerun:
  `shared/playwright/checks/U26/UA1/ua1.js`.
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).

### GRID-011, GRID-024 — legacy author review-attachment / revisions grids
- What: author-view grids for review attachments and uploaded revision files,
  mounted only from the retired author-dashboard round panel (AFFW-703/704).
- Why parked: unmounted — no reachable screen loads them in the current UI
  (same evidence as above; the open-review attachment grid GRID-010 is
  live inside the read-review sheet and stays claimed), though each grid's
  own address still answers when typed.
- Evidence (the same drive, 2026-10-12): no request of the reviewer's,
  editor's or author's review-stage screens names either grid; typed with
  the submission, stage and round, each address still answers the
  submission's Author with the grid and that round's files, and refuses
  an Author of another submission, a reviewer and a signed-out visitor;
  nothing it lists is withheld from that role by the screens (*Review
  stage & rounds*, footnote o). Rerun:
  `shared/playwright/checks/U26/UA1/ua1.js`.
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates; the
  two handlers still serve, so removal takes their routes too).

### AFFW-076 — sectionPolicy.tpl section-policy block
- What: OJS template block that wraps a section's policy text under a
  "Section Policy" heading (it offers no start of a submission itself);
  marked deprecated 3.4 — the current Start Submission is the Vue form.
- Why parked: dead — nothing includes it and no screen shows it.
- Evidence (U17 spec author, code read 2026-09-25, ojs `d9b567efec`): no
  template, handler, Vue component or JS file of OJS or its lib/pkp names
  `sectionPolicy.tpl`; its only reference is its own header. The live
  start form shows the section policy through `StartSubmission`'s
  `FieldHTML` instead (the Sections spec, Rule 11).
- Evidence (housekeeping, U17 check UA1, live drive 2026-10-14, OJS `main`,
  two runs; OMP and OPS as controls): About › Submissions, "Make a
  Submission" (before a pick and with each section picked), the page the
  per-section link opens, the issue page and the archive, each as a
  signed-out visitor, an Author and a Journal Manager, on a journal with a
  section that has a policy and one that has none: the template's markup
  (`.section-policy`, `section-id-`) and its "Section Policy" heading never
  appear. The only start offer beside a policy is the signed-in "Make a new
  submission to the … section." link on About › Submissions (OJS, OPS),
  already the Sections spec's A1. Rerun:
  `shared/playwright/checks/U17/UA1/ua1.js`.
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidate).

### AFFM-170 — OMP statisticsSettingsForm.tpl
- What: OMP-only settings template that posts to an op no PHP handler declares.
- Why parked: dead-code candidate — the post target does not exist.
- Resolves: Phase-1 probe (does the page render/submit at all?); if dead, stays
  here as confirmed; if live, claim in U64.
- Evidence (U64 spec author, code read 2026-09-27, omp `72a01a026`;
  re-read and driven 2026-10-20, U64 UA1, omp `5777025be`, lib/pkp
  `042726ebf6`, OJS and OPS as controls, two runs each): no template,
  handler, Vue component or JS file of OMP or its lib/pkp names
  `statisticsSettingsForm.tpl`; its only reference is its own header
  (last commit 2021-01-29, copyright dates). pkp-lib `35595503c9`
  (2020-11-30, pkp/pkp-lib#6145) removed the Tools `statistics` page that
  included it, `saveStatisticsSettings()`, the `statistics` op and role
  assignment and `core:statistics/defaultMetricTypeFormElements.tpl`,
  which the form still includes; the template and the apps' `case
  'statistics'` routing in `pages/management/index.php` were left. On
  screen, no management, statistics or administration page (every tab
  pressed, as a Press Manager and as `admin`) holds the form, a form
  posting to `tools/saveStatisticsSettings` or the string at all. Typed,
  `…/management/tools/saveStatisticsSettings` answers what any unknown
  `tools/` word answers: a blank page, 200, to the Press Manager, the
  Press editor and `admin` (assertions off; U63 A19), the access-denied
  page to the Series Editor, Author and Reader, the Login page signed
  out. `…/management/statistics` answers a bare "404 Not Found" to every
  role and signed out, as an unknown management op does, on all three
  apps. The live statistics settings are the Vue tabs Settings ›
  Distribution › "Statistics" and Administration › Site Settings ›
  "Site Setup" › "Statistics" (U64 Rules 26–27). Dead code (screen and
  code agree); resolves on maintainer confirmation as a removal
  candidate, the template and the `statistics` routing line together.
  Snapshots: `.reports/U64/ccUA1/` (`ua1-typed-*`, `ua1-ctrl-*`,
  `ua1-crawl-*`, `ua1-tabs-*`); kept script
  `shared/playwright/checks/U64/UA1/ua1.js`.

### NOTIF-011 — NOTIFICATION_TYPE_PLUGIN_BASE
- What: plugin-type base offset constant.
- Why parked: zero references outside its definition — nothing to specify.
- Resolves: maintainer ruling to confirm dead (grep evidence already in
  synthesis §4); no probe needed.

### ROUTE-043 — OJS legacy `manager` dispatcher stub
- What: legacy page-handler switch that returns no handler for any op.
- Why parked: dead routing stub, no reachable behavior.
- Evidence (housekeeping, U51 check UA1, live drive 2026-10-29, OJS
  `main` and `stable-3_5_0`, two runs each; OMP and OPS as controls):
  `/manager`, `/manager/index`, each of the nine ops the switch lists and
  an unknown op answer the router's bare "404 Not Found" (HTTP 404) to a
  signed-out visitor, a Reader, the Journal Manager and `admin`, with no
  server log line; OMP and OPS answer the same to
  `/manager/subscriptionTypes`. The `switch` sets no handler, so
  `PKPPageRouter::route()` throws `NotFoundHttpException`; the file was
  left over by ojs `ac405a910f` (2023). Rerun:
  `shared/playwright/checks/U51/UA1/ua1.js`.
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (candidate for removal).

### VUE-004 — ExamplePage
- What: ui-library docs example fixture.
- Why parked: no app mount; not product behavior.
- Resolves: none needed — remains here as a permanent non-product atom unless
  the atlas convention adds a "fixture" marking.

### VUE-042 — NavigationMenuManager component
- What: Vue manager component for navigation menus.
- Why parked: unmounted in any app; only its form modal (VUE-066, claimed by
  U08) is wired.
- Resolves: settled at U08 spec time (2026-09-23): no `NavigationMenuManager.vue`
  exists in any app's ui-library (ojs 2034439a, omp 977e460c, ops 5d138aa9);
  `managers/NavigationMenuManager/` holds only the form modal (VUE-066, claimed
  by U08, opened from the legacy grid), its field, its composable and stories.
  Confirmed dead atlas row; retire candidate.

### API-030 — open-peer-review data API (+ unmounted display components)
- What: OJS-mounted API whose display components (`PkpCite`, `PkpOpenReview`,
  `PkpOrcidDisplay` — recorded in `atlas/affordances-reader.md`'s boundary
  notes, no atom IDs) grep to no mount.
- Why parked: emerging surface with no reachable UI.
- Resolves: Phase-1 liveness probe; if a UI exists, likely U13/U26 territory;
  else stays parked as pre-release machinery.

### API-062 — OMP `publicationPeerReviews` entry point
- What: API mount instantiating a controller class absent from lib/pkp at the
  swept SHA.
- Why parked: dangling mount (confirmed by task ruling in the crosswalk).
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code / upstream sync artifact.

### API-066 — OPS legacy non-versioned `api/genres/` entry
- What: legacy alias mount outside `/v1/`.
- Why parked: dead-code candidate pending liveness.
- Resolves: Phase-1 probe (does the alias respond?); if live, claim as a U58
  reference row.

### JOB-001 — abstract queued-job base class
- What: framework base, no feature-visible behavior.
- Why parked: nothing to specify.
- Resolves: none needed — permanent infra atom (mirrors the Q5 infra logic at
  job level).

### JOB-028, JOB-029 — TestJobFailure / TestJobSuccess
- What: queue smoke-test fixtures.
- Why parked: they assert nothing about the product (synthesis §4 park; R's
  claim-in-jobs reading rejected there).
- Resolves: none needed; optionally citable by U61 as a reference line if the
  jobs spec wants a smoke-test mention.

### JOB-047 — abstract staged-file-processing framework base
- What: framework base for staged file processing jobs.
- Why parked: no feature-visible behavior of its own.
- Resolves: none needed — permanent infra atom.

### NOTIF-056..065 — `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_BOOK_*` (books for review)
- What: ten OJS notification types (book requested, created, updated,
  deleted, mailed, settings saved, submission assigned, author assigned,
  denied, removed) declared in OJS's `APP\notification\Notification` and
  titled in its `NotificationManager` with
  `plugins.generic.booksForReview.*` keys.
- Why parked: leftovers of the old third-party "Books for Review" plugin.
  OJS bundles no such plugin and nothing in the three apps raises these
  types. They are not an OMP surface, although Phase 0 listed them among
  the OMP drops. Moved here from FEATURE-MAP's out-of-scope list by the
  2026-09-27 scope extension. Code-verified 2026-09-27 (checkout ojs
  `3162c105bf`).
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).

### PLUG-024 — OPS `preprintToJournal` (journal relay)
- What: a plugin that relays a posted preprint into a journal submission.
- Why parked: not an OPS surface. The atlas swept an untracked local folder
  in the sweep's checkout. OPS main does not bundle the plugin: a
  submodule of that name was committed by accident in 2024 and removed in
  `e56f9e8a9f` ("Remove accidental submodule"). Moved here from FEATURE-MAP's
  out-of-scope list by the 2026-09-27 scope extension.
- Resolves: none needed; claim it only if OPS ever bundles it.

## Dead-code / defect candidates attached to claimed atoms (RULINGS + spec-time additions)

These atoms ARE claimed in FEATURE-MAP; the notes below travel with them to
spec time as register material. Listed here so the candidates have one home
until their specs exist. Do not force-claim the defects themselves.

1. **catalogCategory.tpl unassigned variables** — resolved 2026-09-27: the Catalog browse spec's register
   [A7](../specs/U68-catalog-browse.md#a7) carries it (Rule 14 there).
2. **Dangling `results` op** — resolved 2026-09-27: the Catalog browse spec's register
   [A9](../specs/U68-catalog-browse.md#a9) carries it.
3. **SectionController `filterByTypeIds()` dispatch** — resolved 2026-09-25: the Sections spec's register
   [A4](../specs/U17-sections.md#a4) carries it.
4. **Missing OMP dashboard series filter** — resolved 2026-09-25: the Submissions dashboard's
   register OMP1 carries it ([U23](../specs/U23-submissions-dashboard.md)); the Sections spec states it (Rule 3).
5. **`api/v1/sections` mount gap** — resolved 2026-09-25: the Sections spec's register
   [A5](../specs/U17-sections.md#a5) carries it.
6. **OMP "Request Revisions" author email invites a response OMP cannot
   collect** — attached to **U30** (author response) / mail templates. The
   press email asks the author to "submit your response" but OMP mounts no
   Author Response panel (the shipped review-stage spec's register documents
   the panel absence; the template mismatch is U30's / the mail templates').
   Resolves: U30 spec-time register entry; reconcile template with the press
   roster.
7. **AFFW-068 dead-in-context** — attached to **U21** (claimed; the
   submission-wizard spec's footnote a + Reference row document the verdict).
   The legacy `SubmissionsListPanel` "New Submission" button renders on none
   of its remaining mounts: the Native XML import/export screen is the
   panel's only server-side mount and blanks the panel's add URL by
   construction (`PKPNativeImportExportPlugin`); the button renders only when
   an add URL is set. Live-verified 2026-08-25 as manager on OJS, OMP and
   OPS. Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidate).
8. **AFFW-711 dead-code candidate** — attached to **U40** (claimed; the
   publication-metadata spec's Reference table documents the waiver). The
   "View submission metadata" modal's template
   (`lib/pkp/templates/controllers/modals/submission/viewSubmissionMetadata.tpl`)
   does not exist in any of the session's pinned checkouts (ojs ac67a6dd76,
   omp 244a04311c, ops 94f6bbc59a, incl. lib/pkp submodules) — the atlas row
   describes a file a later refactor removed; no screen offers the modal.
   Code-verified 2026-08-28 (spec-author sweep of all three checkouts).
   Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead atlas row (atom retire
   candidate).
9. **GRID-051 + AFFW-681..686 dead-surface candidates** — attached to
   **U41** (claimed; the contributors-and-affiliations spec's Reference
   table documents the waiver). The legacy pre-3.4 author grid
   (`PKP\controllers\grid\users\author\AuthorGridHandler` and its six row
   affordances) has no mount site in any of the session's pinned checkouts
   (ojs ac67a6dd76, omp 244a04311c, ops 94f6bbc59a): no template, page or
   plugin references the grid's component route — only the class files and
   autoloader entries remain — and OPS lacks the app-side form class the
   handler instantiates, so invoking it there would fatal. Code-verified
   2026-08-28 (spec-author sweep of templates/pages/plugins in all three
   checkouts). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal
   candidate).
10. **AFFW-243 dead-code candidate** — attached to **U33** (claimed; the
    production-stage spec's Reference table documents the waiver). The
    "Change decision" link (`WorkflowActionChangeDecision.vue`) is imported
    and registered in `WorkflowPageOPS.vue` and mounted by no workflow
    config in any app: a grep of the three `lib/ui-library/src` trees finds
    only the import and the `Components` entry, so no screen renders it.
    Code-verified 2026-09-19 (spec-author sweep; checkouts ojs 7c8d69af3e, omp
    0ec98a508, ops 9ce633ee1d). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code
    (removal candidate).
11. **GRID-022 unmounted legacy grid** — attached to **U33** (claimed; the
    production-stage spec's Reference table documents the waiver). The
    legacy `ProductionReadyFilesGridHandler` is referenced by no template,
    config or page in the three checkouts; the Vue "Production Ready Files"
    list (`useFileManagerConfig.js` `PRODUCTION_READY_FILES`, listing
    through the submission-files API and uploading through the shared
    upload wizard) is the live surface. Code-verified 2026-09-19 (checkouts
    as above). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal
    candidate).
12. **GRID-023 unreachable outside OMP's publication formats** — attached to
    **U33** (claimed; the production-stage spec's Reference table documents
    the waiver). `ManageProofFilesGridHandler` is mounted only from
    `templates/controllers/grid/files/proof/manageProofFiles.tpl`, which
    only OMP's `PublicationFormatGridHandler` renders inside the
    publication-format window (U73, *Publication formats & proof terms*,
    since the 2026-09-27 scope extension); on a journal or preprint server
    no screen reaches it. The
    window's form, AFFW-612, is U36's atom and shares this verdict (the
    submission-files spec's Reference table, 2026-09-23).
    Code-verified 2026-09-19 (checkouts as above). On OMP the U73 draft
    claims it ("Select Files", its Rule 10 and Reference table,
    2026-09-28). Resolves: dead on OJS and OPS pending maintainer
    confirmation.
13. **NOTIF-021..028 normal-level notices with no reader** — attached to
    **U34** (claimed; the decision-recording spec's register entry A5
    documents it). `EditorDecisionNotificationManager::updateNotification()`
    writes an author notice on every decision, but only the two revision
    types are task-level and reach the header Tasks panel; the normal-level
    ones ("Submission accepted.", "Production process started." and the
    rest) are fetched by no template or Vue component in lib/pkp, the
    ui-library or the three apps (`WorkflowNotificationDisplay.vue` asks for
    the copyediting and production notice types alone); the retired author
    dashboard was their surface. Code-verified 2026-09-20 (checkouts as
    above). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead display (the rows are
    still written; removal candidate for the message and URL branches).
14. **NOTIF-014, NOTIF-016..018 per-stage editor-assignment notices with no
    reader** — attached to **U35** (claimed; the stage-participants spec's
    note o and Reference table document it).
    `EditorAssignmentNotificationManager::updateNotification()` still
    creates and deletes the per-stage "An editor must be assigned before
    review is initiated…" rows (no user, task level) on every assignment and
    removal, but no template or Vue component in lib/pkp, the ui-library or
    the three apps fetches those types (`WorkflowNotificationDisplay.vue`
    asks for the copyediting and production types only), and
    `WorkflowHandler::getEditorAssignmentNotificationTypeByStageId()` has no
    caller. Code-verified 2026-09-22 (checkouts ojs 7c8d69af3e, omp
    c6a132892, ops 4bb66b1469). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead
    display (removal candidate; OMP's internal-review sibling NOTIF-015 is
    the same).
15. **NOTIF-046 editor-assign task never raised** — attached to **U35**
    (claimed; the spec's register entry A6 documents it).
    `PKPStageParticipantNotifyForm::sendMessage()` raises
    `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_EDITOR_ASSIGN` only for the template key
    `EDITOR_ASSIGN`, while every installed "Assign Editor" template carries
    `EDITOR_ASSIGN_SUBMISSION`, `_REVIEW` or `_PRODUCTION`
    (`registry/taskTemplates.xml` in all three apps); nothing else raises
    the type. Code-verified 2026-09-22 (checkouts as above). Resolves: a
    fix (match the per-stage keys) or maintainer confirmation as dead.
16. **GRID-054 legacy grid rendering ops unmounted** — attached to **U35**
    (claimed; the spec's note o documents the waiver). The
    `StageParticipantGridHandler` ops that render the old participants grid
    (`fetchGrid`, `fetchRow`, `fetchCategory`, with `StageParticipantGridRow`
    and its link actions) and `fetchUserList` are loaded by no template,
    page or Vue component; the Vue Participants panel (VUE-043) is the live
    surface and calls only `addParticipant`, `saveParticipant`,
    `deleteParticipant`, `viewNotify`, `sendNotification` and
    `fetchTemplateBody`, which stay claimed. Code-verified 2026-09-22
    (checkouts as above). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code
    (removal candidate for the rendering ops and the row class).
17. **AFFW-599 proof-file "Edit Metadata" tabset unreachable outside OMP's
    publication formats** — attached to **U36** (claimed; the
    submission-files spec's Reference table documents the waiver).
    `PKPManageFileApiHandler::editMetadata()` renders the
    `editMetadata.tpl` tabset ("Edit Metadata", "Identifiers") only for a
    proof file; the Vue file lists never hold proof files, the galley
    rows (`GalleyManager`) offer no file-edit action, and the legacy
    selection windows list no proof stage
    (`SubmissionFilesCategoryGridDataProvider::_getFileStagesByStageId()`),
    so on a journal or preprint server no screen opens it; OMP overrides
    the op for its publication-format proof files (U73).
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (U36 spec author; checkouts ojs `38781720df`,
    lib/pkp `f8bacd765`, ui-library `5d138aa9`). On OMP the U73 draft
    claims it (a format file's "Edit a file", its Rule 11 and Reference
    table, 2026-09-28). Resolves: dead on OJS and OPS pending maintainer
    confirmation.
18. **AFFW-594 revision-only wizard with nothing to revise, liveness
    unknown** — attached to **U36** (claimed; the submission-files spec's
    Reference table notes it). The message "There are no files for you to
    revise at this time." renders only for a `revisionOnly` upload with no
    preset file and no revisable file. The only callers passing
    `revisionOnly` without a preset file are `AddRevisionLinkAction`, built
    by `PendingRevisionsNotificationManager::getNotificationContents()` and
    the legacy `ReviewRevisionsGridDataProvider`; the header Tasks grid
    shows the notice's message, not its contents
    (`NotificationsGridCellProvider`), and the galley "Change File" always
    presets the file. No current screen was found rendering that link.
    Code read 2026-09-23 (U36 spec author; checkouts as above). Resolves:
    a live probe of the pending-revisions notice's surfaces, then
    maintainer confirmation as dead or a claim in the spec.
19. **Unlinked information ops, OMP's `contentOnly`, the contact page's
    `contactTitle`** — attached to **U07** (claimed; the
    journal-identity spec's notes u and v document them). OJS
    `InformationHandler` answers `competingInterestGuidelines` (reading
    the context setting `competingInterestsPolicy`) and OMP's answers
    `competingInterestPolicy` (reading `competingInterestPolicy`); no
    context schema of the three apps defines either setting, so the page
    is always empty. Both apps' `sampleCopyrightWording` op prints
    `manager.setup.copyrightNotice.sample`. No template, menu type,
    email or Vue component in the three checkouts links any of these
    ops (`grep -rn` over `.tpl`, `.php`, `.js`, `.vue`, `.xml`, `.json`
    outside the page handlers and `pages/information/index.php`). OMP's
    `contentOnly` request parameter (hides the header and footer of an
    information page) is set by nothing. `contact.tpl` prints
    `contactTitle`, which no form, schema property or API writes.
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (checkouts ojs 802202cb3e, omp 7f9455d5a,
    ops 15f0b6e0bd). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code
    (removal candidates).
20. **API-044 note delete unreachable and always refused** — attached to
    **U37** (claimed; the tasks-and-discussions spec's Reference table
    lists the route). `DELETE submissions/{id}/tasks/{taskId}/notes/{noteId}`
    has no caller in the ui-library (no screen offers deleting a message),
    and it cannot succeed: `NoteAccessPolicy` (write) denies every note
    that is not the head note, and `EditorialTaskController::deleteNote()`
    refuses the head note. Code-verified 2026-09-23 (U37 spec author;
    checkouts ojs `802202cb3e`, lib/pkp `5af3b3933`, ui-library
    `2034439a`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead (removal
    candidate), or a screen for deleting a reply with a policy that allows
    it.
21. **Unrendered discussions-manager pieces** — attached to **U37**
    (claimed). `useDiscussionManagerConfig.js` grants
    `TASKS_AND_DISCUSSIONS_SEARCH`, but nothing renders it and the store's
    `discussionSearch()` calls an action `useDiscussionManagerActions.js`
    does not define; the texts `task.reopenThisTask` /
    `task.confirmReopenTask` are reachable only through a box that is
    always disabled (the spec's register entry A13); and
    `editorialTask/Repository::countOpenPerStage()` has no caller.
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (checkouts as above). Resolves: maintainer
    confirmation as dead code.
22. **Unreachable activity-log pieces** — attached to **U38** (claimed;
    the activity-log spec's Reference table lists them). A note's
    attached-file download link (AFFW-692): `note.tpl` renders
    `$noteFileDownloadLink`, which no handler or form assigns, so no note
    ever shows it. The submissions list item's "Activity Log & Notes"
    button (`SubmissionsListItem.vue::openInfoCenter()`): every mount of
    `SubmissionsListPanel` (the native, PubMed and ONIX export plugins)
    replaces the item through its `item` slot, so the expanded item that
    holds the button never renders; the workflow header's "Activity Log"
    is the one door. API-018's `GET emails/{emailId}`
    (`PKPEmailController::getEmail()`): no ui-library caller (the
    author's "Notifications" list reads `emails/authorEmails` only).

23. **Unrendered fallback menus and the legacy menu form** — attached to
    **U08** (claimed; the navigation-menus spec's Reference table
    documents the waiver). Each app's
    `templates/frontend/components/primaryNavMenu.tpl` (AFFR-004, AFFR-005,
    AFFR-006: a hand-written primary menu for a journal with none
    configured) is included by no template, page or plugin in any
    checkout: `header.tpl` renders only `{load_menu name="primary"}`,
    which draws nothing when no menu fills the area. The legacy
    `PKP\controllers\grid\navigationMenus\form\NavigationMenuForm` and
    `templates/controllers/grid/navigationMenus/form/navigationMenuForm.tpl`
    (named by AFFM-031) are instantiated nowhere since the grid opens the
    Vue `NavigationMenuManagerFormModal` (pkp-lib#12177, 2026-01-22); the

    libraries spec's Reference table lists them). GRID-030
    `SelectableLibraryFileGridHandler` (a tick-box list of Publisher
    Library files): no template, handler or ui-library code loads
    `grid.files.SelectableLibraryFileGridHandler` (the email composer's
    "Library Files" reads the `_library` API instead). The legacy author
    dashboard's `submissionLibraryUrl`
    (`PKPAuthorDashboardHandler::setupTemplate()`): the page's
    `submission()` forwards to My Submissions before anything renders,

    citations spec's Reference table lists them).
    `lib/ui-library/src/managers/CitationManager/CitationManagerMetadataLookup.vue`
    (a per-submission lookup switch) is imported by no component and binds
    `citationStore.formEnableLookup`, which the store never defines; the

    `.enableCitationsMetadataLookup`) and the "Add" result messages
    (`submission.citations.structured.addRaw.*`) have no caller in

    (`PKPAuthorDashboardHandler::setupTemplate()`, `PKPCitationsForm` under
    `components.citations`): the page's `submission()` forwards to My

    `view` and `index` ops of `lib/pkp/pages/navigationMenu/` without a
    custom item (`NavigationMenuItemHandler::view()` returns `false` when
    no item was handed over; `index()` redirects there): no template,

    `controllers/grid/pubIds/form/AssignPublicIdentifiersForm.php` and
    `templates/controllers/grid/pubIds/form/assignPublicIdentifiersForm.tpl`

    `PKPSubmission` branch posts to `tab.issueEntry.IssueEntryTabHandler`
    `assignPubIds`, a handler that exists in no app (AFFW-605's live
    half is the issue branch, "Publish Issue"). The submission branch of
    each app's `publicIdentifiersForm.tpl` (the article's identifiers
    moved to the Vue "Identifiers" page). OJS and OPS
    `ManageFileApiHandler` `identifiers` / `updateIdentifiers` /
    `clearPubId` (GRID-067, GRID-100): `editMetadata.tpl` shows its
    "Identifiers" tab only when `showIdentifierTab` is assigned, which only
    OMP's subclass does, so no OJS or OPS screen opens them (a typed
    address still reaches them). OJS `issueForm.tpl`'s `$pubIdPlugins`
    loop (`IssueForm` never assigns the variable) and the OJS
    `PubIdPlugin::manage()` verb `assignPubIds` (no URN screen posts

    `ArticleGalleyGridHandler`'s rendering operations (`fetchGrid`,
    `fetchRow` with its `uploadFile` event), `ArticleGalleyGridRow`'s row
    actions ("Edit a Layout Galley" / "View Galley", the upload action,
    "Delete") and `ArticleGalleyGridCellProvider`, the grid's own "Add
    galley" link and `js/controllers/grid/articleGalleys/ArticleGalleyGridHandler.js`:
    loaded only through `representationsGridUrl`, which the retired
    author dashboard (`PKPAuthorDashboardHandler`) assigns and no current
    screen reads; the workflow's "Galleys" page (`GalleyManager`) calls
    only the edit, delete and ordering operations. OPS's copies stay live
    in the submission wizard's "Upload Files" step (`templates/submission/galleys.tpl`,
    U21); OPS `WorkflowHandler::_getRepresentationsGridUrl()` has no
    caller. The `galleyView` window's heading `submission.layout.viewGalley`

29. **Unreached media-file pieces** — attached to **U47** (claimed; the
    media-files spec's Reference table notes them). The
    `variantGroupIds` and `variantTypes` query filters of
    `MediaFilesController::getMany()` (API-041): the "Media" page fetches
    the whole list and no screen passes either. The `canEdit` value
    `workflowConfigEditorialOJS.js` passes to `MediaFileManager` (AFFW-420):
    the component declares no such prop, so it falls through as an
    attribute and nothing reads it (the root of the spec's A1). OPS
    `PreprintHandler::download()`'s admission of a publication's media
    file ids for a galley: OPS installs no HTML galley renderer, so no
    page produces such an address (the spec's OPS1; pending the claim

30. **Unmounted landing-page display components** — attached to **U13**
    (AFFR-056, ROUTE-033; claimed). OJS `ArticleHandler::view()` builds an
    `OpenReviewComponent` configuration, locale keys and icons for every
    article page, but no template mounts an open-review display

    (claimed; the JATS & Body Text spec's Reference tables note them).
    `PKPWorkflowHandler::getJatsPanel()` and
    `PKP\components\PublicationSectionJats` (AFFW-403's legacy twin): OJS
    `WorkflowHandler` still builds the panel's config into the page's
    `components`, but no Vue component or template reads it; the page's
    "JATS XML" is `WorkflowPublicationJats`. The Body Text API's `DELETE`

    "JATS Template Plugin"'s `jatsTemplate/download` page operation

32. **Categories API form route with no method** — attached to **U16**
    (API-010; claimed; the Categories spec's Reference tables note it).
    `CategoryCategoryController::getGroupRoutes()` registers `GET
    categories/categoryFormComponent` to `$this->getCategoryFormComponent(...)`,
    a method no class in the chain defines (Laravel's `Controller::__call()`
    lets the route register and would answer a server error when called);
    no screen calls it, the tab gets its form from the page
    (`ManagementHandler::context()`). Also: the category `fullSize` page
    op (lib/pkp `PKPCatalogHandler`, OMP `CatalogHandler`) is linked from
    no page in any app (the category page's picture sits in a `div`, the
    Categories spec's A6). Code-verified

    claimed; the Sections spec's footnotes note them). OMP's
    `schemas/section.json` carries `featured` and `reviewFormId` for a
    series: `SeriesForm::readInputData()` reads `featured`, but no field
    of `seriesForm.tpl` posts it, so every save stores it off, and nothing
    in OMP reads `Section::getFeatured()`; no series field sets
    `reviewFormId`, which `ReviewerForm::initData()` would read for a
    press's default review form. Code-verified 2026-09-25 (U17 spec

34. **Unlinked users-list entry points** — attached to **U53** (VUE-051,
    GRID-050; claimed; the Users management spec's Reference tables note
    them). `ContextGridHandler::users()` (the Hosted Journals grid, site
    administrator only) returns `management/accessUsers.tpl`, the Vue
    users list, as a grid fragment; no row action of `ContextGridRow`
    ("Edit", "Settings wizard", "Remove") and no template calls it, and the
    administrator's per-journal users surface is the Settings wizard's
    "Users" tab (the legacy `UserGridHandler` grid). The page operation
    `management/access` (`ManagementHandler::access()`, granted to the site
    administrator alone in each app's `SettingsHandler`) renders the same
    Users & Roles page as `management/settings/access`, but no menu or link

    AFFM-109; claimed; the Roles configuration spec's Reference tables
    note them). `UserGroupGridHandler` grants and routes `fetchCategory`,
    but the roles list is not a category grid (no `GridCategoryRow`, no
    category data), so nothing calls it. In `UserGroupForm`,
    `settings.roles.roleIdRequired` ("You need to define a role permission
    level.") guards a select that always carries a value, and the
    template's hidden `settings.roles.stageIdRequired` label ("You need to

    `index()` after the access decision, decode an `Authorization:
    Bearer` API key and store it with `setApiToken()` ("Permit the use
    of the Authorization header and an API key for access to unpublished
    content"), but every OAI records query serves published items only
    and no screen or client of the app sends the header; a token that

    falls back to a sentence ("No primary contact has been defined for
    this journal…", `…copySubmissionAckPrimaryContact.disabled.description`,
    which OPS's locale lacks) when the context has no contact email, but
    every screen that sets the contact (Settings › Journal › "Contact",
    the Hosted Journals create form) requires one. `Mailable::$canDisable`
    / `canDisable()` is set on eleven mailables and read by nothing; the
    switching-off the setup form does goes through
    `Repository::isMailableEnabled()` instead. `ManageEmailsPage`'s

    posts to `tab.settings.AdminSettingsTabHandler`, which no longer

39. **Unreachable DOI pieces** — attached to **U45** (API-001,
    AFFU-244, ROUTE-010, PLUG-009, PLUG-011; claimed). Author-response
    DOIs: the `authorResponse` kind is commented out of OJS
    `DoiSetupSettingsForm`, so no journal can tick it, yet
    `DoiListPanelOJS.vue` builds its rows, `_dois/authorResponses/{id}`
    is routed, and the collectors join its table. `PKPDoisHandler`
    role-assigns a `management` op with no method, and its `index()`
    builds the Setup and Registration forms into the DOIs page's state,
    which `dois.tpl` never mounts. The Crossref and DataCite export
    plugins' `manage` settings path calls `getSettingsFormClassName()`,
    which throws ("DOI settings no longer managed via plugin settings
    form."); the Plugins list links those rows to the Tools page instead,
    so nothing opens it. OMP `DoiSetupSettingsForm` removes an
    `automaticDoiDeposit` field it never has. Legacy locale keys
    (`doi.editor.*`, `doi.manager.settings.doiReassign*`,
    `doi.manager.settings.doiAssignJournalWide*`,

41. **Unreached payment pieces** — attached to **U52** (AFFM-182,
    NOTIF-036, ROUTE-052's `payMembership`; claimed). The "Payments" tab's
    list (`PaymentsGridHandler`) role-assigns a `viewPayment` op whose body
    is `// FIXME` and no row links to it, so the payment "Details" window
    exists nowhere. `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_CONFIGURE_PAYMENT_METHOD` has its
    message and style in lib/pkp but nothing on a journal raises it, nor
    on a press: OMP's publication-format "Metadata" tab asks for it, yet no
    code in any app creates it (U73 spec author, 2026-09-28, omp
    `3cd59e944`; the U73 register's A9). OJS
    `UserHandler::payMembership()` is routed but no template links to it,
    and `OJSPaymentManager::createQueuedPayment()` marks the membership
    type deprecated (`error_log` + `assert(false)`), so the "Association
    Membership" fee has no purchase path (the spec's A7); the locale keys

    (AFFM-047, AFFM-048, AFFM-049; claimed). `PluginHelper::isGalleryAllowed()`
    always answers true (`getCapabilities()` sets `canSeeGallery` on every

    `PluginHelper::isPluginInstallDisabled()` has no caller.
    `PluginHelper::upgradePlugin()` throws with
    `manager.plugins.uploadDisabled`, a key no locale defines, on a path
    only a direct `saveUploadPlugin` request reaches (no screen offers
    "Upgrade" while uploads are off). `uploadPluginForm.tpl` tests
    `$function == 'install'`, a value the form never receives (the

    `e9f6f4f550`, lib/pkp `1ad4a14bb2`). Resolves: maintainer
    confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).

44. **The site "Languages" list's journal branch** — attached to **U57**
    (AFFM-216, GRID-005; claimed; the Languages & locales spec's
    Reference table documents the waiver). `AdminLanguageGridHandler`
    adds the "UI" and "Forms" columns and makes "Primary locale" set a
    journal's primary language when `_canManage()` holds (one journal on
    the site, a journal in the request, a manager role), and
    `LanguageGridRow` offers "Reload defaults" only with a journal in the
    request. The list is mounted by `lib/pkp/templates/admin/settings.tpl`
    alone, and `AdminHandler::authorize()` refuses every Administration
    request made at a journal's address, so the request never has a
    journal there: the columns, the journal-primary radio and the site
    row's "Reload defaults" (AFFM-216) render nowhere, and the
    `saveLanguageSetting` / `setContextPrimaryLocale` ops the grid
    inherits are unreached from it. Code-verified 2026-09-27 (U57 spec
    author; checkouts ojs `3162c105bf`, lib/pkp `1ad4a14bb2`). Resolves:
    maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidate).

45. **Internal-review decisions no button offers, and a dead author-dashboard
    branch** — attached to **U71** (OMP Internal Review, section H).
    `ResubmitInternal` exists as a class but is not registered in
    `APP\decision\Repository::getDecisionTypes()`;
    `RecommendResubmitInternal` is registered, and the ui-library's
    `useWorkflowDecisions.js` has handlers for both, but no internal-stage
    control offers either (the stage has no Resubmit choice). OMP's
    `AuthorDashboardHandler::_getNotificationRequestOptions()` has no caller
    and no parent in lib/pkp; it is the only code that asks for NOTIF-020.
    Also unreached: `ReviewRound::REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_SENT_TO_EXTERNAL`
    and its sentence `editor.submission.roundStatus.sentToExternal` ("Sent
    for external review."), which no code sets (OMP's `SendExternalReview`
    sets `REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_ACCEPTED`), and the `RESUBMIT_INTERNAL`
    branch of `ReviewRound::determineStatus()`, which needs a decision no
    control records (`ResubmitInternal::getDecision()` returns
    `PENDING_REVISIONS_INTERNAL` besides). Whether the registered
    `RecommendResubmitInternal` still records through a typed wizard
    address is the U71 spec's note td-resubmit.
    Code-verified 2026-09-27 (checkout omp `72a01a026`; the additions on omp
    `3cd59e944`, lib/pkp `17a1f01fed`, U71 spec author). Resolves: the U71
    spec confirms by probe; then maintainer confirmation as dead code.

46. **The OPS "Author Screening" tab on a standard install** — attached to
    **U58** (AFFM-064; claimed; the Submission intake configuration
    spec's Rule 21 and OPS2 document it as an install fact). OPS
    `SettingsHandler::workflow()` adds the tab only when a plugin answers
    the hook `Settings::Workflow::listScreeningPlugins` with rules, and no
    plugin, class or template in the OPS checkout registers that hook, so
    the tab renders on no install the application ships. A third-party
    screening plugin would make it live. Code-verified 2026-09-27 (U58
    spec author; checkout ops `e2111e3aae`, lib/pkp `17a1f01fed`).
    Resolves: maintainer ruling whether a bundled or documented screening
    plugin is expected; otherwise a liveness waiver.

47. **Unreached catalog-management pieces** — attached to **U70** (ROUTE-062,
    AFFM-266, NOTIF-038; claimed). OMP `pages/manageCatalog/index.php`
    routes the op `homepage` to `ManageCatalogHandler`, which has no such
    method and grants it to no role. The legacy filter form
    `templates/controllers/grid/manageCatalog/form/catalogMonographsFilterForm.tpl`
    has no grid handler left (`controllers/grid/manageCatalog` does not
    exist). The string `submission.catalogEntry.add` ("Add Selected to
    Catalog") is used nowhere; the "Add Entry" panel saves with "Save".
    `ApproveSubmissionNotificationManager::getNotificationUrl()` builds a
    `manageCatalog` link for the "Catalog Management" notice, but the only
    display of that notice (`WorkflowNotificationDisplay.vue`) prints title
    and text, and the record has no user, so no notification list shows
    it. Code-verified 2026-09-27 (U70 spec author; checkout omp
    `72a01a026`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal
    candidates).
48. **The OPS `relate` route and the legacy relation forms nobody renders** —
    attached to **U75** (Preprint relations; API-065's `relate` operation,
    atom claimed by U49, whose scope note leaves the operation to U75).
    `PUT submissions/{id}/publications/{id}/relate` is called by no screen:
    its only callers build a `RelationForm` aimed at it in
    `APP\pages\workflow\WorkflowHandler::setupIndex()` and
    `APP\pages\authorDashboard\AuthorDashboardHandler::setupTemplate()`,
    and both pages now redirect to the dashboard
    (`PKPWorkflowHandler::access()/index()`,
    `PKPAuthorDashboardHandler::submission()`), which render no template
    that reads those forms. The live "Relations" dropdown
    (`WorkflowPublicationRelationDropdownOPS.vue`) and the wizard's
    relation question post to the plain publication route instead.
    Code-verified 2026-09-27 (U75 spec author; checkout ops `e2111e3aae`,
    lib/pkp `17a1f01fed`, ui-library `03d1cee2`). Resolves: the U75 claim
    check confirms no screen sends it; then maintainer confirmation as dead
    code (removal candidate), or a ruling that the dropdown should post to
    it (the U75 spec's register A1).

49. **Unused monograph cover server** — attached to **U68** (GRID-099;
    claimed). OMP `controllers/submission/CoverHandler.php` (ops `cover`,
    `thumbnail`) is requested only by
    `templates/controllers/monographList/coverImage.tpl`, which no
    template, page or script includes since the catalog listing moved to
    a grid in 2016 (omp `b3b90f358`); the public book summaries and the
    book page print the cover's public file (`Publication::getLocalizedCoverImageThumbnailUrl()`).
    The Catalog browse spec's Reference table records it. Code-verified
    2026-09-27 (U68 spec author; checkout omp `72a01a026`). Resolves:
    maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).

50. **Unused hosted-journals pieces** — attached to **U59** (GRID-004,
    API-013; claimed; the Hosted journals spec's Reference table notes
    them). `ContextGridHandler::__construct()` grants the op
    `updateContext` to the site administrator, but the handler has no
    such method (the journal form saves through the contexts API).
    `PKPContextController`'s `DELETE contexts/{id}` is sent by no screen:
    a row's "Remove" deletes through the grid's own `deleteContext` op.
    Code-verified 2026-09-27 (U59 spec author; checkouts ojs
    `72b85f4ba0`, omp `3cd59e944`, ops `e2111e3aae`, lib/pkp
    `26ae6431b5` / `17a1f01fed`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as
    dead code (the op name) and a ruling that the delete request is an
    intended API for outside clients.
51. **Unreached chapter-grid pieces** — attached to **U72** (GRID-097;
    claimed). OMP `ChapterGridHandler`'s constructor grants `addAuthor`,
    `editAuthor`, `updateAuthor` and `deleteAuthor` to the author,
    sub-editor, manager and assistant roles, but the class defines no
    such methods (chapter authors are ticked in the chapter form); it
    also grants `fetchGrid` and `fetchRow` to the reviewer role, yet no
    reviewer screen mounts the chapter list. `WorkflowHandler` and
    `AuthorDashboardHandler` still build a `chaptersGridUrl` page-state
    value that no ui-library component reads (`ChapterManager.vue`
    builds its own grid request). The Chapters & work type spec's notes
    c and f record the reachable surface. Code-verified 2026-09-28 (U72
    spec author; checkout omp `72a01a026`, ui-library `03d1cee2`).
    Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).
52. **Unused user-counts request** — attached to **U65** (API-040;
    claimed; the Statistics — editorial activity & reports spec's
    Reference table notes it). `PKPStatsUserController`'s `GET
    stats/users` is sent by no screen: Statistics › "Users" draws its
    counts on the page (`PKPStatsHandler::users()` passes
    `getRolesOverview()` to `templates/stats/users.tpl`), and neither
    `StatsUsersPage.vue` nor any other ui-library component or template
    requests it. Code-verified 2026-09-28 (U65 spec author; checkouts ojs
    `72b85f4ba0`, omp `3cd59e944`, ops `e2111e3aae`, lib/pkp
    `26ae6431b5` / `17a1f01fed`, ui-library `03d1cee2`). Resolves:
    maintainer ruling that it is an intended API for outside clients, or
    confirmation as dead code.
53. **Unreached publication-format pieces** — attached to **U73**
    (AFFW-765, AFFW-768; claimed). OMP `PublicationFormatMetadataForm`
    keeps a `directSalesPrice` check and assigns `paymentConfigured` and
    `currency` for fields the "Metadata" tab no longer renders (the price
    moved to the file's terms window), and requests the
    configure-payment notice nobody creates (item 41).
    `digitalPublicationFormat.tpl` (AFFW-768, the "Digital Information"
    group with its file-size override) is never rendered because
    `editFormatMetadata()` leaves `$isPhysicalFormat` at its default
    `true`; that one is a defect, the U73 register's A6, not dead code.
    `SubmissionEventLogEntry::SUBMISSION_LOG_PUBLICATION_FORMAT_METADATA_UPDATE`
    is defined and never written. Code-verified 2026-09-28 (U73 spec
    author; checkout omp `3cd59e944`, lib/pkp `17a1f01fed`). Resolves:
    maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates), and the
    A6 fix for the digital group.
54. **Unreached ONIX pieces** — attached to **U74** (PLUG-033, GRID-090,
    GRID-094, AFFW-431, AFFW-760; claimed). OMP
    `PublicationFormat::hasNeededONIXFields()` and
    `_checkRequiredFieldsAssigned()` (the "no markets / no codes /
    file size required" pre-export check) are called by nothing.
    `AudienceForm::$successMessage` (`monograph.audience.success` "The
    audience details have been updated.") is set and never shown (the
    Vue form shows "Saved"). `MarketForm::fetch()` assigns
    `extentTypeCodes` (list 23) that `marketForm.tpl` never uses; the
    template's price section passes `desc=`
    `monograph.publicationFormat.pricingInformation`, a parameter the
    section does not render and a key no locale file defines; the
    server-side messages `grid.catalogEntry.priceRequired` and
    `grid.catalogEntry.typeRequired` are keys no locale file defines,
    behind checks the browser-side required check (price) or a list with
    no empty choice (type) keeps from firing. `Onix30ExportPlugin::executeCLI()`
    and `usage()` throw `BadMethodCallException`, so the tool has no
    command-line use. The ONIX metadata & export spec's notes d, f, g
    and i record the reachable surface. Code-verified 2026-09-28 (U74
    spec author; checkout omp `3cd59e944`, lib/pkp `17a1f01fed`,
    ui-library `03d1cee2`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead
    code (removal candidates), or the missing locale keys added.
55. **Unread archiving leftovers** — attached to **U67** (AFFM-098,
    ROUTE-037; claimed). OJS `schemas/context.json` still defines
    `lockssLicense` and `clockssLicense` with default texts
    (`default.contextSettings.lockssLicense` / `…clockssLicense`), which
    every new journal receives, but no form, handler or template reads
    or writes them (their form descriptions were removed by ojs
    `d8a46d1bcd`, 2026-03-18). `GatewayHandler::lockss()` / `clockss()`
    assign a `showInfo` value no template reads. OPS
    `pages/gateway/index.php` routes the `lockss` and `clockss` ops to a
    `GatewayHandler` that has no such methods, so both addresses answer
    "404 Not Found" (the same as OMP, whose `index.php` does not list
    them). The Archiving & preservation spec's notes a, h and i record
    the reachable surface. Code-verified 2026-09-28 (U67 spec author;
    checkouts ojs `9d9f116f38`, ops `5da5bc48ad`, lib/pkp `fab29cfeca`).
    Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).
