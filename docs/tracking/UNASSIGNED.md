# UNASSIGNED — parked atoms & dead-code candidates

Atlas atoms no feature claims, parked here so every atom has exactly one
owner; the campaign is done when every entry is claimed by a spec,
confirmed dead (it stays here with its evidence) or ruled out of scope.

Sources (removed from the tip 2026-08-25, reachable in git history): the six crosswalks in `.reports/phase0-feature-map/` (their UNASSIGNED
lists, consistent with `synthesis.md` §4) + `RULINGS.md`'s probe-derived
dead-code additions. **18 parked atoms** + **33 noted dead-code/defect
candidates attached to claimed atoms**. (PLUG-028 moved to FEATURE-MAP's
Out-of-scope tail — see RULINGS.md. Two candidates that rested solely on
scratched pre-reset evidence were dropped 2026-08-21 per the reset doctrine —
if real, their specs' own probes will resurface them.)

## Parked atoms (18)

### AFFW-701, AFFW-703, AFFW-704 — legacy author-dashboard round surfaces
- What: the old author-dashboard templates' editor-message link, author
  reviewer grid, and review attachments + revisions grids (FEATURE-MAP had
  them under U26).
- Why parked: dead — the legacy author-dashboard round panel is unreachable
  (its URLs answer 404; the current author round view is the shared workflow
  screen, per the review-stage spec's retired-legacy-surfaces footnote.
  AFFW-702's email-modal body remains live via the Notifications panel and
  stays claimed by U26).
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).

### GRID-011, GRID-024 — legacy author review-attachment / revisions grids
- What: author-view grids for review attachments and uploaded revision files,
  mounted only from the retired author-dashboard round panel (AFFW-703/704).
- Why parked: dead with their mount — no reachable screen loads them in the
  current UI (same evidence as above; the open-review attachment grid
  GRID-010 is live inside the read-review sheet and stays claimed).
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).

### AFFW-076 — sectionPolicy.tpl start-submission block
- What: OJS template block offering "start a submission" from the section
  policy display; marked deprecated 3.4 — the current Start Submission is the
  Vue form.
- Why parked: liveness unknown; claiming it in U17 or U21 would document a
  possibly-dead surface.
- Resolves: Phase-1 liveness probe (is the block reachable in the current UI?).
- Evidence (U17 spec author, code read 2026-09-25, ojs `d9b567efec`): no
  template, handler, Vue component or JS file of OJS or its lib/pkp names
  `sectionPolicy.tpl`; its only reference is its own header. The live
  start form shows the section policy through `StartSubmission`'s
  `FieldHTML` instead (the Sections spec, Rule 11). Dead-code candidate;
  resolves on maintainer confirmation.

### AFFM-170 — OMP statisticsSettingsForm.tpl
- What: OMP-only settings template that posts to an op no PHP handler declares.
- Why parked: dead-code candidate — the post target does not exist.
- Resolves: Phase-1 probe (does the page render/submit at all?); if dead, stays
  here as confirmed; if live, claim in U64.

### NOTIF-011 — NOTIFICATION_TYPE_PLUGIN_BASE
- What: plugin-type base offset constant.
- Why parked: zero references outside its definition — nothing to specify.
- Resolves: maintainer ruling to confirm dead (grep evidence already in
  synthesis §4); no probe needed.

### ROUTE-043 — OJS legacy `manager` dispatcher stub
- What: legacy page-handler switch that returns no handler for any op.
- Why parked: dead routing stub, no reachable behavior.
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (candidate for removal).

### VUE-004 — ExamplePage
- What: ui-library docs example fixture.
- Why parked: no app mount; not product behavior.
- Resolves: none needed — remains here as a permanent non-product atom unless
  the atlas convention adds a "fixture" marking.

### VUE-042 — NavigationMenuManager component
- What: Vue manager component for navigation menus.
- Why parked: unmounted in any app; only its form modal (VUE-066, claimed by
  U08) is wired.
- Resolves: settled at U08 spec time (2026-09-23): no `NavigationMenuManager.vue`
  exists in any app's ui-library (ojs 2034439a, omp 977e460c, ops 5d138aa9);
  `managers/NavigationMenuManager/` holds only the form modal (VUE-066, claimed
  by U08, opened from the legacy grid), its field, its composable and stories.
  Confirmed dead atlas row; retire candidate.

### API-030 — open-peer-review data API (+ unmounted display components)
- What: OJS-mounted API whose display components (`PkpCite`, `PkpOpenReview`,
  `PkpOrcidDisplay` — recorded in `atlas/affordances-reader.md`'s boundary
  notes, no atom IDs) grep to no mount.
- Why parked: emerging surface with no reachable UI.
- Resolves: Phase-1 liveness probe; if a UI exists, likely U13/U26 territory;
  else stays parked as pre-release machinery.

### API-062 — OMP `publicationPeerReviews` entry point
- What: API mount instantiating a controller class absent from lib/pkp at the
  swept SHA.
- Why parked: dangling mount (confirmed by task ruling in the crosswalk).
- Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code / upstream sync artifact.

### API-066 — OPS legacy non-versioned `api/genres/` entry
- What: legacy alias mount outside `/v1/`.
- Why parked: dead-code candidate pending liveness.
- Resolves: Phase-1 probe (does the alias respond?); if live, claim as a U58
  reference row.

### JOB-001 — abstract queued-job base class
- What: framework base, no feature-visible behavior.
- Why parked: nothing to specify.
- Resolves: none needed — permanent infra atom (mirrors the Q5 infra logic at
  job level).

### JOB-028, JOB-029 — TestJobFailure / TestJobSuccess
- What: queue smoke-test fixtures.
- Why parked: they assert nothing about the product (synthesis §4 park; R's
  claim-in-jobs reading rejected there).
- Resolves: none needed; optionally citable by U61 as a reference line if the
  jobs spec wants a smoke-test mention.

### JOB-047 — abstract staged-file-processing framework base
- What: framework base for staged file processing jobs.
- Why parked: no feature-visible behavior of its own.
- Resolves: none needed — permanent infra atom.

## Dead-code / defect candidates attached to claimed atoms (RULINGS + spec-time additions)

These atoms ARE claimed in FEATURE-MAP; the notes below travel with them to
spec time as register material. Listed here so the candidates have one home
until their specs exist. Do not force-claim the defects themselves.

1. **catalogCategory.tpl unassigned variables** — attached to **U68**
   (OMP-variant category page rows; seam with U16's shared category page).
   The template reads `$featuredMonographIds` / `$newReleasesMonographs`,
   never assigned by the shared handler that renders it
   (probe-omp-catalog.md §7). Resolves: U68/U16 spec-time register entry;
   probe confirms the display silently no-ops.
2. **Dangling `results` op** — attached to **U68** (ROUTE-056, OMP
   `pages/catalog/index.php`). The route map dispatches op `results` to a
   method that exists nowhere in the handler chain (probe-omp-catalog.md §7).
   Resolves: U68 spec-time register entry; dead-code candidate for removal.
3. **SectionController `filterByTypeIds()` dispatch** — resolved 2026-09-25: the Sections spec's register
   [A4](../specs/U17-sections.md#a4) carries it.
4. **Missing OMP dashboard series filter** — resolved 2026-09-25: the Submissions dashboard's
   register OMP1 carries it ([U23](../specs/U23-submissions-dashboard.md)); the Sections spec states it (Rule 3).
5. **`api/v1/sections` mount gap** — resolved 2026-09-25: the Sections spec's register
   [A5](../specs/U17-sections.md#a5) carries it.
6. **OMP "Request Revisions" author email invites a response OMP cannot
   collect** — attached to **U30** (author response) / mail templates. The
   press email asks the author to "submit your response" but OMP mounts no
   Author Response panel (the shipped review-stage spec's register documents
   the panel absence; the template mismatch is U30's / the mail templates').
   Resolves: U30 spec-time register entry; reconcile template with the press
   roster.
7. **AFFW-068 dead-in-context** — attached to **U21** (claimed; the
   submission-wizard spec's footnote a + Reference row document the verdict).
   The legacy `SubmissionsListPanel` "New Submission" button renders on none
   of its remaining mounts: the Native XML import/export screen is the
   panel's only server-side mount and blanks the panel's add URL by
   construction (`PKPNativeImportExportPlugin`); the button renders only when
   an add URL is set. Live-verified 2026-08-25 as manager on OJS, OMP and
   OPS. Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidate).
8. **AFFW-711 dead-code candidate** — attached to **U40** (claimed; the
   publication-metadata spec's Reference table documents the waiver). The
   "View submission metadata" modal's template
   (`lib/pkp/templates/controllers/modals/submission/viewSubmissionMetadata.tpl`)
   does not exist in any of the session's pinned checkouts (ojs ac67a6dd76,
   omp 244a04311c, ops 94f6bbc59a, incl. lib/pkp submodules) — the atlas row
   describes a file a later refactor removed; no screen offers the modal.
   Code-verified 2026-08-28 (spec-author sweep of all three checkouts).
   Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead atlas row (atom retire
   candidate).
9. **GRID-051 + AFFW-681..686 dead-surface candidates** — attached to
   **U41** (claimed; the contributors-and-affiliations spec's Reference
   table documents the waiver). The legacy pre-3.4 author grid
   (`PKP\controllers\grid\users\author\AuthorGridHandler` and its six row
   affordances) has no mount site in any of the session's pinned checkouts
   (ojs ac67a6dd76, omp 244a04311c, ops 94f6bbc59a): no template, page or
   plugin references the grid's component route — only the class files and
   autoloader entries remain — and OPS lacks the app-side form class the
   handler instantiates, so invoking it there would fatal. Code-verified
   2026-08-28 (spec-author sweep of templates/pages/plugins in all three
   checkouts). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal
   candidate).
10. **AFFW-243 dead-code candidate** — attached to **U33** (claimed; the
    production-stage spec's Reference table documents the waiver). The
    "Change decision" link (`WorkflowActionChangeDecision.vue`) is imported
    and registered in `WorkflowPageOPS.vue` and mounted by no workflow
    config in any app: a grep of the three `lib/ui-library/src` trees finds
    only the import and the `Components` entry, so no screen renders it.
    Code-verified 2026-09-19 (spec-author sweep; checkouts ojs 7c8d69af3e, omp
    0ec98a508, ops 9ce633ee1d). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code
    (removal candidate).
11. **GRID-022 unmounted legacy grid** — attached to **U33** (claimed; the
    production-stage spec's Reference table documents the waiver). The
    legacy `ProductionReadyFilesGridHandler` is referenced by no template,
    config or page in the three checkouts; the Vue "Production Ready Files"
    list (`useFileManagerConfig.js` `PRODUCTION_READY_FILES`, listing
    through the submission-files API and uploading through the shared
    upload wizard) is the live surface. Code-verified 2026-09-19 (checkouts
    as above). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal
    candidate).
12. **GRID-023 unreachable outside OMP's publication formats** — attached to
    **U33** (claimed; the production-stage spec's Reference table documents
    the waiver). `ManageProofFilesGridHandler` is mounted only from
    `templates/controllers/grid/files/proof/manageProofFiles.tpl`, which
    only OMP's `PublicationFormatGridHandler` renders inside the
    publication-format window (outside the campaign per FEATURE-MAP's U46
    note); on a journal or preprint server no screen reaches it. The
    window's form, AFFW-612, is U36's atom and shares this verdict (the
    submission-files spec's Reference table, 2026-09-23).
    Code-verified 2026-09-19 (checkouts as above). Resolves: out of scope on
    OMP; dead on OJS and OPS pending maintainer confirmation.
13. **NOTIF-021..028 normal-level notices with no reader** — attached to
    **U34** (claimed; the decision-recording spec's register entry A5
    documents it). `EditorDecisionNotificationManager::updateNotification()`
    writes an author notice on every decision, but only the two revision
    types are task-level and reach the header Tasks panel; the normal-level
    ones ("Submission accepted.", "Production process started." and the
    rest) are fetched by no template or Vue component in lib/pkp, the
    ui-library or the three apps (`WorkflowNotificationDisplay.vue` asks for
    the copyediting and production notice types alone); the retired author
    dashboard was their surface. Code-verified 2026-09-20 (checkouts as
    above). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead display (the rows are
    still written; removal candidate for the message and URL branches).
14. **NOTIF-014, NOTIF-016..018 per-stage editor-assignment notices with no
    reader** — attached to **U35** (claimed; the stage-participants spec's
    note o and Reference table document it).
    `EditorAssignmentNotificationManager::updateNotification()` still
    creates and deletes the per-stage "An editor must be assigned before
    review is initiated…" rows (no user, task level) on every assignment and
    removal, but no template or Vue component in lib/pkp, the ui-library or
    the three apps fetches those types (`WorkflowNotificationDisplay.vue`
    asks for the copyediting and production types only), and
    `WorkflowHandler::getEditorAssignmentNotificationTypeByStageId()` has no
    caller. Code-verified 2026-09-22 (checkouts ojs 7c8d69af3e, omp
    c6a132892, ops 4bb66b1469). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead
    display (removal candidate; OMP's internal-review sibling NOTIF-015 is
    the same).
15. **NOTIF-046 editor-assign task never raised** — attached to **U35**
    (claimed; the spec's register entry A6 documents it).
    `PKPStageParticipantNotifyForm::sendMessage()` raises
    `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_EDITOR_ASSIGN` only for the template key
    `EDITOR_ASSIGN`, while every installed "Assign Editor" template carries
    `EDITOR_ASSIGN_SUBMISSION`, `_REVIEW` or `_PRODUCTION`
    (`registry/taskTemplates.xml` in all three apps); nothing else raises
    the type. Code-verified 2026-09-22 (checkouts as above). Resolves: a
    fix (match the per-stage keys) or maintainer confirmation as dead.
16. **GRID-054 legacy grid rendering ops unmounted** — attached to **U35**
    (claimed; the spec's note o documents the waiver). The
    `StageParticipantGridHandler` ops that render the old participants grid
    (`fetchGrid`, `fetchRow`, `fetchCategory`, with `StageParticipantGridRow`
    and its link actions) and `fetchUserList` are loaded by no template,
    page or Vue component; the Vue Participants panel (VUE-043) is the live
    surface and calls only `addParticipant`, `saveParticipant`,
    `deleteParticipant`, `viewNotify`, `sendNotification` and
    `fetchTemplateBody`, which stay claimed. Code-verified 2026-09-22
    (checkouts as above). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code
    (removal candidate for the rendering ops and the row class).
17. **AFFW-599 proof-file "Edit Metadata" tabset unreachable outside OMP's
    publication formats** — attached to **U36** (claimed; the
    submission-files spec's Reference table documents the waiver).
    `PKPManageFileApiHandler::editMetadata()` renders the
    `editMetadata.tpl` tabset ("Edit Metadata", "Identifiers") only for a
    proof file; the Vue file lists never hold proof files, the galley
    rows (`GalleyManager`) offer no file-edit action, and the legacy
    selection windows list no proof stage
    (`SubmissionFilesCategoryGridDataProvider::_getFileStagesByStageId()`),
    so on a journal or preprint server no screen opens it; OMP overrides
    the op for its publication-format proof files (outside the campaign).
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (U36 spec author; checkouts ojs `38781720df`,
    lib/pkp `f8bacd765`, ui-library `5d138aa9`). Resolves: out of scope on
    OMP; dead on OJS and OPS pending maintainer confirmation.
18. **AFFW-594 revision-only wizard with nothing to revise, liveness
    unknown** — attached to **U36** (claimed; the submission-files spec's
    Reference table notes it). The message "There are no files for you to
    revise at this time." renders only for a `revisionOnly` upload with no
    preset file and no revisable file. The only callers passing
    `revisionOnly` without a preset file are `AddRevisionLinkAction`, built
    by `PendingRevisionsNotificationManager::getNotificationContents()` and
    the legacy `ReviewRevisionsGridDataProvider`; the header Tasks grid
    shows the notice's message, not its contents
    (`NotificationsGridCellProvider`), and the galley "Change File" always
    presets the file. No current screen was found rendering that link.
    Code read 2026-09-23 (U36 spec author; checkouts as above). Resolves:
    a live probe of the pending-revisions notice's surfaces, then
    maintainer confirmation as dead or a claim in the spec.
19. **Unlinked information ops, OMP's `contentOnly`, the contact page's
    `contactTitle`** — attached to **U07** (claimed; the
    journal-identity spec's notes u and v document them). OJS
    `InformationHandler` answers `competingInterestGuidelines` (reading
    the context setting `competingInterestsPolicy`) and OMP's answers
    `competingInterestPolicy` (reading `competingInterestPolicy`); no
    context schema of the three apps defines either setting, so the page
    is always empty. Both apps' `sampleCopyrightWording` op prints
    `manager.setup.copyrightNotice.sample`. No template, menu type,
    email or Vue component in the three checkouts links any of these
    ops (`grep -rn` over `.tpl`, `.php`, `.js`, `.vue`, `.xml`, `.json`
    outside the page handlers and `pages/information/index.php`). OMP's
    `contentOnly` request parameter (hides the header and footer of an
    information page) is set by nothing. `contact.tpl` prints
    `contactTitle`, which no form, schema property or API writes.
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (checkouts ojs 802202cb3e, omp 7f9455d5a,
    ops 15f0b6e0bd). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code
    (removal candidates).
20. **API-044 note delete unreachable and always refused** — attached to
    **U37** (claimed; the tasks-and-discussions spec's Reference table
    lists the route). `DELETE submissions/{id}/tasks/{taskId}/notes/{noteId}`
    has no caller in the ui-library (no screen offers deleting a message),
    and it cannot succeed: `NoteAccessPolicy` (write) denies every note
    that is not the head note, and `EditorialTaskController::deleteNote()`
    refuses the head note. Code-verified 2026-09-23 (U37 spec author;
    checkouts ojs `802202cb3e`, lib/pkp `5af3b3933`, ui-library
    `2034439a`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead (removal
    candidate), or a screen for deleting a reply with a policy that allows
    it.
21. **Unrendered discussions-manager pieces** — attached to **U37**
    (claimed). `useDiscussionManagerConfig.js` grants
    `TASKS_AND_DISCUSSIONS_SEARCH`, but nothing renders it and the store's
    `discussionSearch()` calls an action `useDiscussionManagerActions.js`
    does not define; the texts `task.reopenThisTask` /
    `task.confirmReopenTask` are reachable only through a box that is
    always disabled (the spec's register entry A13); and
    `editorialTask/Repository::countOpenPerStage()` has no caller.
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (checkouts as above). Resolves: maintainer
    confirmation as dead code.
22. **Unreachable activity-log pieces** — attached to **U38** (claimed;
    the activity-log spec's Reference table lists them). A note's
    attached-file download link (AFFW-692): `note.tpl` renders
    `$noteFileDownloadLink`, which no handler or form assigns, so no note
    ever shows it. The submissions list item's "Activity Log & Notes"
    button (`SubmissionsListItem.vue::openInfoCenter()`): every mount of
    `SubmissionsListPanel` (the native, PubMed and ONIX export plugins)
    replaces the item through its `item` slot, so the expanded item that
    holds the button never renders; the workflow header's "Activity Log"
    is the one door. API-018's `GET emails/{emailId}`
    (`PKPEmailController::getEmail()`): no ui-library caller (the
    author's "Notifications" list reads `emails/authorEmails` only).
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (U38 spec author; checkouts ojs
    `802202cb3e`, lib/pkp `5af3b3933`, ui-library `2034439a`; omp
    `7f9455d5a`; ops `15f0b6e0bd`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as
    dead code (removal candidates).
23. **Unrendered fallback menus and the legacy menu form** — attached to
    **U08** (claimed; the navigation-menus spec's Reference table
    documents the waiver). Each app's
    `templates/frontend/components/primaryNavMenu.tpl` (AFFR-004, AFFR-005,
    AFFR-006: a hand-written primary menu for a journal with none
    configured) is included by no template, page or plugin in any
    checkout: `header.tpl` renders only `{load_menu name="primary"}`,
    which draws nothing when no menu fills the area. The legacy
    `PKP\controllers\grid\navigationMenus\form\NavigationMenuForm` and
    `templates/controllers/grid/navigationMenus/form/navigationMenuForm.tpl`
    (named by AFFM-031) are instantiated nowhere since the grid opens the
    Vue `NavigationMenuManagerFormModal` (pkp-lib#12177, 2026-01-22); the
    items grid's `saveSequence` op has no ordering feature behind it.
    Code-verified 2026-09-23 (U08 spec author; checkouts ojs `802202cb3e`,
    omp `7f9455d5a`, ops `15f0b6e0bd`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation
    as dead code (removal candidates).
24. **Unreached library pieces** — attached to **U39** (claimed; the
    libraries spec's Reference table lists them). GRID-030
    `SelectableLibraryFileGridHandler` (a tick-box list of Publisher
    Library files): no template, handler or ui-library code loads
    `grid.files.SelectableLibraryFileGridHandler` (the email composer's
    "Library Files" reads the `_library` API instead). The legacy author
    dashboard's `submissionLibraryUrl`
    (`PKPAuthorDashboardHandler::setupTemplate()`): the page's
    `submission()` forwards to My Submissions before anything renders,
    so no screen uses it; the workflow header's "Library" is the one
    door. Code-verified 2026-09-24 (U39 spec author; checkouts ojs
    `802202cb3e`, lib/pkp `5af3b3933`, ui-library `2034439a`; omp
    `7f9455d5a`; ops `15f0b6e0bd`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as
    dead code (removal candidates).
25. **Unreached citation pieces** — attached to **U42** (claimed; the
    citations spec's Reference table lists them).
    `lib/ui-library/src/managers/CitationManager/CitationManagerMetadataLookup.vue`
    (a per-submission lookup switch) is imported by no component and binds
    `citationStore.formEnableLookup`, which the store never defines; the
    locale strings it would go with
    (`submission.citations.structured.enableModal.*`, `.disableModal.*`,
    `.enableCitationsMetadataLookup`) and the "Add" result messages
    (`submission.citations.structured.addRaw.*`) have no caller in
    ui-library or lib/pkp. The legacy author dashboard's references form
    (`PKPAuthorDashboardHandler::setupTemplate()`, `PKPCitationsForm` under
    `components.citations`): the page's `submission()` forwards to My
    Submissions before anything renders, so no screen shows it; the
    workflow's "References" page and the wizard's References box are the
    doors. Code-verified 2026-09-24 (U42 spec author; checkouts ojs
    `71bb244152`, omp `a36551804`, ops `07141ae4df`, lib/pkp
    `25182919bf`, ui-library `1afd40a9`). Resolves: maintainer
    confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).
26. **Unreached custom-page and static-page pieces** — attached to **U09**
    (claimed; the custom-pages spec's Reference table lists them). The
    `view` and `index` ops of `lib/pkp/pages/navigationMenu/` without a
    custom item (`NavigationMenuItemHandler::view()` returns `false` when
    no item was handed over; `index()` redirects there): no template,
    menu or JS links `navigationMenu/view`, the custom page being served
    at its own path through the `LoadHandler` hook. In the Static Pages
    plugin (OJS, OMP): `StaticPageGridHandler::index()` and
    `templates/staticPages.tpl` (the tab uses `staticPagesTab.tpl` and
    loads `fetchGrid` directly), and the locale strings `pageSaved`,
    `pageDeleted`, `editStaticPage`, `addNewPage`, `settingInstructions`,
    `editInstructions`, `noneExist` have no caller, while the form's
    `nameRequired` key has no string; in Custom Block Manager the
    `plugins.generic.customBlock.nameRegEx` string has no caller.
    Code-verified 2026-09-24 (U09 spec author; checkouts ojs

    `25182919bf`, staticPages `45d02c0`, customBlockManager `1f8d452`).
    Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).
27. **Unreached identifier pieces** — attached to **U44** (claimed; the
    identifiers spec's Reference table lists them). OPS
    `controllers/grid/pubIds/form/AssignPublicIdentifiersForm.php` and
    `templates/controllers/grid/pubIds/form/assignPublicIdentifiersForm.tpl`
    (AFFW-607): no OPS handler builds the form. The OJS template's
    `PKPSubmission` branch posts to `tab.issueEntry.IssueEntryTabHandler`
    `assignPubIds`, a handler that exists in no app (AFFW-605's live
    half is the issue branch, "Publish Issue"). The submission branch of
    each app's `publicIdentifiersForm.tpl` (the article's identifiers
    moved to the Vue "Identifiers" page). OJS and OPS
    `ManageFileApiHandler` `identifiers` / `updateIdentifiers` /
    `clearPubId` (GRID-067, GRID-100): `editMetadata.tpl` shows its
    "Identifiers" tab only when `showIdentifierTab` is assigned, which only
    OMP's subclass does, so no OJS or OPS screen opens them (a typed
    address still reaches them). OJS `issueForm.tpl`'s `$pubIdPlugins`
    loop (`IssueForm` never assigns the variable) and the OJS
    `PubIdPlugin::manage()` verb `assignPubIds` (no URN screen posts
    it). Code-verified 2026-09-24 (U44 spec author; checkouts ojs
    `71bb244152`, omp `a365518044`, ops `07141ae4df`, lib/pkp
    `25182919bf`, ui-library `1afd40a911`). Resolves: maintainer
    confirmation as dead code (removal candidates).
28. **Unreached galley-grid pieces** — attached to **U46** (claimed; the
    galleys spec's Reference table notes them). OJS
    `ArticleGalleyGridHandler`'s rendering operations (`fetchGrid`,
    `fetchRow` with its `uploadFile` event), `ArticleGalleyGridRow`'s row
    actions ("Edit a Layout Galley" / "View Galley", the upload action,
    "Delete") and `ArticleGalleyGridCellProvider`, the grid's own "Add
    galley" link and `js/controllers/grid/articleGalleys/ArticleGalleyGridHandler.js`:
    loaded only through `representationsGridUrl`, which the retired
    author dashboard (`PKPAuthorDashboardHandler`) assigns and no current
    screen reads; the workflow's "Galleys" page (`GalleyManager`) calls
    only the edit, delete and ordering operations. OPS's copies stay live
    in the submission wizard's "Upload Files" step (`templates/submission/galleys.tpl`,
    U21); OPS `WorkflowHandler::_getRepresentationsGridUrl()` has no
    caller. The `galleyView` window's heading `submission.layout.viewGalley`
    is reached on OPS only (an OJS Author has no row menu). Code-verified
    2026-09-24 (U46 spec author; checkouts ojs `71bb244152`, ops
    `07141ae4df`, lib/pkp `25182919bf`, ui-library `1afd40a9`). Resolves:
    maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates on OJS).
29. **Unreached media-file pieces** — attached to **U47** (claimed; the
    media-files spec's Reference table notes them). The
    `variantGroupIds` and `variantTypes` query filters of
    `MediaFilesController::getMany()` (API-041): the "Media" page fetches
    the whole list and no screen passes either. The `canEdit` value
    `workflowConfigEditorialOJS.js` passes to `MediaFileManager` (AFFW-420):
    the component declares no such prop, so it falls through as an
    attribute and nothing reads it (the root of the spec's A1). OPS
    `PreprintHandler::download()`'s admission of a publication's media
    file ids for a galley: OPS installs no HTML galley renderer, so no
    page produces such an address (the spec's OPS1; pending the claim
    check's drive). Code-verified 2026-09-24 (U47 spec author; checkouts
    ojs `71bb244152`, omp `a36551804`, ops `07141ae4df`, lib/pkp
    `25182919bf`, ui-library `1afd40a9`). Resolves: maintainer
    confirmation as dead code (removal candidates), or the OPS1 ruling.
30. **Unmounted landing-page display components** — attached to **U13**
    (AFFR-056, ROUTE-033; claimed). OJS `ArticleHandler::view()` builds an
    `OpenReviewComponent` configuration, locale keys and icons for every
    article page, but no template mounts an open-review display
    (`PkpOpenReview*` in ui-library `src/frontend/components/` is mounted
    by no OJS or OPS template, as API-030 above records for `PkpCite`
    too); the page's "Downloads" chart is drawn by
    `lib/pkp/js/usage-stats-chart.js`, and ui-library's
    `PkpUsageChart.vue` is mounted nowhere. Code-verified 2026-09-24 (U13
    spec author; checkouts ojs `d9b567efec`, ops `61cd158ce3`, lib/pkp
    `76a315591b`, ui-library `03d1cee2d2`). Resolves: maintainer
    confirmation as pre-release machinery or dead code.
31. **Unreached JATS and Body Text pieces** — attached to **U48**
    (claimed; the JATS & Body Text spec's Reference tables note them).
    `PKPWorkflowHandler::getJatsPanel()` and
    `PKP\components\PublicationSectionJats` (AFFW-403's legacy twin): OJS
    `WorkflowHandler` still builds the panel's config into the page's
    `components`, but no Vue component or template reads it; the page's
    "JATS XML" is `WorkflowPublicationJats`. The Body Text API's `DELETE`
    (API-009): no screen calls it (the page only reads and saves). The
    "JATS Template Plugin"'s `jatsTemplate/download` page operation
    (`JatsTemplateDownloadHandler`, PLUG-019; manager or subscription
    manager, Production-ready files): no screen links it, it serves
    API-key clients only. Code-verified 2026-09-25 (U48 spec author;
    checkouts ojs `71bb244152`, lib/pkp `76a315591`, ui-library
    `03d1cee2`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal
    candidates), or a ruling that the download op is an external
    interface.
32. **Categories API form route with no method** — attached to **U16**
    (API-010; claimed; the Categories spec's Reference tables note it).
    `CategoryCategoryController::getGroupRoutes()` registers `GET
    categories/categoryFormComponent` to `$this->getCategoryFormComponent(...)`,
    a method no class in the chain defines (Laravel's `Controller::__call()`
    lets the route register and would answer a server error when called);
    no screen calls it, the tab gets its form from the page
    (`ManagementHandler::context()`). Also: the category `fullSize` page
    op (lib/pkp `PKPCatalogHandler`, OMP `CatalogHandler`) is linked from
    no page in any app (the category page's picture sits in a `div`, the
    Categories spec's A6). Code-verified
    2026-09-25 (U16 spec author; checkouts lib/pkp `76a315591b`, omp
    `187f0f40d`). Resolves: maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal
    candidate), or the route's method restored.
33. **Unused series fields** — attached to **U17** (SET-038, AFFM-009;
    claimed; the Sections spec's footnotes note them). OMP's
    `schemas/section.json` carries `featured` and `reviewFormId` for a
    series: `SeriesForm::readInputData()` reads `featured`, but no field
    of `seriesForm.tpl` posts it, so every save stores it off, and nothing
    in OMP reads `Section::getFeatured()`; no series field sets
    `reviewFormId`, which `ReviewerForm::initData()` would read for a
    press's default review form. Code-verified 2026-09-25 (U17 spec
    author; checkouts omp `187f0f40d`, lib/pkp `76a315591b`). Resolves:
    maintainer confirmation as dead code (removal candidates), or a field
    added to the series window.
