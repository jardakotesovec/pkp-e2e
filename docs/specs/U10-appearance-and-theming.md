# Appearance & theming

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

A journal's managers decide how its public site looks and what its home
page holds. On Settings › Website they choose the theme and its options
(the fonts, the header's colour, what the home page shows), upload a logo,
a homepage image, a favicon and a style sheet of their own, write the
page footer and extra text for the home page, choose which blocks stand
in the sidebar of the public pages and in what order, order the roles on
the public masthead, and set how long lists run before they page and how
dates and times are written. Every visitor meets the result on every
public page of the journal. The Site Administrator can also set a
journal's theme from the journal's Settings Wizard. The look of the
site's own pages (the site's home page and the pages outside any journal)
is set on Administration › Site Settings, which *Site settings*
describes. <sup>a</sup>

## Actors & permissions

Who opens the Settings pages, and what every other role gets there, is set
out in [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md#settings-access):
the manager-level roles of the journal whose role allows changes to
Settings, and the Site Administrator. This spec calls them "whoever opens
the Settings pages". On a press or a preprint server the Site
Administrator opens them only through a manager-level role held there,
and without one gets the access-denied page
([Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md#a1));
on a journal, an administrator with no role there gets Settings ›
Website under an "Error" window reading "The current role does not have
access to this operation." ([Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md#a9)).
A Site Administrator with no role in the journal still changes its theme
from the Settings Wizard (Rule 34). Visitors need no account. <sup>a</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Change and save the "Appearance" tabs ("Theme", "Setup", "Editorial Masthead", "Advanced") and the "Lists" and "Date & Time" tabs** (Settings › Website) | • whoever opens the Settings pages; nobody else <sup>a</sup> <sup>td1</sup> |
| **Change a journal's theme from its Settings Wizard** (Administration › Hosted Journals, the journal's "Settings wizard", "Appearance"; Rule 34) | • the Site Administrator alone <sup>b</sup> <sup>td2</sup> |
| **See the result** (the home page, and the header, footer and sidebar of every public page of the journal) | • any visitor, signed in or not; on a journal that requires visitors to sign in, or that is not enabled, a signed-out visitor gets the Login page instead ([Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md), Rule 22) <sup>a</sup> |

## Fields & validation

The tabs this spec describes sit on Settings › Website. The top tab
"Appearance" holds the side tabs "Theme", "Setup", "Editorial Masthead"
and "Advanced"; the top tab "Setup" holds, among side tabs other features
describe, "Lists" and "Date & Time" (the full list of who describes which
tab is in [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md),
Rule 2). Each side tab is one form with a "Save" button at its foot. A
refused save, the "Saved" note beside the button and the language buttons
of a journal with a second form language work as on Settings › Journal,
which [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md)
describes. A field marked "per language" takes a value in each form
language (Rule 3). <sup>c</sup>

**The upload boxes.** "Logo", the thumbnail, "Homepage Image", "Favicon"
and the style sheet are upload boxes: "Upload File", or a file dropped on
"Drop files here to upload". A picture then shows as a small preview with an
"Alternate text" box beside it and the guidance "Describe this image for
visitors viewing the site in a text-only browser or with assistive
devices. Example: "Our editor speaking at the PKP conference.""; a style
sheet shows its file name. "Remove" empties the box. While a picture box
holds a picture it shows no "Upload File" and no drop area, so a new
picture goes in by the mouse only once "Remove" has emptied the box. The
box keeps its "Upload File" for keyboard and screen-reader users: on a
page opened with a saved picture, that hidden button takes the
keyboard's focus, Enter on it opens the file chooser, and the chosen
picture takes the old one's place. On a box that opened with a saved
file, removing or replacing that file adds "Restore Original", which
brings back the saved file and its alternate text; a box that opened
empty has no "Restore Original". A picture that replaces a saved one
arrives with an empty "Alternate text" box; saved as it is, the new
picture has no description. A file of a type the box does not take is
refused in the box ("You can't upload files of this type.") and nothing
is sent; after a refusal made with "Upload File", that button and the
tab's "Save" stay disabled ⚠ [A7](#a7). An upload counts only once the
tab is saved. <sup>d</sup> <sup>td3</sup>

**"Theme"** (Settings › Website › "Appearance" › "Theme"; the page opens
on this tab). On a journal the fields follow "Theme" in the order below; a
preprint server has the same fields without "Journal Content
Organization"; a press shows "Typography", "Press Summary", "Header
Background Image", "Colour", "Show Series" and "Usage statistics display
options", in that order. <sup>e</sup>

**"Lists"** (Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Lists"). <sup>i</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Items per page" | yes | A small box under "Limit the number of items (for example, submissions, users, or editing assignments) to show in a list before showing subsequent items in another page."; 25 on a new journal. A whole number of 1 or more: emptied, "Save" is refused before anything is sent with "This field is required."; "0" and a negative number are refused with "This must be at least 1."; text or a decimal with "This is not a valid integer."

**"Date & Time"** (Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Date & Time"). Under
the heading "Date and Time Formats" and the sentence "Choose the preferred
format for dates and times. A custom format can be entered using the
special format characters." (the last two words a link to a page
explaining those characters), five groups of choices, each per language.
Each choice but the last is written as today's date and time in its
pattern, by the clock of the manager's own computer; the last is "Custom"
with a box for a pattern of one's own. The examples below are for 24
September 2026 at 3:05 in the afternoon. <sup>j</sup> <sup>td7</sup>

## Rules & state

**The tabs**

1. **Where they are.** Settings › Website opens on "Appearance" ›
   "Theme". The "Theme", "Setup", "Editorial Masthead", "Advanced",
   "Lists" and "Date & Time" tabs belong to the journal the page was
   opened in; a second journal on the same site has its own set. <sup>c</sup>
2. **Saving and leaving.** "Save" stores the fields of its own tab and
   nothing else, shows "Saved" beside the button, and the public pages
   show the change from their next load. A change left unsaved behaves
   as on every Settings page ([Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md),
   Rule 5): it waits in its box while the manager moves between the
   side tabs, and is gone without a question once the page is left, so
   a "Page Footer" typed and not saved is not there after the next load.
   The same holds on "Theme": a changed choice is still there when the
   manager opens another side tab and comes back, and "Save" then
   stores it. <sup>c</sup> <sup>td8</sup>
3. **Languages.** With a second form language (Settings › Website ›
   "Setup" › "Languages", "Forms"; *Languages & locales*), each field
   marked "per language" takes a value in each language, and each group
   on "Date & Time" is chosen once per language. A visitor sees the
   logo (with its alternate text), homepage image, favicon, "Page
   Footer" and "Additional Content" of their own language; where it has
   none, the primary language's; where that has none either, another
   language's (an English visitor reads a French-only "Page Footer").
   Dates print in the formats chosen for the visitor's language.
   <sup>y</sup> <sup>td9</sup>

**The theme**

4. **The theme.** The theme chosen under "Theme" draws every public page
   of the journal; the editorial screens do not change with it. It also
   names the menu areas a navigation menu can fill
   ([Navigation menus & site chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md),
   Rule 8). A stock install has "Default Theme" alone, so the list
   offers no other choice; further themes are installed and enabled as
   plugins (*Plugins management*). Rules 5 to 10 describe the default
   theme's fields. <sup>k</sup> <sup>td10</sup>
5. **"Typography".** After "Save", the text and the headings of the
   public pages use the chosen fonts: a single name sets both; a pair
   ("Noto Serif/Noto Sans") sets the headings to the first and the text
   to the second. The journal's name in the header, shown while no logo
   is set, takes the headings' font. <sup>l</sup> <sup>td11</sup>
6. **"Colour".** After "Save", the header of every public page (the band
   holding the logo or the journal's name and the primary menu) takes the
   chosen colour. With a light colour the header's text turns dark so it
   stays readable. A code the colour box cannot read as a colour
   ("red", "#12345") stays in the box but changes nothing: "Save" shows
   "Saved" and keeps the colour chosen before. <sup>l</sup> <sup>td11</sup>
7. **The summary on the home page.** Ticked, the home page gains a
   section headed "About the Journal" ("About the Press", "About the
   Server") holding the "Journal Summary" text of Settings › Journal ›
   "Masthead" ([Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md),
   Rule 8), and the skip link to it
   ([Navigation menus & site chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md),
   Rule 22). Where the section sits: Rule 12. <sup>m</sup> <sup>td12</sup>
8. **"Header Background Image".** Ticked while a "Homepage Image" is set,
   the picture fills the background of the header on every public page
   of the journal, and the home page no longer shows it in its body
   (Rule 18). Ticked with no homepage image, nothing changes.
   <sup>q</sup> <sup>td13</sup>
9. **"Usage statistics display options".** A chart choice adds a section
   headed "Downloads" to each article's landing page, holding a bar or a
   line chart of its downloads by month; an article with no downloads
   yet shows an empty chart. The landing-page features (*Article landing
   page & reading*, on a press *Monograph landing page*) describe the
   section. <sup>z</sup> <sup>td14</sup>
10. **"Journal Content Organization"** {OJS}. Each ticked box adds a part
    to the home page (Rule 12): the current issue (Rule 14), the recent
    articles (Rule 13), the categories (Rule 15). Until the tab is saved,
    which boxes count as ticked depends on the journal: with at least one
    issue, published or not, "Include the current issue's table of
    contents" alone; with no issue, "Include recent most published
    articles" alone. A journal that never saved the tab therefore changes
    its home page by itself when its first issue is created
    ⚠ [OJS2](#ojs2). A save with none of the three ticked shows "Saved"
    but keeps no choice: the tab reopens with that default ticked, and
    the home page shows that part ⚠ [OJS5](#ojs5). <sup>o</sup>
    <sup>td15</sup>

**The home page**

11. **One page per journal.** The journal's home page is its address
    with nothing after the journal's path; the header's logo or name
    leads there. Its parts are this feature's, except the carousel
    ([Highlights](U11-highlights.md)) and the announcements
    ([Announcements](U12-announcements.md)), which sit in it. <sup>m</sup>
12. **What it shows, top to bottom.** Each part shows only while its
    condition holds. A journal or press with nothing set and nothing
    published shows the header, the footer and an empty page between
    them; a preprint server's shows its search box and the "Latest
    preprints" heading. <sup>m</sup> <sup>td16</sup>

    | Journal {OJS} | Press {OMP} | Preprint server {OPS} |
    |---|---|---|
    | the carousel | the carousel | the carousel |
    | the homepage image (Rule 18) | the homepage image | the homepage image |
    | the categories (Rule 15) | "About the Press" (Rule 7) | the announcements |
    | "About the Journal" (Rule 7) | "Featured": books featured in the catalog, while "Featured Books" is ticked ([OMP1](#omp1)) | a search box and the category links (*Sections*) |
    | the announcements | "New Releases": books marked as new releases, while "New Releases" is ticked | "Latest preprints" (Rule 16) |
    | "Latest Publications" (Rule 13) | the announcements | "About the Server" (Rule 7) |
    | "Current Issue" (Rule 14) | "Additional Content" (Rule 19) | "Additional Content" |
    | "Additional Content" (Rule 19) | | |

    A preprint server's page is fixed in this order, with no choice of
    its parts but the summary [OPS1](#ops1).
13. **"Latest Publications"** {OJS}. Under this heading, the journal's
    published articles that are not in a published issue (published with
    no issue, or assigned to an issue not yet published), the most
    recently submitted first, each shown as its article summary
    (*Article landing page & reading*) ⚠ [OJS3](#ojs3); to a screen
    reader each title is a heading of the section's own level
    ⚠ [OJS6](#ojs6). Under the list "{from} - {to} of {total} items"
    ("1 - 2 of 2 items"), and, with more
    articles than "Items per page", page links: "<<" and "<" when not on
    the first page, the page numbers (Rule 30), then ">" and ">>" when not
    on the last. With no such article the section is absent. <sup>n</sup>
    <sup>td17</sup>
14. **"Current Issue"** {OJS}. Under this heading, the current issue's
    name ("Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)"), its table of contents (*Issues*), and
    the link "View All Issues" to the archive. It shows while the journal
    has a current issue and Settings › Distribution › "Access" ›
    "Publishing Mode" is not "OJS will not be used to publish the
    journal's contents online." (*Subscriptions & open access control*).
    <sup>o</sup> <sup>td18</sup>
15. **The categories** {OJS}. A row of links, one per top-level category
    of the journal, each opening that category's page (*Categories*);
    subcategories are not listed. With no category the row is absent.
    <sup>o</sup> <sup>td19</sup>
16. **"Latest preprints"** {OPS}. The heading shows always, even with
    nothing posted. Under it, up to ten posted preprints, the most
    recently posted day first, each shown as its preprint summary
    (*Article landing page & reading*), with no page links: "Items per
    page" does not apply. Preprints posted on the same day come in no
    fixed order, so on a day with more than ten posts which ten show is
    not fixed. <sup>p</sup> <sup>td20</sup>
17. **Featured books and new releases** {OMP}. Which books are featured or
    marked as new releases is set on the catalog (*Catalog management*),
    and so is the order of the featured ones ("Order Features"); the new
    releases come newest first by publication date. The "Setup" boxes
    only show or hide the two lists. A ticked box with no book to show
    adds nothing. <sup>m</sup> <sup>td4</sup>
18. **The homepage image.** Unless "Header Background Image" is ticked
    (Rule 8), the "Homepage Image" shows under the carousel. On a journal
    it is stretched or shrunk to the full width of the page's main
    column; on a press and a preprint server it shows at the size it was
    uploaded, shrunk to fit when wider. A journal gives it the "Alternate
    text" as its description, and with the box empty gives it no text
    alternative at all ⚠ [OJS7](#ojs7); a press and a preprint server
    show it with an empty description, whatever was typed ⚠ [A1](#a1).
    <sup>q</sup> <sup>td21</sup>
19. **"Additional Content".** The text shows at the foot of the home page,
    after every other part, and on no other page. <sup>m</sup>
    <sup>td22</sup>

**Logo, thumbnail and footer**

20. **"Logo".** Set, the logo stands in the header of every public page of
    the journal in place of the journal's name, as a link to the home page
    ([Navigation menus & site chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md),
    Rule 15a), at the size it was uploaded up to 80 pixels high; a
    taller logo is scaled down to that height (a 1600 × 160 logo shows
    at 800 × 80). Its "Alternate text" is its description; without one
    the logo has none, and the link has no name a screen reader can read
    ⚠ [A2](#a2). Removed and saved, the name comes back. <sup>r</sup>
    <sup>td23</sup>
21. **The thumbnail.** Set, it shows beside the journal in the list of
    journals on the site's home page, with its "Alternate text" as its
    description (*Hosted journals* describes the list). <sup>r</sup>
    <sup>td24</sup>
22. **"Page Footer".** Set, the text shows at the foot of every public
    page of the journal, above the application's logo
    ([Navigation menus & site chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md),
    Rule 20). <sup>r</sup> <sup>td25</sup>

**The sidebar**

23. **What "Sidebar" offers.** One box per block of a plugin that is
    enabled in the journal (Settings › Website › "Plugins" › "Installed
    Plugins"; *Plugins management*), labelled with the plugin's name; a
    custom block's box reads the block's name followed by "(Custom
    Block)", while the sidebar shows its title. A new journal offers "Web
    Feed Plugin", "Information Block", "Subscription Block" and "Language
    Toggle Block"; a press offers "Browse Block" in place of
    "Subscription Block"; a preprint server offers "Web Feed Plugin" and
    "Language Toggle Block" alone. ""Make a Submission" Block" is not
    among them: its plugin is disabled on a new journal and press
    (Settings bullet 23). Enabling a plugin with a block adds its box, and
    a custom block adds one per block
    ([Custom pages & blocks](U09-custom-pages-and-blocks.md), Rule 18). No
    box is ticked on a new journal. The ticked boxes come first, in their
    sidebar order, and the unticked ones after them, so a block added
    later joins the unticked ones. Dragging a row or pressing its up or
    down arrow moves it; a screen reader hears the arrows as "Increase
    position of {block}" and "Decrease position of {block}" ⚠ [A3](#a3).
    <sup>s</sup> <sup>td26</sup>
24. **Placing.** After "Save", every ticked block shows, in the list's
    order, in the sidebar beside the content of every public page of the
    journal; an unticked block shows nowhere. A block with nothing to
    show adds nothing (the "Language Toggle Block" on a journal with one
    interface language). With no block ticked the public pages have no
    sidebar; the content keeps its width and stands in the middle of the
    page. What each block holds belongs to the block's own feature:
    <sup>s</sup> <sup>td26</sup>

    | Block | Described in |
    |---|---|
    | "Information Block" {OJS OMP} | [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md) |

25. **A placed block whose plugin is disabled.** It leaves the sidebar and
    the "Sidebar" list at once, and keeps its place: enabled again, it is
    back in its place, unless "Setup" was saved in between with a changed
    "Sidebar" list, which drops the place and brings it back unticked.
    Meanwhile, "Save" on "Setup" with the "Sidebar" list untouched is
    refused under "Sidebar" with "The {name} block can not be found.
    Please make sure the plugin is installed and enabled." ⚠ [A4](#a4),
    where {name} is the block's internal name, not its label ("The
    languagetoggleblockplugin block can not be found. …"; for a custom
    block, its name). <sup>s</sup> <sup>td27</sup>

**Style sheet and favicon**

26. **The style sheet.** After "Save", the uploaded file is loaded on
    every public page of the journal after the theme's own styles, so its
    rules win over the theme's where they are as specific: a rule for
    every heading turns the home page's headings red, while an article
    page's "Published" label keeps the theme's grey. The editorial
    screens do not load it.
    "Remove" and "Save" take it off the pages, but the file itself stays
    where it was, still opening at its address ⚠ [A5](#a5). <sup>t</sup>
    <sup>td28</sup>
27. **"Favicon".** Set, it is the icon in the browser's tab on every public
    page and every editorial screen of the journal. Without one, the tab
    shows the browser's own default icon. <sup>t</sup> <sup>td29</sup>

**The masthead order**

28. **"Editorial Masthead".** The list holds every role of the journal
    whose "Consider role in masthead list" is ticked (Settings › Users &
    Roles › "Roles"; *Roles configuration*), the Reviewer role excepted:
    on a new journal "Journal editor", "Section editor" and "Editorial
    Board Member" ("Press editor", "Series editor" and "Editorial Board
    Member" on a press; "Moderator" and "Editorial Board Member" on a
    preprint server). Until the tab is first saved, the list follows the
    roles' permission levels, a newly ticked role included; once it has
    been saved, a role ticked later joins at the end. After "Save", the
    list's order is the order of the role
    headings on the public "Editorial Masthead" and "Editorial History"
    pages ([Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md),
    Rule 14a). The arrows' names for a screen reader: [A3](#a3).
    <sup>u</sup> <sup>td30</sup>

**Lists**

29. **"Items per page".** The number of entries a list shows before it
    pages, on the lists that page: the listing pages of
    [Navigation menus & site chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md)
    (Rule 24), the home page's "Latest Publications" {OJS} (Rule 13), the
    results of the Search page ([Search](U15-search.md)) and a category's
    page (*Categories*); on a press a category's page shows only its first
    page ⚠ [OMP2](#omp2). It is also the number of rows the older
    editorial lists start with before they page, such as Settings › Users
    & Roles › "Roles" (*Roles configuration*); the "Users" list there
    shows 25 a page whatever the number (*Users management*).
    <sup>v</sup> <sup>td31</sup>
30. **"Page links".** The most page numbers a list shows at once, on the
    lists that number their pages: the home page's "Latest Publications"
    {OJS}, the Search page's results, a category's page on a journal
    and a preprint server, and Settings › Users & Roles › "Roles". The
    current page's number sits in the middle of them when there are pages
    on both sides. The listing pages with "Previous" and "Next" do not
    use it. <sup>v</sup> <sup>td32</sup>

**Dates and times**

31. **Where the formats print.** The feature that owns each page
    describes the date it prints; a changed format shows there from the
    next load. <sup>w</sup> <sup>td33</sup>
    - "Date (Short)": an article's date on its landing page and in its
      "Versions" list, an issue's date {OJS}, the date of each
      announcement ([Announcements](U12-announcements.md)), the dates in
      a preprint's summary {OPS}, and an article's date in the Search
      page's results {OJS}.
    - "Date" {OMP}: a book's "Published" date on its page and its date
      in the catalog's and the Search page's lists; the book's
      "Versions" list uses "Date (Short)".
    - "Date & Time (Short)": the date and time of a submission file's
      notes and a library file's "Date uploaded".
32. **The two combined choices follow the others.** On the tab, choosing
    another "Date", "Date (Short)" or "Time" rewrites the ready choice of
    "Date & Time" or "Date & Time (Short)" to the new combination, and a
    combined group that was on its ready choice moves with it. Choosing
    the first "Date (Short)" back brings the combined choice back too,
    and "Save" stores the two in step. A combined group on "Custom"
    stays there; only its ready choice's label follows. <sup>j</sup>
    <sup>td34</sup>
33. **"Custom".** Choosing "Custom" and typing a pattern in its box
    ("d/m/Y") saves that pattern, and the dates print in it. A "Custom"
    left with an empty box saves no format, and the dates print in the
    installation's default for that group (Settings bullet 27). Under
    "Date (Short)" that save also leaves the editorial dates showing the
    time without the date ⚠ [A9](#a9). <sup>j</sup> <sup>td35</sup>

**The Settings Wizard**

34. **Its "Appearance" tab.** The Site Administrator's Settings Wizard of
    a journal is reached from Administration › Hosted Journals: the
    journal's row's arrow offers "Edit", "Remove" and "Settings wizard".
    The wizard's top tabs are "Journal Settings" ("Setup" on a press,
    "Server Settings" on a preprint server), "Plugins" and "Users"; the
    first holds the side tabs "Journal" ("Press", "Server"),
    "Appearance", "Languages", "Search Indexing" and "Restrict Bulk
    Emails". "Appearance" holds the fields of the journal's own "Theme"
    tab (Fields), and a save there changes the journal as a save on its
    own tab does. A change there is kept while another of the wizard's
    side tabs is open, and dropped without a question when the page is
    reloaded or left. Every tab but "Appearance" is *Hosted journals*'s.
    On a journal with no issue, the wizard shows "Include the current
    issue's table of contents" ticked where the journal's own tab shows
    "Include recent most published articles", and a save there stores
    what the wizard shows ⚠ [OJS4](#ojs4). <sup>x</sup> <sup>td36</sup>

**Other languages of the interface**

35. **French.** In the French interface the "Theme" tab shows raw codes in
    place of some labels ⚠ [A6](#a6): on a journal the "Journal Content
    Organization" field, its description and its three boxes; on a press
    the only entry of the "Thème" list and every label, description and
    choice of the default theme's fields, "Press Summary" included; on a
    preprint server "Usage statistics display options" and its three
    choices. <sup>td37</sup>

## Side effects

- None beyond the pages themselves: saving these tabs sends no email,
  creates no notification and writes no line to any log a manager can
  read. <sup>c</sup>
- Uploaded pictures and the style sheet are stored as public files of the
  journal, reachable by their address by anyone; "Remove" and "Save"
  delete a picture's file, and leave the style sheet's in place
  ([A5](#a5)). <sup>d</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

    Plugins"; enabled on a new journal: the blocks Rule 23 lists;
    disabled: ""Developed By" Block", ""Make a Submission" Block"
    {OJS OMP} and, on a journal and a preprint server, "Browse Block").
    Enabled or disabled: Rules 23, 25.

    journal's contents online.": no "Current Issue" on the home page
    (Rule 14). *Subscriptions & open access control* owns it. <sup>o</sup>
26. **"Forms"** (Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Languages"; the primary
    language alone on a new journal). Each language added: a value per
    language on the per-language fields (Rule 3). *Languages & locales*

## Canonical scenarios

Every scenario changes a setting, so all of them run on scratch journals
(scratch presses, scratch preprint servers) with a throwaway Journal
Manager, the Site Administrator joining in scenario 2, and a signed-out
visitor reads the public pages in a second browser; the accounts, their
passwords and the tooling recipe are in the footnote. <sup>sc</sup>

1. **A new journal's home page, its summary, its additional content and a style sheet**

   Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal with nothing published
   whose "Journal Summary" (Settings › Journal › "Masthead") reads "A
   journal for testing.", a visitor, signed out, in a second browser,
   and two files: "red-headings.css", a style sheet whose one rule
   colours every heading red, and "picture.png", a PNG picture.

   - **The home page, nothing set**: the visitor opens the journal's
     address: the header, the footer and an empty page between them; on
     a preprint server, a search box and the heading "Latest preprints"
     with nothing under it (Rules 11, 12, 16).
   - **The "Theme" tab as it opens**: open Settings › Website: the page
     opens on "Appearance" › "Theme" (Rule 1), and "Theme" offers
     "Default Theme" alone (Rule 4). On a journal the fields below it
     read, in this order, "Typography", "Colour", "Journal Summary",
     "Journal Content Organization", "Header Background Image" and "Usage
     statistics display options"; a preprint server shows the same
     without "Journal Content Organization"; a press shows "Typography",
     "Press Summary", "Header Background Image", "Colour", "Show Series"
     and "Usage statistics display options". "Noto Sans: A digital-native
     font designed by Google for extensive language support." is chosen,
     the colour box reads "#1E6292", "Show the journal summary on the
     homepage." ("…the press summary…", "…the server summary…") and "Show
     the homepage image as the header background." are unticked, "Do not
     display submission usage statistics chart for reader." is chosen,
     and on a press "Add list of links to all of the press's series on
     the catalog page" is unticked (Fields, "Theme").
   - **The summary**: tick "Show the journal summary on the homepage."
     and press "Save": "Saved" shows beside the button. The visitor
     reloads the home page: a section headed "About the Journal" ("About
     the Press", "About the Server") holds "A journal for testing.", and
     the page's skip links gain one to it (Rule 7).
   - **"Additional Content"**: open "Advanced", type "Welcome text" in
     "Additional Content" and press "Save". The visitor reloads: "Welcome
     text" stands at the foot of the home page, after "About the
     Journal"; the "About the Journal" page, opened from the header's
     "About" menu, does not show it (Rules 12, 19).
   - **The style sheet**: press "Upload File" under "Journal style sheet"
     ("Press style sheet", "Server style sheet") and choose
     "red-headings.css": the box shows "red-headings.css" and "Remove";
     press "Save": "Saved", and the box still reads "red-headings.css".
     Reload the page and open "Advanced": the box shows "styleSheet.css",
     a link to the stored file, and "Remove" (Fields, "Advanced"). The
     visitor reloads the home page: the heading "About the Journal" is
     red. No heading on the Journal Manager's Dashboard turns red
     (Rule 26).
   - **Removed**: press "Remove" and "Save". The visitor reloads: "About
     the Journal" is back in the theme's colour [A5](#a5) (Rule 26).
   - **A file the box does not take**: drop "picture.png" on the empty
     style sheet box: "You can't upload files of this type." shows in the
     box and nothing is sent (Fields, the upload boxes).
   - **Control**: before the summary box was ticked, the visitor's home
     page showed "A journal for testing." nowhere (Rule 7).

2. **The fonts, the header's colour and the favicon, from the journal and from the Settings Wizard**

   Given: Journal Manager and the Site Administrator, on a scratch
   journal, a visitor, signed out, in a second browser, and two files:
   "icon.png", a PNG picture, and "photo.jpg", a JPEG picture.

   - **Kept across side tabs**: on Settings › Website › "Appearance" ›
     "Theme" choose "Lora/Open Sans: A complimentary pairing with serif
     headings and sans-serif body text." under "Typography", open the
     side tab "Setup" and come back to "Theme": the choice is still marked
     (Rule 2).
   - **"Typography"**: press "Save": "Saved". The visitor reloads the
     home page: the journal's name in the header is in Lora and the text
     in Open Sans; on a preprint server the heading "Latest preprints" is
     in Lora too. The visitor opens "About the Journal" from the header's
     "About" menu: its heading "About the Journal" is in Lora and the text
     in Open Sans (Rule 5).
   - **"Colour", light**: type "#FFFF00" in the colour box under
     "Colour" and press "Save". The visitor reloads the home page, then
     opens "About the Journal" from the header's "About" menu: on both,
     the header (the band holding the journal's name and the primary
     menu) is yellow and its text dark (Rule 6).
   - **"Colour", dark**: type "#000080" and press "Save": the visitor's
     reloaded header is navy blue (Rule 6).
   - **A code the box cannot read**: type "red" in the colour box and
     press "Save": "Saved" shows, and the visitor's reloaded header stays
     navy blue (Rule 6).
   - **A file the favicon box does not take**: open "Advanced" and drop
     "photo.jpg" on "Favicon": "You can't upload files of this type."
     shows in the box and nothing is sent. Reload the page and open
     "Advanced" again: "Favicon" is empty (Fields, "Advanced"; Rule 2).
   - **"Favicon"**: press "Upload File" under "Favicon", choose
     "icon.png" and press "Save". The visitor reloads the home page: the
     browser tab's icon is "icon.png"; the Journal Manager's browser tab
     on the Dashboard shows it too (Rule 27).
   - **The Site Administrator's wizard**: sign in as the Site
     Administrator, open Administration › Hosted Journals and press the
     arrow of the journal's row: it offers "Edit", "Remove" and "Settings
     wizard". Choose "Settings wizard": the top tabs read "Journal
     Settings" ("Setup" on a press, "Server Settings" on a preprint
     server), "Plugins" and "Users", and the first holds the side tabs
     "Journal" ("Press", "Server"), "Appearance", "Languages", "Search
     Indexing" and "Restrict Bulk Emails" (Rule 34).
   - **Unsaved in the wizard**: open "Appearance": it holds the fields of
     the journal's "Theme" tab. Type "#1B5E20" in the colour box, open
     "Journal" and come back: the box still reads "#1B5E20". Reload the
     page: no question is asked; open "Appearance" again: the box no
     longer reads "#1B5E20" (Rule 34).
   - **Saved in the wizard**: type "#1B5E20" again and press "Save". The
     visitor reloads: the header is dark green. The Journal Manager
     reloads the "Theme" tab: the colour box reads "#1B5E20" (Rule 34).
     On a journal with no issue the same save also stores "Include the
     current issue's table of contents" [OJS4](#ojs4).
   - **Control**: through every save, the Journal Manager's Dashboard
     kept its own header colour and fonts (Rule 4).

3. **The logo, the thumbnail, the homepage image and the page footer**

   Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal, a visitor, signed out,
   in a second browser, and four PNG pictures: "logo.png", 1600 × 160
   pixels; "logo2.png", another picture; "thumb.png"; and "home.png", 300
   × 100 pixels.

   - **"Logo" uploaded**: open Settings › Website › "Appearance" ›
     "Setup", press "Upload File" under "Logo" and choose "logo.png": a
     small preview shows with "Remove", no "Restore Original", and an
     "Alternate text" box beside it under the guidance "Describe this
     image for visitors viewing the site in a text-only browser or with
     assistive devices. Example: "Our editor speaking at the PKP
     conference."" (Fields, the upload boxes).
   - **"Logo" saved**: type "Journal logo" in "Alternate text" and press
     "Save": "Saved". The visitor reloads the home page: the logo stands
     in the header in place of the journal's name, 800 × 80 pixels, with
     "Journal logo" as its description, and pressing it opens the home
     page; the "About the Journal" page, from the header's "About" menu,
     carries it too (Rule 20). The visitor notes the logo picture's own
     address.
   - **Replaced, then restored**: reload the page and open "Setup": the
     "Logo" box shows its preview and "Journal logo", with no "Upload
     File". Press "Remove": "Restore Original" and "Upload File" show.
     Press "Upload File" and choose "logo2.png": it arrives with an empty
     "Alternate text", and "Restore Original" still shows; press "Restore
     Original": "logo.png" is back, with "Journal logo" in "Alternate
     text" (Fields, the upload boxes).
   - **Replaced from the keyboard**: reload the page and open "Setup".
     Press Tab until the focus reaches the "Logo" box's "Upload File",
     which a screen reader announces though the screen does not show it,
     and press Enter: the file chooser opens. Choose "logo2.png": it
     takes the place of "logo.png" with an empty "Alternate text", and
     "Restore Original" shows; press "Restore Original": "logo.png" is
     back, with "Journal logo" (Fields, the upload boxes).
   - **The thumbnail**: press "Upload File" under "Journal thumbnail"
     ("Press thumbnail", "Server thumbnail"), choose "thumb.png", type
     "Thumb" in its "Alternate text" and press "Save". The visitor opens
     the site's home page, the install's own address: beside the journal
     in the list of journals stands "thumb.png", with "Thumb" as its
     description (Rule 21).
   - **"Homepage Image"**: upload "home.png" under "Homepage Image", type
     "Our building" in its "Alternate text" and press "Save". The visitor
     reloads the journal's home page: on a journal the picture is
     stretched to the full width of the page's main column, with "Our
     building" as its description; on a press and a preprint server it
     shows at 300 × 100 pixels [A1](#a1) (Rule 18).
   - **"Header Background Image"**: open "Theme", tick "Show the homepage
     image as the header background." and press "Save". The visitor
     reloads the home page, then opens "About the Journal": on both the
     picture fills the header's background, and the home page no longer
     shows it in its body (Rule 8). Untick the box and press "Save": the
     visitor's reloaded home page shows the picture in its body again,
     and the header's background no longer holds it (Rule 18).
   - **"Page Footer"**: open the side tab "Setup", type "Footer line" in
     "Page Footer"
     and press "Save". The visitor reloads the home page, then "About the
     Journal": "Footer line" stands at the foot of both, above the
     application's logo (Rule 22).
   - **"Logo" removed**: press "Remove" under "Logo": "Restore Original"
     shows; press "Save". The visitor reloads the home page: the header
     shows the journal's name again (Rule 20); the logo's address noted
     before no longer opens the picture (Side effects).
   - **Control**: before the first "Save", the uploaded "logo.png" had
     not reached the visitor's header: an upload counts only once the tab
     is saved (Fields, the upload boxes).

4. **The sidebar: blocks placed, ordered, switched off and removed**

   Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal with English as its one
   language, and a visitor, signed out, on its home page in a second
   browser.

   - **The list as it opens**: open Settings › Website › "Appearance" ›
     "Setup": "Sidebar" holds one box per block, none ticked: "Web Feed
     Plugin", "Information Block", "Subscription Block" and "Language
     Toggle Block" on a journal; the same with "Browse Block" in place of
     "Subscription Block" on a press; "Web Feed Plugin" and "Language
     Toggle Block" alone on a preprint server. There is no ""Make a
     Submission" Block" (Rule 23).
   - **A block plugin enabled**: open Settings › Website › "Plugins" ›
     "Installed Plugins" and tick ""Developed By" Block". Reload the page
     and open "Appearance" › "Setup": "Sidebar" now holds a box
     ""Developed By" Block", unticked (Rule 23).
   - **Placed**: tick "Web Feed Plugin", ""Developed By" Block" and
     "Language Toggle Block" and press "Save". Reload the page: the three
     ticked boxes stand first in "Sidebar", the unticked ones after them
     (Rule 23). The visitor reloads the home page: beside the content, a
     sidebar holds the "Web Feed Plugin" block and the ""Developed By"
     Block" in the list's order, and nothing for "Language Toggle Block",
     the journal having one language (Rule 24).
   - **Dragged**: drag ""Developed By" Block" by its handle to the top of
     the list and press "Save": the visitor's reloaded sidebar shows the
     ""Developed By" Block" first (Rules 23, 24).
   - **Moved by its arrow**: press the up arrow of "Web Feed Plugin",
     whose text reads "Increase position of Web Feed Plugin", until the
     row stands first, and press "Save": the visitor's reloaded sidebar
     shows the "Web Feed Plugin" block first [A3](#a3) (Rules 23, 24).
   - **Its plugin switched off**: on "Plugins" › "Installed Plugins",
     untick "Web Feed Plugin" and confirm. The visitor reloads: its block
     has left the sidebar. Reload Settings › Website and open "Appearance"
     › "Setup": "Sidebar" no longer lists it; leave the tab unsaved (a
     save there is refused now [A4](#a4)) (Rule 25).
   - **Its plugin switched on again**: tick "Web Feed Plugin" on
     "Plugins" › "Installed Plugins". Reload and open "Appearance" ›
     "Setup": "Sidebar" lists "Web Feed Plugin" ticked and first again; the visitor's
     reloaded sidebar shows its block first again (Rule 25).
   - **None ticked**: untick every box in "Sidebar" and press "Save". The
     visitor reloads the home page, then opens "About the Journal": no
     page has a sidebar, and the content keeps its width and stands in
     the middle of the page (Rule 24).
   - **Control**: before the first "Save", the visitor's home page had no
     sidebar (Rules 23, 24).

5. **The order of the masthead's roles**

   Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal whose "Editorial
   Masthead" tab has never been saved and whose "Journal editor",
   "Section editor" and "Editorial Board Member" roles ("Press editor",
   "Series editor" and "Editorial Board Member" on a press; "Moderator"
   and "Editorial Board Member" on a preprint server) each have a
   current member and a former one, and a visitor, signed out, in a
   second browser.

   - **The list as it opens**: open Settings › Website › "Appearance" ›
     "Editorial Masthead": under "Define the order of masthead roles for
     public display." the list reads "Journal editor", "Section editor",
     "Editorial Board Member" ("Press editor", "Series editor", "Editorial
     Board Member"; "Moderator", "Editorial Board Member"), each row with
     a drag handle and up and down arrows and no box to tick, and no
     Reviewer role; below it, "Reviewers" with the note "Reviewers will
     be displayed in a standardized format to maintain uniformity and
     ensure easy discoverability in this section." (Fields, "Editorial
     Masthead"; Rule 28).
   - **A role ticked before the first save** {OJS OMP}: open Settings ›
     Users & Roles › "Roles", press "Edit" on the "Production editor"
     row, tick "Consider role in masthead list" and save the window.
     Reload Settings › Website and open "Editorial Masthead": "Production
     editor" is in the list, above "Section editor" ("Series editor"), at
     the place of its permission level (Rule 28; Settings bullet 24).
   - **Reordered**: press the up arrow of "Editorial Board Member" until
     the row stands first, and press "Save": "Saved". The visitor opens
     "Editorial Masthead" from the header's "About" menu: "Editorial Board
     Member" is the first role heading, the others following in the
     list's order; the visitor presses "Editorial History" in the line
     "View Editorial History": that page's first role heading is
     "Editorial Board Member" too (Rule 28).
   - **A role ticked after the first save** {OJS OMP}: on Settings ›
     Users & Roles › "Roles", tick "Consider role in masthead list" for
     "Layout Editor" the same way. Reload Settings › Website and open
     "Editorial Masthead": "Layout Editor" stands last in the list
     (Rule 28; Settings bullet 24).
   - **Control**: before the "Save", the visitor's "Editorial Masthead"
     page listed "Editorial Board Member" as its last role heading
     (Rule 28).

6. **The "Lists" tab: refused numbers, then one entry a page**

   Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal holding three articles
   published outside any issue (a scratch press with nothing published;
   a scratch preprint server with eleven preprints posted today), and a
   visitor, signed out, in a second browser.

   - **As it opens**: open Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Lists":
     "Items per page" reads 25 and "Page links" 10 (Fields, "Lists").
   - **"Latest preprints"** {OPS}: the visitor opens the home page: under
     "Latest preprints" stand ten of the eleven preprints, with no page
     links (Rule 16).
   - **Refused**: empty "Items per page" and press "Save": "This field is
     required." and nothing is sent. Type "0" and press "Save": "This
     must be at least 1."; the same for "-1". Type "abc" and press
     "Save": "This is not a valid integer."; the same for "2.5". Type "25"
     back in "Items per page", type "0" in "Page links" and press "Save": "This must be at
     least 1." (Fields, "Lists").
   - **No upper limit**: type "100000" in both boxes and press "Save":
     "Saved" (Fields, "Lists").
   - **One a page**: type "1" in "Items per page" and "3" in "Page links"
     and press "Save": "Saved"; reloaded, the tab reads 1 and 3 (Rule 2).
   - **"Latest Publications"** {OJS}: the visitor reloads the home page:
     under "Latest Publications" one article, "1 - 1 of 3 items", the
     page numbers, ">" and ">>", and no "<<" or "<". The visitor presses
     "2": "2 - 2 of 3 items", then "<<", "<", "1 2 3" with 2 in the
     middle, ">" and ">>". The visitor presses "3": "3 - 3 of 3 items",
     with no ">" or ">>" (Rules 13, 29, 30).
   - **"Latest preprints" unchanged** {OPS}: the visitor reloads the home
     page: "Latest preprints" still lists ten preprints, with no page
     links: "Items per page" does not apply there (Rule 16).
   - **Control**: Settings › Users & Roles › "Users" still lists every
     user of the journal on one page (Rule 29).

7. **Date formats, from the tab to the public pages**

   Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal with announcements on,
   "Display on Homepage" at 1 and one announcement, "Call for papers",
   posted today, a published book {OMP}, and a visitor, signed out, in
   a second browser. The dates below are written for 24 September 2026
   at 3:05 in the afternoon; the tab and the pages show the tester's
   own day and time in the same patterns.

   - **The tab as it opens**: open Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Date &
     Time": under "Date and Time Formats", five groups, each choice but
     "Custom" written as today's date or time in its pattern. Chosen:
     "September 24, 2026" under "Date", "2026-09-24" under "Date
     (Short)", "03:05 PM" under "Time", "September 24, 2026 - 03:05 PM"
     under "Date & Time" and "2026-09-24 03:05 PM" under "Date & Time
     (Short)" (Fields, "Date & Time").
   - **The combined choices follow**: under "Date (Short)" choose
     "24.09.2026": the ready choice of "Date & Time (Short)" now reads
     "24.09.2026 03:05 PM" and is still the chosen one. Choose
     "2026-09-24" again: it reads "2026-09-24 03:05 PM" again. Choose
     "24.09.2026" once more, then under "Date" choose "24 September
     2026": the ready choice of "Date & Time" now reads "24 September
     2026 - 03:05 PM" (Rule 32). Press "Save": "Saved".
   - **The visitor's dates**: the visitor reloads the home page: the
     announcement's posted date reads "24.09.2026" (Rule 31). {OMP} The
     book's page gives its "Published" date as "24 September 2026", and
     the catalog lists the book with the same date (Rule 31).
   - **"Custom"**: under "Date (Short)" choose "Custom", type "d/m/Y" in
     its box and press "Save". The visitor reloads the home page: the
     announcement's date reads "24/09/2026" (Rule 33).
   - **Control**: before the first "Save", the visitor's home page gave
     the announcement's date as "2026-09-24" (Fields, "Date & Time";
     Rule 31).

8. **A journal in two languages**

   Given: Journal Manager, working in English, on a scratch journal
   whose primary language is English, with French ticked under "UI" and
   "Forms", announcements on, "Display on Homepage" at 1 and one
   announcement posted today, a visitor, signed out, in a second
   browser, and "logo.png", a PNG picture.

   - **A French footer alone**: open Settings › Website › "Appearance" ›
     "Setup", press "French" at the top of the tab, type "Pied de page"
     in the French "Page Footer" box, leave the English one empty and
     press "Save". The visitor opens {journal address}/en, the home page
     in English: its foot reads "Pied de page"; {journal address}/fr_CA,
     the home page in French, reads the same (Rule 3).
   - **Both languages**: type "English footer" in the English "Page
     Footer" box and press "Save": the visitor's reloaded English page
     reads "English footer", the French one still "Pied de page"
     (Rule 3).
   - **An English logo alone**: press "Upload File" under the English
     "Logo", choose "logo.png", type "Journal logo" in "Alternate text",
     leave the French "Logo" empty and press "Save". The visitor reloads
     the French page: its header shows the logo, with "Journal logo" as
     its description (Rule 3).
   - **Dates per language**: open "Setup" › "Date & Time", press
     "French", choose "24.09.2026" under the French "Date (Short)" and
     press "Save". The visitor reloads both pages: the announcement's
     posted date reads "24.09.2026" on the French one and "2026-09-24" on
     the English one (Rule 3).
   - **Control**: before the first "Save", the foot of the English page
     held no footer text (Fields, "Setup": "Page Footer" empty on a new
     journal).

9. **A journal with no issue: its recent articles and its categories** {OJS}

   Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal with no issue, two
   articles published outside any issue and the categories "Arts" and
   "Science", "Science" holding the subcategory "Physics", and a
   visitor, signed out, in a second browser.

   - **As it opens**: open Settings › Website › "Appearance" › "Theme":
     under "Journal Content Organization" only "Include recent most
     published articles" is ticked (Rule 10).
   - **The home page**: the visitor opens it: "Latest Publications"
     lists the two articles with "1 - 2 of 2 items" and no page links;
     there is no row of categories and no "Current Issue" (Rules 12, 13,
     15).
   - **The categories**: tick "Include a listing of categories" and press
     "Save". The visitor reloads the home page: above "Latest
     Publications" stands a row of links, "Arts" and "Science", without
     "Physics"; "Arts" opens that category's page (Rules 12, 15).
   - **Recent articles off**: untick "Include recent most published
     articles" and press "Save": the visitor's reloaded home page keeps
     the row of categories and no longer shows "Latest Publications"
     (Rule 10).
   - **Control**: reloaded, the "Theme" tab has "Include a listing of
     categories" ticked alone (Rule 2).

10. **A journal with a current issue, then not published online** {OJS}

    Given: Journal Manager, on a scratch journal with one published
    issue, "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)", holding no article, and a visitor,
    signed out, in a second browser.

    - **As it opens**: open Settings › Website › "Appearance" › "Theme":
      under "Journal Content Organization" only "Include the current
      issue's table of contents" is ticked (Rule 10).
    - **The home page**: the visitor opens it: the heading "Current
      Issue", the issue's name "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)", no article under
      it, then the link "View All Issues", which opens the archive
      (Rule 14).
    - **Not published online**: open Settings › Distribution › "Access",
      choose "OJS will not be used to publish the journal's contents
      online." under "Publishing Mode" and save the tab. The visitor
      reloads the home page: "Current Issue" is gone (Rule 14; Settings
      bullet 25).
    - **Control**: the home page never showed "Latest Publications": the
      journal has no article outside a published issue (Rule 13).

## Coverage

Left out of the scenarios above, by reason:

- **Budget** — variants:
  - a role newly considered for the masthead on a preprint server, before and after the tab's first save {OPS} (Rule 28; Settings bullet 24)
- **Nothing new to test**:
  - the Editor and the Production Editor on the same tabs: the same fields and saves as the Journal Manager in scenarios 1 to 10 (Actors row 1)
- **Register carries it**:
  - A1 (a press's and a preprint server's homepage image without its description; Rule 18; scenario 3 marks it)
  - A2 (a logo saved without alternate text, the header's home link left without a name; Rule 20)
  - A3 (the ordering arrows' names for a screen reader; Rules 23, 28; scenario 4 marks it)
  - A4 ("Setup" refusing a save while a placed block's plugin is disabled; Rule 25; scenario 4 marks it)
  - A5 (the removed style sheet's file still opening at its address; Rule 26; scenario 1 marks it)
  - A6 (the French interface's raw codes on the "Theme" tab; Rule 35)
  - A7 (a file refused through "Upload File" locking the box and the tab's "Save"; Fields, the upload boxes)
  - A8 (the "3:05PM" time choice printed in lower case; Fields, "Date & Time")
  - A9 (an empty "Custom" under "Date (Short)" leaving the editorial dates without the date; Rule 33)
  - OJS2 (a first issue created on a journal that never saved "Theme", the home page switching by itself {OJS}; Rule 10)
  - OJS3 (a published issue's articles absent from "Latest Publications", the list ordered by submission {OJS}; Rule 13)
  - OJS4 (the Settings Wizard showing another organization for a journal with no issue {OJS}; Rule 34; scenario 2 marks it)
  - OJS5 (every "Journal Content Organization" box unticked and saved {OJS}; Rule 10)
  - OJS6 (the recent articles' titles as headings at the section's own level {OJS}; Rule 13)
  - OJS7 (a journal's homepage image saved without "Alternate text" {OJS}; Rule 18)
  - OMP2 (a press's category page longer than "Items per page" {OMP}; Rule 29)
- **No seed**:
  - another theme: a test install has "Default Theme" alone (Rule 4; Settings bullet 1)
  - the installation's default formats changed: only its configuration file sets them (Settings bullet 27)
- **Owned by another feature**:
  - the Section Editor, the Assistant, the Author, the Reviewer and the Reader kept out of the Settings pages (Actors preamble; [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md) scenario 2)
  - a Site Administrator with no role in the journal on Settings › Website: the access-denied page on a press and a preprint server, the "Error" window on a journal (Actors preamble; [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md#a1), [Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md#a9))
  - a signed-out visitor on a journal that requires visitors to sign in, or that is not enabled, getting the Login page (Actors row 3; [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md), Rule 22)
  - a change left unsaved, gone without a question once the page is left (Rule 2; [Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md), Rule 5)
  - "Usage statistics display options" on a chart: the "Downloads" section of an article's, a book's and a preprint's page (Rule 9; Settings bullet 7; *Article landing page & reading*, *Monograph landing page*)
  - the catalog fields of a press: "Show Series", "Featured Books", "New Releases", "Order of monographs" and the cover sizes {OMP} (Rule 17; Settings bullets 8, 14, 19; *Catalog browse*, *Catalog management*)
  - "Items per page" on the listing pages (Rule 29; [Navigation menus & site chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md) scenario 10)
  - "Items per page" and "Page links" on the older editorial lists, and the "Users" list's own page length (Rules 29, 30; *Roles configuration*, *Users management*)
  - "Date & Time (Short)" on a submission file's notes and a library file's "Date uploaded" (Rule 31; [Submission files](U36-submission-files.md), [Submission & Publisher Libraries](U39-submission-and-publisher-libraries.md))

### All apps

<a id="a1"></a>
**A1 — A press's and a preprint server's homepage image has no description** · 🐞 · minor.
A manager who types an "Alternate text" for the "Homepage Image" expects
it as the picture's description, as a journal's home page gives it. A
press's and a preprint server's home pages show the picture with an empty
description, whatever was typed, so a screen reader skips it. Since:
2019-05 (the journal's page was corrected then, the others never) ·
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a1</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — A logo without alternate text leaves the home link unnamed** · ❓ · minor.
With "Alternate text" left empty, the header logo has no description at
all, and the link it forms to the home page has no name a screen reader
can read; the same header without a logo reads the journal's name.
Question: should a logo without alternate text be described by the
journal's name? Lean: yes; the name is what the logo stands for, and the
field is easy to leave empty. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a2</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — The ordering arrows are misnamed to screen readers** · 🐞 · minor.
On "Editorial Masthead" a screen reader announces each role's up arrow as
"{role} Decrease position of {role}", although the arrow's own text reads
"Increase position of {role}", and the down arrow as "Decrease position
of {role}". Under "Sidebar" each block's box is announced with both
"Increase position of {block}" and "Decrease position of {block}" in its
name, so the box's own meaning is buried. A manager relying on a screen
reader cannot tell which arrow moves a role up. Basis: probe.
<sup>f-a3</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — "Setup" refuses to save over a placed block whose plugin is off** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A manager who disables a block's plugin while the block is placed, then
saves any change on "Setup" (a new "Page Footer", say), is refused under
"Sidebar" with "The {name} block can not be found. Please make sure the
plugin is installed and enabled.", although "Sidebar" no longer shows the
block. The save goes through only once the "Sidebar" list is changed,
which drops the block's place without a word. The same holds for a custom
block ([Custom pages & blocks](U09-custom-pages-and-blocks.md#a15)).
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a4</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — A removed style sheet's file stays public** · 🐞 · latent.
A manager who presses "Remove" under "Journal style sheet" and saves
expects the file to be gone. The public pages stop loading it, but the
file stays in the journal's public files and still opens at its old
address, while a removed logo or picture is deleted. Nothing on screen
shows it; it matters when the file held something meant to be withdrawn.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a5</sup>

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — Raw codes on the French "Theme" tab** · 🐞 · minor.
A manager working in French reads, in place of labels,
"##manager.setup.journalContentOrganization##", its description and its
three boxes on a journal; on a press the only entry of the "Thème" list
("##plugins.themes.default.name##") and every label, description and
choice of the default theme's fields ("##manager.setup.contextSummary##",
typography, header image, colour, series listing, statistics); and
"##plugins.themes.default.option.displayStats.label##" with its three
choices on a preprint server. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a6</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — A refused file locks the upload box and the tab's "Save"** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A manager who picks a ".pdf" for "Logo" with "Upload File" sees "You
can't upload files of this type." in the box and expects to pick another
file. The box keeps an empty frame with no "Remove", its "Upload File" is
disabled, and so is the tab's "Save", with "Please correct one error. Go
to Logo: You can't upload files of this type. Jump to next error" at the
form's foot. Only a picture dragged onto the box turns both back on; a
manager who uses the button alone has to leave the page, losing every
other change on the tab. "Favicon" and the style sheet behave the same.

<a id="a8"></a>
**A8 — The "3:05PM" time choice prints in lower case** · 🐞 · minor.
The third "Time" choice on "Date & Time" reads "3:05PM". A manager who
picks it and saves expects times written that way; they print in lower
case instead: a library file uploaded at 7:17 in the evening reads
"2026-09-24 7:17pm" under "Date uploaded". Basis: probe. <sup>f-a8</sup>

<a id="a9"></a>
**A9 — An empty "Custom" under "Date (Short)" strips the date from editorial dates** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A manager who picks "Custom" under "Date (Short)", leaves its box empty
and presses "Save" sees "Saved", and the public dates fall back to
"2026-09-24" as Rule 33 says. But "Date & Time (Short)" is saved as the
time alone: on the next load that group sits on "Custom" with "h:i A" in
its box, and the editorial dates print with no date (a file's note reads
"07:17 PM", a library file's "Date uploaded" "07:17 PM"). Choosing
another "Date (Short)" does not bring the date back; the manager has to
pick the group's ready choice and save again. Basis: probe.

### OJS

<a id="ojs1"></a>
**OJS1 — Only a journal has "Journal Content Organization"** · ✅ · minor.
A journal chooses which of the current issue, its recent articles and its
categories its home page shows; a press's home page follows its catalog
fields ([OMP1](#omp1)) and a preprint server's is fixed ([OPS1](#ops1)).
The three home pages serve different publishing models. Basis: code.
<sup>f-ojs1</sup>

<a id="ojs2"></a>
**OJS2 — The home page changes by itself when the first issue is created** · ❓ · user-visible.
A journal that never saved "Theme" shows its published articles under
"Latest Publications". As soon as its first issue is created, even one
not yet published, the home page shows the current issue instead, which
stays absent until an issue is published: the articles vanish from the
home page with nobody having changed a setting. Question: should a
journal keep the organization it shows until a manager changes it? Lean:
yes; store the organization when the journal is created, or count only
published issues. Basis: probe. <sup>f-ojs2</sup>

<a id="ojs3"></a>
**OJS3 — "Include recent most published articles" lists only articles outside a published issue** · ❓ · minor.
The box promises the journal's most recent articles. The list holds only
articles published with no issue or in an issue not yet published, the
most recently submitted first, so a journal that publishes by issue sees
it empty, and an article published early but submitted long ago sits at
the bottom. Question: is the list meant for articles published ahead of
an issue alone? Lean: yes, for continuous publishing; the box's wording
should say so, and the list should run by publication date.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-ojs3</sup>

<a id="ojs4"></a>
**OJS4 — The Settings Wizard shows another content organization** · ❓ · minor.
For a journal with no issue, the journal's own "Theme" tab shows "Include
recent most published articles" ticked, which is what its home page
shows. The Site Administrator's Settings Wizard shows "Include the current
issue's table of contents" ticked instead, and a save of the wizard's
"Appearance" tab, made to change the colour say, stores that choice and
empties the home page of its articles. Question: should the wizard show
the journal's own organization? Lean: yes; the two screens edit the same
settings. Basis: probe. <sup>f-ojs4</sup>

<a id="ojs5"></a>
**OJS5 — The home page cannot be set to show none of the three parts** · 🐞 · minor.
A manager who unticks all three "Journal Content Organization" boxes and
presses "Save" sees "Saved" and expects a home page without the current
issue, the recent articles and the categories. The tab reopens with the
journal's default ticked ("Include the current issue's table of
contents" on a journal with an issue), and the home page shows "Current
Issue". Basis: probe. <sup>f-ojs5</sup>

<a id="ojs6"></a>
**OJS6 — The recent articles are headings beside their section** · 🐞 · minor.
Under "Latest Publications" each article's title is a heading of the
same level as "Latest Publications" itself, so a screen reader's list of
headings shows the articles beside the section instead of inside it; the
current issue's articles sit one level below their heading, as expected.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-ojs6</sup>

<a id="ojs7"></a>
**OJS7 — A journal's homepage image without alternate text has no text alternative** · ❓ · minor.
With "Alternate text" left empty, a journal's homepage image carries no
text alternative at all, so a screen reader may announce it by its file
name; a press's and a server's always carry an empty one
([A1](#a1)). Question: should an empty box mark the picture as
decorative, so a screen reader skips it? Lean: yes; a file name tells a
listener nothing. Basis: probe. <sup>f-ojs7</sup>

### OMP

<a id="omp1"></a>
**OMP1 — A press's appearance tabs carry the catalog's fields** · ✅ · minor.
A press's "Setup" adds "Featured Books", "New Releases" and "Order of
monographs", its "Advanced" adds the cover image sizes, and its "Theme"
adds "Show Series": the catalog is a press's home for its books, and a
journal and a preprint server have none. Basis: code. <sup>f-omp1</sup>

<a id="omp2"></a>
**OMP2 — A press's category page has no way past its first page** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A category holding more books than "Items per page" heads its page with
the full count ("3 Titles" at "Items per page" 1) but shows only the
first page's books, with no page numbers and no "Previous" or "Next", so
a visitor cannot reach the rest. The catalog pages the same books with
"Next", and a journal's and a preprint server's category pages carry page
numbers. Basis: probe. <sup>f-omp2</sup>

### OPS

<a id="ops1"></a>
**OPS1 — A preprint server's home page has a fixed order** · ✅ · minor.
A preprint server's home page always lists its latest preprints under a
search box and its category links, with the summary after them; only the
summary can be switched off. Continuous posting has no issue to show.
Basis: code. <sup>f-ops1</sup>

<a id="footnotes"></a>
## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a — the screens and who reaches them.** `PKP\pages\management\ManagementHandler::website()`
builds the Website page's forms and `lib/pkp/templates/management/website.tpl`
mounts them; the page's guard is `CanAccessSettingsPolicy` in
`ManagementHandler::authorize()` (the manager-level group with
`permitSettings`, or the Site Administrator), described in the Journal
identity spec's note on who opens the Settings pages. Each app's
`APP\pages\management\SettingsHandler` extends `ManagementHandler` and
overrides `workflow` and `distribution` only, so `website()` is the shared
one. The three checkouts pin one pkp-lib (`76a315591b`) and one
ui-library (`03d1cee2`) at ojs `d9b567efec`, omp `187f0f40d`, ops
`61cd158ce3`. The site's own appearance is `AdminHandler::settings()`
with the `siteTheme` and `siteAppearanceSetup` components, shown only on
a site with more than one context (seed-facts, 2026-09-16). Public pages
read the settings through `PKPTemplateManager::initialize()` and
`lib/pkp/templates/frontend/components/{header,footer}.tpl`, which no app
overrides. Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b — the Settings Wizard.** `AdminHandler::wizard()` (site
administrator only) renders `lib/pkp/templates/admin/contextSettings.tpl`:
top tab `setup` labelled `manager.setup` ("Journal Settings", OMP "Setup",
OPS "Server Settings"), side tab `appearance` (`manager.website.appearance`)
mounting `<theme-form>` with a `PKPThemeForm` built for the edited context,
whose action is `api/v1/contexts/{id}/theme` under the edited context's
path. The row action is `ContextGridRow`'s `wizard` link
(`grid.action.wizard` "Settings wizard"). `PKPContextController::editTheme()`
admits `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_ID_MANAGER`. Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c — the tabs and their saves.** `website.tpl`: top tab `appearance`
with side tabs `theme` (`<theme-form>`), `appearance-setup`,
`appearance-masthead`, `advanced`; top tab `setup` with `lists`
(`PKPListsForm`) and `dateTime` (`<date-time-form>`) among the others. Every
form but the theme form sends `PUT api/v1/contexts/{id}` with its own
fields (`Form.vue::submit()`, sent as POST with `X-Http-Method-Override:
PUT`), and `PKPContextService::edit()` merges only
the props received and fires the `Context::edit` hook; no mailable,
notification or log entry is raised on this path. The theme form sends
`PUT api/v1/contexts/{id}/theme`, which saves each option through
`ThemePlugin::saveOption()` and clears the template and compiled-CSS
caches (`clearTemplateCache()`, `clearCssCache()`). Unsaved changes: the
Journal identity spec's note on saving a tab (live-probed there
2026-09-23: kept across tabs, dropped on leaving, no dialog).
Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 2; Side effects bullet 1; all three apps,
two runs): a "Theme" change, a "Page Footer" and an "Items per page"
left unsaved each stayed in their boxes across the other side tabs and
the top tab "Setup"; "Save" on "Date & Time" stored nothing of "Lists";
a reload or the Dashboard dropped the unsaved changes with no question.
Pressing the side menu's "Website" while Settings › Website is open
loads nothing, so an unsaved change stays in its box. Mail catcher
counts for every user of the scratch journal were 0 before and after
seven to eleven saves, and the manager's Tasks panel held the same one
task before and after.

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d — the upload boxes.** `PKP\components\forms\FieldUpload` and
`FieldUploadImage`, ui-library `FieldUpload.vue` / `FieldUploadImage.vue`:
`common.upload.addFile` "Upload File", `form.dropzone.dictDefaultMessage`
"Drop files here to upload", `common.remove` "Remove",
`common.upload.restore` "Restore Original", `common.altText` "Alternate
text", `common.altTextInstructions`. The refusal reads "You can't upload
files of this type." on all three apps (live-probed 2026-09-24). An
image box accepts `image/*` unless the field narrows it; the favicon box
carries "Alternate text" too. On save, `PKPContextService::edit()`
moves each temporary file into the journal's public files
(`_saveFileParam()`: `public/journals|presses|contexts/<id>/`, stored as
`name`, `uploadName`, `width`, `height`, `dateUploaded`, `altText`); a
`null` value deletes the stored file (`PublicFileManager::removeContextFile()`).
The thumbnails are saved the same way by each app's `ContextService`.
Since 2026-09-24 the test installs' public files load (seed-facts: the
relative `public_files_dir`). Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Side effects
bullet 2; all three apps): a saved logo's address answered a signed-out
browser and answered "not found" after "Remove" and "Save".

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e — the theme's fields.** `DefaultThemePlugin::init()` in each app's
`plugins/themes/default/`: `addOption()` for `typography` (radio, default
`notoSans`), `baseColour` (`FieldColor`, `#1E6292`),
`showDescriptionInJournalIndex` / `…PressIndex` / `…ServerIndex`
(label `manager.setup.contextSummary`), OJS `journalContentOrganization`
(`APP\journal\enums\JournalContentOption`, pkp-lib#9295, 2025-05/06),
`useHomepageImageAsHeader`, `displayStats` (default `none`), and OMP
`showCatalogSeriesListing`. Order: OJS typography, colour, summary,
organization, header image, statistics; OMP typography, summary, header
image, colour, series, statistics; OPS as OJS without the organization.
`PKPThemeForm` sets each field's value from `getOptionValues()` (null
when never saved) and `Field::getConfig()` shows `value ?? default`.
Labels: each app's `plugins/themes/default/locale/en/locale.po` and the
app's `manager.setup.contextSummary` ("Journal Summary", "Press Summary",
"Server Summary"). Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f — "Setup".** `PKPAppearanceSetupForm`: `pageHeaderLogoImage`
(`manager.setup.logo`), `homepageImage` (tooltip
`manager.setup.homepageImage.description`), `pageFooter`
(`FieldRichTextarea`, toolbar `bold italic superscript subscript | link |
blockquote bullist numlist | image | code`, upload URL
`api/v1/_uploadPublicFile`), `sidebar` (`FieldOptions`, `isOrderable`).
Each app's `AppearanceSetupForm` inserts its thumbnail (`journalThumbnail`,
`pressThumbnail`, `serverThumbnail`) after the logo; OMP's appends
`displayFeaturedBooks`, `displayNewReleases` (booleans, no default in the
schema) and `catalogSortOption` (radio of
`Repo::submission()->getSortSelectOptions()`, nullable, no default). A
field's `tooltip` renders as the icon beside its label. Code read
2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h — "Advanced".** `PKPAppearanceAdvancedForm`: `styleSheet`
(`FieldUpload`, `acceptedFiles` `.css`, `fileUrl` the public address),
`favicon` (`FieldUploadImage`, `acceptedFiles`
`image/x-icon,image/png,image/gif`), `additionalHomeContent` (same
toolbar as the footer). OMP's `AppearanceAdvancedForm` adds
`coverThumbnailsMaxWidth` / `…MaxHeight` (schema integers, defaults 106
and 100, `min:1`), used when cover thumbnails are generated
(`APP\publication\Repository`, `SeriesForm`, the category API). OJS and
OPS subclasses are empty. Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i — "Lists".** `PKPListsForm`: `itemsPerPage`, `numPageLinks`
(`FieldText`, `isRequired`, size small). Schema: integers, defaults 25
and 10, `nullable`, `min:1`. `PKPBaseController::convertStringsToSchema()`
turns a digits-only string into an integer and leaves anything else a
string, so "abc" and "2.5" fail the `integer` rule (`validator.integer`
"This is not a valid integer."), while "0" and "-1" fail `min`
(`validator.min.numeric` "This must be at least {$min}.", live-probed
2026-09-24 for "-1"); the schema sets no maximum; an emptied
required box is refused in the browser (`validator.required`). Seen
2026-09-23 on all three apps: "Items per page" 25 and "Page links" 10 on
every context (seed-facts).

<a id="fn-j"></a>
**j — "Date & Time".** `PKPDateTimeForm`: group `descriptions`
(`manager.setup.dateTime.descriptionTitle`, `…description` with its link
"format characters" to the PHP manual's date-format characters);
`dateFormatLong` presets `F j, Y`, `F j Y`, `j F Y`, `Y F j`;
`dateFormatShort` `Y-m-d`, `d-m-Y`, `m/d/Y`, `d.m.Y`; `timeFormat` `H:i`,
`h:i A`, `g:ia`; each plus a `Custom` input
(`manager.setup.dateTime.custom`). `datetimeFormatLong` and
`datetimeFormatShort` offer one preset per locale built on the server
from the saved date and time (`{long} - {time}`, `{short} {time}`) plus
`Custom`. `Context::getDateTimeFormats()` fills a locale with no saved
value from the configuration file's `[general]` `date_format_long` "F j,
Y", `date_format_short` "Y-m-d", `time_format` "h:i A",
`datetime_format_long` "F j, Y - h:i A", `datetime_format_short` "Y-m-d
h:i A" (each app's `config.TEMPLATE.inc.php`); a new context stores the
five formats empty. ui-library `DateTimeForm.vue::mounted()` rewrites
every preset's label with luxon's `DateTime.now()`, the browser's clock
(pkp-lib#11079, 2025-03), so `g:ia` shows as "3:05PM" while PHP's `date()`
prints "3:05pm" (A8); the French labels read "15:05", "03:05 p.m.",
"3:05p.m.". `fieldChanged()` / `updateFields()` rewrite the combined
preset's label and move the combined value when it equalled the old
combination. An empty custom box saves `null` for that group and the
getters fall back to the configuration file. Saved under "Date (Short)",
the stored `datetimeFormatShort` is the time pattern alone (A9; why the
combination drops the date was not traced).

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k — the theme list.** `PKPThemeForm` fills the `themePluginPath`
select from `PluginRegistry::loadCategory('themes', true)` (enabled theme
plugins) and keeps each theme's option fields in `themeFields`;
ui-library `ThemeForm.vue::changeTheme()` swaps the fields under "Theme"
for the chosen theme's on a new choice, and "Save" switches the journal
to it. That swap is known from the code alone: no test install has a second
theme, and the Plugin Gallery that would install one answers a server
error there (checked 2026-09-24). `PKPContextService::validate()`
refuses a theme that is not installed and enabled
(`manager.setup.theme.notFound`). The three checkouts ship
`plugins/themes/default` alone; live-probed 2026-09-16 and 2026-09-24 on
all three apps: the select offers "Default Theme" alone, under a plain
sentence (not a link), and Plugins › "Installed Plugins" lists it as the
only theme plugin. `PKPTemplateManager` picks the active theme from the
context's `themePluginPath` for frontend pages; `DefaultThemePlugin::init()`
registers the menu areas `primary` and `user`.

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l — typography and colour.** `DefaultThemePlugin::init()` adds the font
stylesheet for the chosen `typography` and LESS variables `@font` /
`@font-heading`; a `baseColour` other than `#1E6292` sets `@bg-base`, and
when `isColourDark()` is false (contrast 130 or more) also
`@text-bg-base: rgba(0,0,0,0.84)`. `saveOption()` stores `null` for a
value not matching `/^#[0-9a-fA-F]{1,6}$/` (pkp/pkp-lib#11974), and
`init()` falls back to `#1E6292` for such a value; on screen that
fallback is not reached, because the colour box sends the colour chosen
before when the typed code is not one it can read (live-probed
2026-09-24, "red" and "#12345"). The compiled
stylesheet is served by `PKP\controllers\page\PageHandler::css()`
(`$$$call$$$/page/page/css?name=stylesheet`), cached per context as
`cache/{contextId}-stylesheet-{hash}.css` and cleared on every theme save.

<a id="fn-m"></a>
**m — the home page.** OJS `APP\pages\index\IndexHandler::index()` with
`templates/frontend/pages/indexJournal.tpl`; OMP `IndexHandler::_displayPressIndexPage()`
with `index.tpl`; OPS `IndexHandler::index()` with `indexServer.tpl`; each
extends `PKPIndexHandler` (no ops of its own). Order in the templates:
OJS highlights, `homepage_image`, `categoryHeader`, `homepage_about`
(`about.aboutContext`), announcements, `latest_article.tpl`,
`current_issue`, `additional_content`; OMP highlights, image,
`homepage_about`, `monographList.tpl` for `catalog.featured` "Featured"
(while `displayFeaturedBooks`) and `catalog.newReleases` "New Releases"
(while `displayNewReleases`), announcements, additional content; OPS
highlights, image, announcements, `archiveHeader.tpl`,
`homepage_latest_preprints`, `homepage_about`, additional content. The
Highlights spec's claim check confirmed the carousel's place and the
parts below it (2026-09-16). `additionalHomeContent` is assigned by the
index handlers alone.

<a id="fn-n"></a>
**n — "Latest Publications".** OJS `IndexHandler`, option
`RECENT_PUBLISHED`: `Repo::submission()->getCollector()->filterByLatestPublished(true)`
(OJS `APP\submission\Collector`: the current publication published, with
a publication date, and either no issue or an unpublished one), no
`orderBy()` call, so the collector's default `dateSubmitted DESC`; paged
by a `LengthAwarePaginator` of `itemsPerPage`. `latest_article.tpl`:
heading `submissions.published.latest` "Latest Publications",
`{page_info}` (`navigation.items` "{$from} - {$to} of {$total} items",
printed whenever there is a page) and `{page_links}`
(`PKPTemplateManager::smartyPageLinks()`: `&lt;&lt;` `&lt;` before, the
numbers from `page - floor(numPageLinks / 2)`, `&gt;` `&gt;&gt;` after,
nothing on a single page). Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-o"></a>
**o — the organization, the current issue and the categories.**
`JournalContentOption::default()`: `ISSUE_TOC` when any issue of the
journal exists (`Repo::issue()` collector `exists()`, published or not),
else `RECENT_PUBLISHED`, and `ISSUE_TOC` when no journal is in the
request. `IndexHandler` reads `$activeTheme->getOption('journalContentOrganization')`
and uses `default()` when it is not an array. `CATEGORY_LISTING`: the
journal's categories, printed by `categoryHeader.tpl` for those without a
parent, each linking `catalog/category/{path}`. `ISSUE_TOC`:
`Repo::issue()->getCurrent()` and `publishingMode !=
PUBLISHING_MODE_NONE` (`AccessForm`, `manager.distribution.publishingMode.none`),
then `IssueHandler::setupIssueTemplate()`; labels `journal.currentIssue`
"Current Issue", `journal.viewAllIssues` "View All Issues" (to
`issue/archive`). Seen 2026-09-23: "Publishing Mode" shows no choice
marked on a new journal (seed-facts).

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p — "Latest preprints".** OPS `IndexHandler::index()`: published
submissions of the server, `orderBy(ORDERBY_DATE_PUBLISHED)` descending,
`limit(10)`, no paginator; the publication date carries no time, so
preprints posted the same day tie and the database picks their order.
`indexServer.tpl` prints the heading `index.latestPreprints` "Latest
preprints" and a `<ul>` of `preprint_summary.tpl` unconditionally. The
search box and category links come from `archiveHeader.tpl` (the
Sections feature's archive header).

<a id="fn-q"></a>
**q — the homepage image.** OJS `indexJournal.tpl`: `<div
class="homepage_image"><img … alt="{$homepageImage.altText}">` when set
(the `alt` omitted when empty), the image styled to the column's width;
OMP `index.tpl` and OPS `indexServer.tpl`: a bare `<img …
alt="{$homepageImageAltText|escape}">`, a variable OMP's handler never
assigns and OPS's reads from `homepageImageAltText`, a setting the
context schema lacks (it stores the text as `homepageImage.altText`), so
`alt` is always empty. All three skip the image while
`useHomepageImageAsHeader` is on. `DefaultThemePlugin::init()` adds the
inline style `.pkp_structure_head { background: center / cover no-repeat
url("…"); }` on every page of the context when the option is on and the
context has a localized `homepageImage`. Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rules
8, 18; all three apps): with the header option ticked, the header's
background was the picture on the home, About and item pages and the
home page body had none; unticked, the picture was back in the body;
removed and saved with the option still ticked, the header was plain
colour again. In a 1280-pixel window with an 860-pixel main column, a
300 × 100 picture showed 860 × 287 on a journal and 300 × 100 on a press
and a server; a 2000 × 400 picture 860 × 172 and 800 × 160.

<a id="fn-r"></a>
**r — logo, thumbnail, footer.** `header.tpl`: `{if
$displayPageHeaderLogo}` an `<a class="is_img">` with the uploaded file,
its `width` and `height`, and `alt` only when `altText != ''`; `{elseif
$displayPageHeaderTitle}` the name as text (`PKPTemplateManager` assigns
both from the context). The thumbnail: each app's `indexSite.tpl`, `alt`
only when set. `footer.tpl`: `{if $pageFooter}` a `pkp_footer_content`
block before `pkp_brand_footer`. Seen 2026-09-23 in passing on all three
apps: a header logo uploaded without alternate text rendered with no
`alt`.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s — the sidebar.** `PKPAppearanceSetupForm` offers
`PluginRegistry::loadCategory('blocks', true)` (the enabled block plugins,
the custom blocks included) by `getDisplayName()`. ui-library
`FieldOptions.vue::mounted()` sorts the options by their index in the
saved value, unsaved ones last; `Orderer.vue` gives the arrows
`common.orderUp` "Increase position of {$itemTitle}" and
`common.orderDown` "Decrease position of {$itemTitle}"; the watcher on
`selectedValue` filters the value to the offered options only when the
list changes. `PKPTemplateManager::displaySidebar()` prints the saved
names in order, skipping names not among the enabled blocks; `footer.tpl`
prints the `pkp_structure_sidebar` column only when that output is
non-empty, and `header.tpl` adds `has_sidebar` from `hasSidebar`.
`PKPContextService::validate()` refuses a saved name that is not an
enabled block (`manager.setup.layout.sidebar.invalidBlock`, filled with
the saved registry name, such as `languagetoggleblockplugin`). Enabled on
a new context by each plugin's `settings.xml`: OJS `information`,
`languageToggle`, `subscription`, OMP `browse`, `information`,
`languageToggle`, OPS `languageToggle`; the generic `webFeed` true in all
three; `developedBy` false. `makeSubmission` is not enabled on a new
context: no `enabled` row exists for it on any context, `publicknowledge`
included. Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rules 23–25; all three apps): the
"Sidebar" lists of new contexts as Rule 23 quotes them, on four scratch
contexts per app.

<a id="fn-t"></a>
**t — style sheet and favicon.** `PKPTemplateManager::initialize()`: the
context's `styleSheet` is added as `contextStylesheet` with
`STYLE_SEQUENCE_LATE` and the default `contexts` (`frontend` only), its
address carrying `?d={dateUploaded}` on OJS and OPS and `?v=3.6.0.0` on
OMP; the favicon (`Context::getLocalizedFavicon()`, the current locale
then the primary) as a `<link rel="icon">` header in the `frontend` and
`backend` contexts. Code read 2026-09-24. Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule
26; all three apps): a style sheet whose one rule colours every heading
red was the last style sheet in the page head; the home page's headings
turned red while the item page's "Published" ("Posted") and "Versions"
labels kept the theme's grey; the Dashboard and Settings › Website did
not load it.

<a id="fn-u"></a>
**u — "Editorial Masthead".** `PKPAppearanceMastheadForm`:
`mastheadUserGroupIds` (`FieldOptions`, `isOrderable`, `allowOnlySorting`,
the value every listed id) and the `FieldHTML` `reviewer`
(`user.role.reviewers`, `manager.setup.editorialMasthead.order.reviewers.description`),
added on every app. `Repo::userGroup()->getSortedMastheadUserGroups()`:
the context's groups with `masthead` true, the reviewer role excluded,
ordered by role id, then by the saved order with unsaved groups last;
with no saved order, the role-id order alone, so a newly ticked group
takes its level's place. `registry/userGroups.xml` sets `masthead="true"`
on the editor, section editor, external reviewer and editorial board
member groups (OJS, OMP) and on the section editor and editorial board
member groups (OPS); OMP's internal reviewer group has none. The Journal
identity spec live-probed the order's effect on 2026-09-23.

<a id="fn-v"></a>
**v — where "Lists" applies.** Each app's `TemplateManager` assigns the
context's `itemsPerPage` and `numPageLinks` to the frontend.
`{page_links}` (numbered) is used by OJS `latest_article.tpl`, each app's
`frontend/pages/search.tpl` and the OJS and OPS `catalogCategory.tpl`;
OMP's `catalogCategory.tpl` prints no page links; the listing pages'
`pagination.tpl` prints "Previous" / "Next" only.
`PKPHandler::getRangeInfo()` takes the context's `itemsPerPage` as the
page size of every paged grid (`PagingFeature`, for example the Roles
grid; `gridPaging.tpl` adds an "Items per page:" select); the Comments
page's list uses it too (`userComment\Repository`). The "Users" list on
Settings › Users & Roles is a Vue list that asks 25 a page
(`count=25`), and the Dashboard's submission list 30. Code read
2026-09-24; the listing pages were live-probed by the Navigation menus
spec on 2026-09-23.

<a id="fn-w"></a>
**w — where the formats print.** `PKPTemplateManager` assigns the
context's formats to the frontend and to the editorial page context.
`dateFormatShort`: OJS `article_details.tpl`, `issue_toc.tpl` and the
search results' `article_summary.tpl`; OPS `preprint_details.tpl`,
`preprint_summary.tpl`; lib/pkp `announcement_full.tpl`,
`announcement_summary.tpl`, `announcements_list.tpl`. `dateFormatLong`:
OMP `monograph_full.tpl`, `monograph_summary.tpl`, `chapter.tpl`. The
date-and-time formats: lib/pkp `controllers/informationCenter/note.tpl`
and the library file forms print `datetimeFormatShort`;
`workflow/reviewHistory.tpl` and `authorDashboard/submissionEmails.tpl`
name the date-and-time formats too, but none of the screens driven on 2026-09-24
printed "Date & Time" (the long one), and a review's history was not
reached. The Announcements spec live-probed "Date (Short)" on
announcement dates (2026-09-17).

<a id="fn-x"></a>
**x — the wizard's organization.** `DefaultThemePlugin::init()` computes
the `journalContentOrganization` default with the request's context;
the wizard runs at the site's address (`index/admin/wizard/{id}`), where
the request has no journal, so `JournalContentOption::default()` returns
`ISSUE_TOC`. `PKPThemeForm` shows `value ?? default`, and the theme
form's save posts every field, so what the wizard shows is stored. The
wizard's theme save goes to the edited context's theme endpoint, which
admits a Site Administrator with no role in that context. Code read
2026-09-24. Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 34; OJS4; two runs): on a
scratch journal with no issue the wizard ticked the current issue and
the journal's own tab its recent articles; a wizard save with only
"Colour" changed left the own tab on the current issue and the home
page without its articles; with a published issue both screens ticked
the current issue. On a press and a server the wizard's fields equalled
the own tab's and its save reached the public header.

<a id="fn-y"></a>
**y — languages.** The logo, thumbnail, homepage image, favicon, footer
and additional content are `isMultilingual`; the public pages read them
with `getLocalizedData()`, which falls back to the primary locale and
then to any locale holding a value (live-probed 2026-09-24 with a
French-only footer), and the favicon with `getLocalizedFavicon()`. `PKPDateTimeForm`'s fields are
multilingual, one choice per form locale, and `getLocalizedDateFormat…()`
read the visitor's locale. A context without `supportedFormLocales` has
the primary language alone under "Forms" (scenarios.md).

<a id="fn-z"></a>
**z — the statistics chart.** `displayStats` is read by OJS
`article_details.tpl`, OMP `monograph_full.tpl` and OPS
`preprint_details.tpl` (`!= 'none'`), which call
`ThemePlugin::displayUsageStatsGraph()` and print
`plugins.themes.default.displayStats.downloads` "Downloads" and
`…noStats` "Download data is not yet available.". Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-sc"></a>
**sc — the scenarios' givens.** Where each scenario runs: every one on
scratch contexts from `POST scenarios/context` (`pkpApi.createContext()`,
`scenarios.md`), each with a throwaway manager in `users[]` (`roles:
['manager']`, password the username twice); `admin` / `admin`
(`docs/process/users.md`) is the Site Administrator, enrolled as a
manager in every context the API creates. A scratch context arrives with
English alone under "UI" and "Forms", no block placed, ""Developed By"
Block" disabled, no issue and no category, "Publishing Mode" unmarked,
and every appearance field at the install default (`seed-facts.md`). The
visitor is a fresh signed-out browser context. Pictures, the style sheet
and the favicon are test fixtures uploaded on screen; the "Date & Time"
labels follow the browser's clock, so a test pins it or computes the
expected strings from today. Recipes: 1 — `context.description` (the
"Journal Summary"); the style sheet's one rule colours `h1`–`h6` red. 2
— nothing seeded; the wizard is `admin`'s. 3 — nothing seeded; the
site's home page lists every context of the install, so the test finds
the scratch journal's row. 4 — nothing seeded: the plugin is ticked on
screen. 5 — `users[]` with `editor`, `sectionEditor` and
`editorialBoardMember` (OPS `sectionEditor` and `editorialBoardMember`),
each current, and one more account per role with the role in
`pastRoles[]`; "Production editor" and "Layout Editor" are
`productionEditor` and `layoutEditor`, ticked on screen. 6 — OJS three
`POST scenarios/submission` seeds with `published: true` and no `issue`;
OPS eleven with `published: true`. 7 — `enableAnnouncements: true`,
`numAnnouncementsHomepage: 1`, `announcements: [{title: 'Call for
papers'}]`; OMP one submission with `published: true`. 8 —
`context.supportedLocales` and `context.supportedFormLocales` `['en',
'fr_CA']` and the announcement keys of 7; the French page is the
journal's address with the `fr_CA` segment. 9 — two submissions with
`published: true` and no `issue`; `categories: [{path: 'arts', title:
'Arts'}, {path: 'science', title: 'Science', children: [{path:
'physics', title: 'Physics'}]}]`. 10 — `issues: [{volume: 1, number: 1,
year: 2026, published: true}]`.

<a id="fn-f-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — OJS `aa7d5a8648` (2019-04-21, "corrected alt text source for
homepageImage") and `e7c66ecb3c` (2019-05-14) moved the journal's page to
`$homepageImage.altText`; OMP `d9ffc0c1e` (2019-05-14) and OPS (renamed
from the journal's template in `c8046900c3`, 2021-02-14) kept
`$homepageImageAltText`, see note q. Live-probed 2026-09-24 on all three
apps: typed "Home picture" (and "Our building"), the journal's picture
read the typed text, the press's and the server's `alt=""`; the tab
still held the text after a reload.

<a id="fn-f-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — Seen 2026-09-23 in passing on all three apps (twice): the
header logo without alternate text had no `alt`; note r.

<a id="fn-f-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — `FieldOptions.vue` wraps the box, its label and the `Orderer`
arrows in one `<label>`, so a box's accessible name takes both arrows'
screen-reader texts ("{block} Increase position of {block} Decrease
position of {block}"). Live-probed 2026-09-24 on all three apps: on
"Editorial Masthead" (`allowOnlySorting`, no box) the up button
`orderer__up`, whose own screen-reader text is "Increase position of
{role}", sits inside `label.pkpFormField--options__option` and is
announced "{role} Decrease position of {role}".

<a id="fn-f-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — Note s: the stored value keeps the disabled block's name, the
list filters it only when changed, and the save's validation refuses it.
Live-probed 2026-09-24 on all three apps with "Language Toggle Block"
and with a custom block ("Custom Block Manager" disabled): a "Page
Footer" save answered 400 with the message under "Sidebar" and "Please
correct one error. Go to Sidebar: … Jump to next error" at the form's
foot; the footer was not saved. The Custom pages & blocks spec drove the
custom-block case the same day (its A15).

<a id="fn-f-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — `PKPContextService::_saveFileParam()` with a `null` value
removes the stored file by `$isImage ? $setting['uploadName'] : $setting`;
the style sheet is saved with `$isImage` false but stored as an object
(`name`, `uploadName`, `dateUploaded`), so the path handed to
`PKPPublicFileManager::removeContextFile()` ends in the array's string
form and nothing is deleted. Live-probed 2026-09-24 on all three apps:
after "Remove" and "Saved", the pages no longer linked the style sheet,
and its old address (`/public/journals/<id>/styleSheet.css`, OMP
`presses`, OPS `contexts`) still answered 200 with the file, signed out;
a removed favicon's and logo's addresses answered 404.

<a id="fn-f-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — Seen 2026-09-24 on all three apps with the French interface.
OJS `locale/fr_CA` lacks `manager.setup.journalContentOrganization` and
its description and option keys; OMP's `plugins/themes/default/locale/fr_CA/locale.po`
holds one entry and the app's `manager.setup.contextSummary` is empty in
French; OPS's theme locale has empty `displayStats` strings. Code read
2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-f-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 on all three apps ("Logo", "Favicon",
the style sheet): after a ".pdf" picked with "Upload File" the box kept
an empty frame, its "Upload File" and the form's "Save" were disabled,
and the foot line stayed; a picture dropped on the box cleared the
error and enabled both. A file dropped rather than picked is refused
the same way, with nothing sent.

<a id="fn-f-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — Note j: the label is luxon's rendering of `g:ia`, the pages
PHP's. Live-probed 2026-09-24 on all three apps: the choice read
"7:35PM" at that time; saved, a library file's "Date uploaded" read
"2026-09-24 7:17pm" and a file's note "2026-09-24 7:17pm".

<a id="fn-f-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — Note j. Live-probed 2026-09-24 on all three apps, two runs:
the save stored `datetimeFormatShort` as "h:i A" for the language
saved; the tab then showed "2026-09-24" marked under "Date (Short)" and
"Custom" with "h:i A" under "Date & Time (Short)"; a library file's "Date
uploaded" read "07:17 PM" (all three) and a file's note "admin admin
07:17 PM" (OJS, OMP).

<a id="fn-f-ojs1"></a>
**f-ojs1** — `journalContentOrganization` is added by OJS's
`DefaultThemePlugin` alone; OMP and OPS index handlers read no such
option (note m). Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-f-ojs2"></a>
**f-ojs2** — Note o: the default is computed on every request from
whether any issue exists; nothing stores it when the journal is created
(the theme's `settings.xml` holds `enabled` alone). Code read 2026-09-24.
Live-probed 2026-09-24: a scratch journal with "Theme" never saved and
one article published with no issue showed it under "Latest
Publications"; after Issues › "Create Issue" › "Save" (not published)
the home page was empty and "Theme" ticked the current issue; after
"Publish Issue" it showed "Current Issue" with the issue and no
articles, and still not the article.

<a id="fn-f-ojs3"></a>
**f-ojs3** — Note n. The label is OJS's
`manager.setup.journalContentOrganization.option.recentPublished`
"Include recent most published articles". Code read 2026-09-24.
Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 13): articles A, B, C published with no
issue listed C, B, A; an article in the published issue was absent; an
article submitted before them and published last sat at the bottom; an
article published at once into an issue not yet published headed the
list.

<a id="fn-f-ojs4"></a>
**f-ojs4** — Note x. Code read 2026-09-24; live-probed 2026-09-24, two
runs (note x).

<a id="fn-f-ojs5"></a>
**f-ojs5** — Note o: `IndexHandler` uses `JournalContentOption::default()`
whenever the stored option is not an array, and the tab sends an empty
value when nothing is ticked. Live-probed 2026-09-24 on two scratch
journals with an issue, two runs: "Saved", the tab reopened with
"Include the current issue's table of contents" ticked, and the home
page showed "Current Issue".

<a id="fn-f-ojs6"></a>
**f-ojs6** — `latest_article.tpl` passes `heading=$articleHeading`,
which nothing assigns there, so `article_summary.tpl` falls back to `h2`.
Live-probed 2026-09-24: "Latest Publications" a level-2 heading and each
article title level 2; under "Current Issue", "Articles" level 3 and
each article level 4.

<a id="fn-f-ojs7"></a>
**f-ojs7** — Note q: the journal's template omits `alt` when the text is
empty. Live-probed 2026-09-24: a journal's homepage image saved with the
box empty had no `alt` attribute.

<a id="fn-f-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — OMP `AppearanceSetupForm`, `AppearanceAdvancedForm` and
`DefaultThemePlugin` (notes e, f, h); the catalog reads
`catalogSortOption` (`CatalogListPanel`, `CatalogHandler`) and
`showCatalogSeriesListing` (`catalog.tpl`). Code read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-f-omp2"></a>
**f-omp2** — Note v: OMP's `catalogCategory.tpl` prints no page links.
Live-probed 2026-09-24, two runs: at "Items per page" 1 a press category
holding three books showed "3 Titles" and one book with no page links,
while the catalog showed one book with "Next"; on a journal and a
server a category of two items read "1 - 1 of 2 items 1 2 > >>".

<a id="fn-f-ops1"></a>
**f-ops1** — OPS `IndexHandler::index()` and `indexServer.tpl` (notes m,
p): no option but `showDescriptionInServerIndex` shapes the page. Code
read 2026-09-24.

<a id="fn-td1"></a>
**td1** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Actors rows 1–2; Actors preamble; all
three apps): as a scratch journal's manager one change on each of
"Theme", "Setup", "Editorial Masthead", "Advanced", "Lists" and "Date &
Time" showed "Saved"; the Editor and Production Editor (OJS, OMP) and
`admin` saved "Lists" alike. `sectioneditor.ana`, `assistant.rita`,
`reviewer.julia`, `author.alex` and `reader.rosa` had no "Settings" group
and the typed address answered the access-denied page; signed out, the
Login page. `admin` with the manager role ended on a scratch press or
server got the access-denied page there; on a scratch journal the page
loaded under the "Error" window, raised by a dashboard count request
answering 401. Two runs.

<a id="fn-td2"></a>
**td2** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Actors row 2; Rule 34; all three apps,
two runs): the manager, Editor, Production Editor and every lower role
typing the wizard's or Hosted Journals' address got the access-denied
page, and only `admin`'s side menu had "Administration". In the wizard
"Colour" set to "#1B5E20" and saved showed "Saved", the journal's own
"Theme" tab then read it, and the public header was that green on the
next load; the same with `admin` holding no role in the journal.

<a id="fn-td3"></a>
**td3** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Fields, the upload boxes; all three
apps): a ".pdf" on "Logo" and "Favicon" and a ".png" on the style sheet,
each by the file chooser and by a drop, showed "You can't upload files of
this type." and sent nothing. A logo uploaded to an empty box showed
"Remove" and no "Restore Original"; on a box holding a saved logo,
"Remove" or a new upload (set on the box's hidden file input) added
"Restore Original", which brought back the saved logo with "Journal
logo". A new homepage image put in place of one saved with "Our
building" arrived with the box empty. An unsaved upload did not reach
the visitor's header. Test run 2026-09-24 (Fields, the upload boxes;
scenario 3): ui-library `FieldUploadImage.vue` wraps the dropzone and its
"Upload File" in `<div :class="{'-screenReader': currentValue}">`, so a
box holding a picture shows neither; a mouse click on the button landed
on the preview (OMP). On the tab loaded again with a saved logo the
button was enabled (OJS), and focus plus Enter opened the file chooser,
the upload answering 200 with "Alternate text" empty and "Restore
Original" shown (OMP, OPS); after "Remove" the button was visible and
the upload went through (OJS). Seen once on OJS: right after a logo was
uploaded and saved in the same visit, the hidden button was disabled.

<a id="fn-td4"></a>
**td4** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 {OMP}: on a new press "Featured Books"
and "New Releases" were unticked, no "Order of monographs" choice was
marked, and the cover sizes read 106 and 100; both boxes ticked and
saved with no book featured or new, the home page gained no heading.
"0" in a cover box was refused, "abc" too, and 1 × 1 and 5000 × 5000
saved. On the catalog "Order Features" › "Save Order" turned "Featured"
from M1, M2 to M2, M1, while "New Releases" kept M1, M2.

<a id="fn-td5"></a>
**td5** — Live-probed 2026-09-24: a new preprint server's "Editorial
Masthead" shows the "Reviewers" heading and note, as a journal's and a
press's do.

<a id="fn-td6"></a>
**td6** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Fields, "Lists"; all three apps):
"Items per page" emptied, "This field is required." with nothing sent;
"0" and "-1", "This must be at least 1."; "abc" and "2.5", "This is not a
valid integer."; each with "Please correct one error. Go to Items per
page: … Jump to next error" at the foot; "Page links" the same. 100000
in both boxes saved.

<a id="fn-td7"></a>
**td7** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Fields, "Date & Time"; all three apps):
with the browser's clock set to 24 September 2026 at 15:05 the choices
read as Fields quotes them, the third "Time" choice "3:05PM"; a browser
at UTC+14, while the server read 19:13 UTC on 24 September, showed
"September 25, 2026" and "09:13 AM": the labels follow the manager's
computer.

<a id="fn-td8"></a>
**td8** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 2; all three apps, two runs):
note c.

<a id="fn-td9"></a>
**td9** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 3; all three apps, two runs): on
a journal with English and French forms, an English-only logo, homepage
image, favicon and "Additional Content" showed to the French visitor;
a French-only "Page Footer" ("Pied de page") showed to both, and with
"English footer" added each language read its own; a French "Date
(Short)" of "24.09.2026" printed "Publié 24.09.2026" on the French
item page against "2026-09-24" in English.

<a id="fn-td10"></a>
**td10** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 4; all three apps): the "Theme"
list offered "Default Theme" alone; after "#FFFF00" and "Lora/Open
Sans" were saved the Dashboard's header and font were unchanged;
Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Navigation", "Add Menu", offered the
areas "None", "primary" and "user".

<a id="fn-td11"></a>
**td11** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rules 5, 6; all three apps): "Lora/Open
Sans" set headings in Lora and text in Open Sans; "Lato" both Lato;
"Noto Serif/Noto Sans" headings Noto Serif, text Noto Sans. "#FFFF00"
gave a yellow header with dark links, "#000080" a navy header with
white links, on the home, item, list and About pages. "red" and
"#12345" typed over "#000080" and saved: the tab reopened on "#000080"
and the header stayed navy. Test run 2026-09-24 (Rule 5; scenario 2;
all three apps): a new journal's and press's home page has no heading
in its body, its one `h1` being the header's screen-reader copy of the
name, in the text's font; with "Lora/Open Sans" saved, the header's name
link (`.pkp_site_name a`) read Lora and the text Open Sans there, and
the "About" page's heading read Lora; on OPS "Latest preprints" read
Lora too.

<a id="fn-td12"></a>
**td12** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 7; all three apps): ticked with
a summary set, the home page gained "About the Journal" ("About the
Press", "About the Server") holding the text, and the skip link to it;
unticked, the section went.

<a id="fn-td13"></a>
**td13** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 8; all three apps): note q.
Ticked with no homepage image, the header kept its colour.

<a id="fn-td14"></a>
**td14** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 9; all three apps, two runs):
the bar and the line choice each added a "Downloads" heading and a
chart to the article, book and preprint pages; with no downloads the
chart was empty, and "Download data is not yet available." never
showed (the test installs process no usage logs); "Do not display…"
removed both.

<a id="fn-td15"></a>
**td15** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 10; OJS): a scratch journal with
no issue ticked "Include recent most published articles" alone; one
with an unpublished issue, and the seeded journal, "Include the current
issue's table of contents" alone.

<a id="fn-td16"></a>
**td16** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rules 11, 12; all three apps): a
scratch context with every part set showed them in the table's order;
a new one with nothing set showed nothing between the header and the
footer on a journal and a press, and the search box over an empty
"Latest preprints" on a server. The journal's address with and without
`/index` shows the same page, and the header's name leads there.

<a id="fn-td17"></a>
**td17** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 13; OJS): note f-ojs3 for the
entries; "1 - 3 of 3 items" at the defaults. At "Items per page" 1 and
"Page links" 2: page 1 "1 - 1 of 4 items 1 2 > >>", page 2 "2 - 2 of 4
items << < 1 2 > >>", the last "4 - 4 of 4 items << < 3 4". With no
such article the section was absent.

<a id="fn-td18"></a>
**td18** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 14; Settings bullet 25; OJS):
"Current Issue", "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)", "Published: 2026-09-24", the
table of contents and "View All Issues" to the archive; unticked, the
section went. "Publishing Mode" set to "OJS will not be used to publish
the journal's contents online." and saved removed the section and
nothing else; set back to open access, it returned.

<a id="fn-td19"></a>
**td19** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 15; OJS): the row read "K2 Arts",
"K2 Science", without the subcategory "K2 Sub"; "K2 Arts" opened that
category's page. With no category the row was absent.

<a id="fn-td20"></a>
**td20** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 16; OPS): the heading over an
empty list with nothing posted; with eleven preprints posted the same
day, ten listed with no page links, at the default and at "Items per
page" 1, in a different order and a different ten on two runs (note p),
while the preprint list showed one with "Next" at 1.

<a id="fn-td21"></a>
**td21** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 18; all three apps): the picture
right under the carousel; its sizes and text alternatives in notes q and
f-a1; saved with the box empty on a journal, no text alternative (OJS7).

<a id="fn-td22"></a>
**td22** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 19; all three apps): "Welcome
text" was the last part of the home page and on no other page read
(About, the archive or catalog or preprint list, an item's page, the
announcements page).

<a id="fn-td23"></a>
**td23** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 20; A2; all three apps): a 300 ×
80 logo with "Journal logo" replaced the name on the home and About
pages at 300 × 80 and led to the home page; a 1600 × 160 logo showed at
800 × 80. With the box emptied the logo had no text alternative and the
link no name. "Remove" and "Save" brought the name back. A French
visitor saw the English logo with "Journal logo" until a French one was
saved.

<a id="fn-td24"></a>
**td24** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 21; all three apps): the
thumbnail showed as a linked picture above the journal's name on the
site's home page, its text alternative "Thumb".

<a id="fn-td25"></a>
**td25** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 22; all three apps): "Footer line"
at the foot of the home and About pages, in a block above the
application's logo.

<a id="fn-td26"></a>
**td26** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rules 23, 24; all three apps): no box
ticked on a new context; "Increase position of Language Toggle Block"
moved that row up with nothing sent, and a drag by the handle moved a
row to the top. On a journal with one language, "Language Toggle Block"
and "Web Feed Plugin" ticked showed "Latest publications" alone; with
two languages, "Language" then "Latest publications". Every box unticked
and saved: no sidebar, the 860-pixel content column moved from the left
edge to the middle. ""Developed By" Block" enabled later landed last
among the unticked boxes, and a custom block named "k3-partners" titled
"K3 Partners" read "k3-partners (Custom Block)" among the unticked
boxes. "Browse Block" enabled on a journal and a server added its box
and a "Browse" block.

<a id="fn-td27"></a>
**td27** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 25; A4; all three apps): the
placed "Language Toggle Block" left "Sidebar" and the pages at once when
disabled, and came back ticked and first when enabled again; with a
changed "Sidebar" list saved in between, it came back unticked and last.
The refusal: note f-a4.

<a id="fn-td28"></a>
**td28** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Fields, "Advanced"; Rule 26; A5; all
three apps): note t for the pages, f-a5 for the removal. The box read
"k4-red-headings.css" and "Remove" before "Save", and "styleSheet.css"
(a link to the stored file) when the tab was opened again. Test run
2026-09-24 (Fields, "Advanced"; scenario 1): right after "Saved" the box
still read "red-headings.css" with "Remove" and a disabled "Upload
File", and no link, for 10 to 30 s (OJS two runs, OMP one); with the
page loaded again it read "styleSheet.css" as a link ending
`/styleSheet.css` (all three apps).

<a id="fn-td29"></a>
**td29** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 27; all three apps): a ".png"
favicon was the page icon on the home, item, Dashboard and Settings ›
Website pages; a ".jpg" was refused in the box; with none, the pages
carried no icon link. A French visitor got the English favicon until a
French one was saved.

<a id="fn-td30"></a>
**td30** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 28; all three apps): the
second role's up arrow and "Save" reordered the tab and the headings of
both public pages. "Production editor" ticked on a journal whose tab was
never saved sat second ("Journal editor", "Production editor", "Section
editor", "Editorial Board Member"; a press the same with "Press
editor"); "Layout Editor" ticked after a save sat last. A move left
unsaved survived a side-tab switch and was gone after a reload. The
arrows' names: note f-a3.

<a id="fn-td31"></a>
**td31** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 29; all three apps): at "Items
per page" 1 the archive, catalog and preprint list, "Latest
Publications", the Search page and a journal's and a server's category
page showed one entry a page; the "Users" list showed all five users
("Showing 1 to 5 of 5") and the "Roles" list one role ("1 - 1 of 18
items 1 2 3 > >>").

<a id="fn-td32"></a>
**td32** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 30; all three apps): with 13
items at 1 a page, "Latest Publications" {OJS} and the Search page read
"1 - 1 of 13 items 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 > >>" on page 1 and "7 - 7 of 13
items << < 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 > >>" on page 7 with "Page links" 10,
and "1 2 3 > >>" and "<< < 6 7 8 > >>" with 3; the archive, catalog and
preprint list showed "Previous" and "Next" alone at either number.

<a id="fn-td33"></a>
**td33** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 31; all three apps): with
"24.09.2026" and "24 September 2026" saved, announcements printed
"24.09.2026", an article "Published 24.09.2026" and its issue
"Published: 24.09.2026", a preprint "Posted 24.09.2026", a book
"Published 24 September 2026" and the catalog "24 September 2026". A
file's note and a library file's "Date uploaded" read "2026-09-24 07:17
PM" before, "24.09.2026 07:17 PM" after, and "24.09.2026 19:17" once
"15:05" was saved under "Time".

<a id="fn-td34"></a>
**td34** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 32; all three apps, two runs):
"24-09-2026" under "Date (Short)" rewrote the ready "Date & Time (Short)"
label, still marked; "2026-09-24" back rewrote it to "2026-09-24 07:31
PM", and "Save" stored `Y-m-d h:i A`, marked after the reload, with and
without a save in between; "15:05" under "Time" rewrote both combined
labels and back restored them; a combined group on "Custom" stayed there with its ready
label rewritten.

<a id="fn-td35"></a>
**td35** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 33; all three apps, two runs):
"d/m/Y" printed "24/09/2026" on announcements and item pages and
"24/09/2026 19:17" in editorial dates; "Custom" emptied and saved printed
"2026-09-24" again and the tab reopened with "2026-09-24" marked; the
editorial dates: note f-a9.

<a id="fn-td36"></a>
**td36** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 34; OJS4; all three apps, two
runs): note x. A colour typed in the wizard stayed through its "Journal"
("Press", "Server") tab and back, and was gone after a reload with no
question.

<a id="fn-td37"></a>
**td37** — Live-probed 2026-09-24 (Rule 35; A6; all three apps, two runs):
on OJS the organization field's five codes and nothing else; on OPS
the statistics field's label and three choices; on OMP 23 codes, the
field label "Thème" and its description translated. Note f-a6.
