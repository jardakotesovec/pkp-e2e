# ORCID integration

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

An ORCID iD is a researcher's persistent public identifier. This feature lets
a journal collect **verified** iDs rather than ones typed in on trust. Users connect
an iD to their account from their profile or while registering. Editors ask a
submission's contributors by email to verify theirs. A journal that holds
ORCID **member** credentials also writes back: when an article is published,
its record is added to each verified contributor's ORCID profile, and on a
journal a completed peer review can be added to the reviewer's profile as a
review contribution. Everything is switched on per journal, or once for the
whole site, with API credentials issued by ORCID.

## Actors & permissions

The screens that host an ORCID control (the profile, the workflow's
Contributors list, the Reviewers table) keep their own access rules in their
own features. This table covers only the ORCID capability on each of them.

| Action | Who may — and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Enable & configure ORCID for one journal** | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager: the "ORCID" tab on Settings → Users & Roles (Rule 1). While the site-wide configuration is active, only City, the email toggle and the log level stay editable there (Rule 3) <sup>a</sup> |
| **Enable & configure ORCID site-wide** | • Site Administrator: the "ORCID" side tab on Site Settings, whatever the number of journals the install hosts (Rule 2). The same tab holds the site's "Custom Redirect Base URL" (Rule 2a) <sup>b</sup> |
| **Connect / authorize own iD** | • Any signed-in user: profile, Identity tab (Rules 5–6)<br>• Any visitor: a journal's registration page (Rule 7). Not offered on the site-level registration page <sup>c</sup> |
| **Remove own iD** | • The user themselves, while their iD is verified: "Delete" beside it on the Identity tab (Rule 6c)<br>• ⚠ [A13](#a13) nobody while the iD is unauthenticated: the tab offers no "Delete" for it <sup>d</sup> |
| **Request a contributor's verification by email** | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager; Section Editor assigned to the submission: "Request verification" on the contributor's ORCID iD field (Rule 8)<br>• Author of the submission: the same button, from the submission wizard's Contributors step. On a journal or press the contributor list on the author's own dashboard is read-only. On a preprint server that list offers "Edit" on the author's not-yet-posted preprint, and the form it opens carries the same button (the preprint baseline is described in [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md#ops1))<br>• ⚠ [A5](#a5) an Assistant who can edit the contributor is offered the same button. The request is refused, yet the field reports it as sent <sup>e</sup> |
| **Remove a contributor's iD** | • The same roles as the row above: "Delete" on the contributor's ORCID iD field (Rule 8a) ⚠ [A5](#a5) <sup>e</sup> |
| **Verify via the emailed link** | • Whoever holds the emailed authorization link. It works signed out, and the link is single-use (Rule 9) <sup>f</sup> |
| **Send a review to ORCID** {OJS} | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager; Section Editor: "Send Review To ORCID" on the reviewer's row (Rule 12)<br>• ⚠ [A1](#a1) on a press the Site Administrator, Press Manager and assigned Series Editor are offered the same action, though a press deposits nothing <sup>g</sup> |
| **Read the public ORCID pages** | • Anyone, signed in or out: the "What is ORCID?" page and the verification landing page, reached from links or by URL (Rules 9–10) <sup>f</sup> |

<a id="api-grid-send-review"></a>
**Permission grid: sending a review to ORCID.** The row "Send a review to
ORCID" above, for the route behind the row action's confirmation; the
reviewer's verified iD decides when the action shows, not who has it,
and a press offers it too ([A1](#a1)) (`docs/process/api.md`).

## Fields & validation

Journal ORCID settings ("ORCID" tab, Settings → Users & Roles):

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Enable ORCID functionality" | no | Unchecking hides every ORCID surface for this journal (Rule 4). Checked and locked while the site-wide configuration is active (Rule 3) <sup>a</sup> |
| "ORCID API" | yes (when enabled) | Four choices: Public / Public Sandbox / Member / Member Sandbox. Member unlocks deposits (Rule 11). Sandbox points every ORCID link at ORCID's test service <sup>a</sup> |
| "Client ID" / "Client Secret" | yes (when enabled) | Credentials issued by ORCID. The secret is entered masked. Both are shown read-only, the secret fully masked, while configured site-wide <sup>a</sup> |
| "City" | no | Sent as the review venue on review deposits. A review deposit silently requires both this and the journal's country to be set (Rule 12) <sup>g</sup> |
| "Send e-mail to request ORCID authorization from authors when an article is accepted ie. sent to copy editing" | no | Turns on the automatic author emails of Rule 13 ⚠ [A6](#a6) |
| "ORCID request log" | no | "Errors" (default) or "All": how much of the feature's activity goes to the application log, a server file no screen shows (Side effects). ⚠ [A16](#a16) "All" writes the feature's informational entries in place of its errors, not both <sup>a</sup> |

Site ORCID settings ("ORCID" side tab, Administration › Site Settings):

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Enable ORCID functionality site-wide" | no | Ticked and saved, it turns ORCID on for every journal with the credentials below and locks each journal's own tab (Rules 2–3) <sup>b</sup> |
| "Custom Redirect Base URL" | no | Described "A custom base URL used when constructing ORCID redirect URLs. This can be applied site-wide without enabling the above site-wide ORCID settings override as this setting is only applicable at a site level." A web address such as "https://example.com/"; anything else is refused under the field with "This is not a valid URL." and nothing is saved. Saved empty, the stored value is removed. What a value changes: Rule 2a <sup>b</sup> |
| "ORCID API" / "Client ID" / "Client Secret" | yes (when the box is ticked) | Shown only while the box is ticked, under "Custom Redirect Base URL". "ORCID API" offers the same four choices as the journal's tab <sup>b</sup> |

City, the email toggle and the log level have no site-wide field. They
remain per-journal. <sup>b</sup>

Contributor's ORCID iD field (add/edit contributor, Contributors list):

| State | What the field shows |
|-------|----------------------|
| No iD | A "Request verification" button. Pressing it asks "Would you like to send an email to this author requesting they verify their ORCID?" For a contributor being added, the dialog adds "The email will be sent once the author has been created." After sending, the button is disabled and reads "ORCID Verification has been requested!", with a "Resend Verification Email" link beside it (Rule 8) <sup>e</sup> |
| Unauthenticated iD | The iD as a link, the hollow ORCID icon, and the note "This ORCID has not been verified. Please remove this unverified ORCID and request verification from the user/author directly." plus "Delete" <sup>e</sup> |
| Verified iD | The iD as a link with the solid ORCID icon, plus "Delete" (confirmation before removal) <sup>e</sup> |

## Rules & state

1. **Per-journal switch.** ORCID is off until a Journal Manager enables it on
   the "ORCID" tab and saves credentials. Every rule below assumes it is on
   for the journal at hand. The tab is always present, enabled or not. A
   tick or a City left unsaved on the tab survives a trip to another tab
   of Users & Roles and back, and is dropped without a question when the
   manager leaves Users & Roles for another page. <sup>a</sup>
2. **Site-wide switch.** The Site Administrator's Site Settings
   (Administration › Site Settings) carry an "ORCID" side tab, the last
   one under "Site Setup", whatever the number of journals the install
   hosts. Its box "Enable ORCID functionality site-wide" enables ORCID
   **for every journal at once** with one set of credentials. What the
   tab shows in the French interface: Rule 17. <sup>b</sup>
   2a. **The site's own return address.** The same tab holds "Custom
   Redirect Base URL", for a site whose ORCID credentials are registered
   with one return address for all its journals. With a value saved,
   every ORCID link the site builds sends the browser back to an address
   starting with that value instead of the site's own address: the
   "Create or Connect your ORCID iD" popup on the profile and on the
   registration page, and the authorization link of the request emails
   (Rule 14). With "https://example.com/" or "https://example.com"
   saved, the "redirect_uri" part of the ORCID sign-in address those
   links open starts "https://example.com/". The value applies whether or not the
   site-wide box is ticked, and it leaves the journals' own ORCID tabs
   editable. Saved empty, the links use the site's own address again. <sup>b</sup>
3. Site-wide configuration overrides the journals. Each journal's tab then
   shows "Enable ORCID functionality" checked and locked, the API type and
   Client ID read-only, the secret masked, and a note ending "Contact your
   site administrator to disable ORCID functionality or change these
   credentials." City, the email toggle and the log level stay editable per
   journal. ⚠ [A17](#a17) pressing "Save" to change one of them also
   switches the journal's own ORCID on, so a journal that had it off keeps
   it on, with no Client ID, once the site-wide box is unticked. Unticking
   the site-wide box and saving gives each journal its own API type,
   Client ID and secret back, editable again. <sup>b</sup>
4. **Disabled means invisible.** With ORCID off for a journal, the profile's
   Identity tab shows no ORCID field at all, the registration page shows no
   ORCID block, and the contributor form has no ORCID iD field. <sup>c</sup>
5. **Connecting from the profile.** On the Identity tab of an ORCID-enabled
   journal an ORCID block appears. What it holds depends on the account's iD.
   With no iD: a "Create or Connect your ORCID iD" button. With an
   unauthenticated iD: the iD as a hollow-icon link suffixed
   "(unauthenticated)" and an "Authorize and Connect your ORCID iD" button,
   but no "Delete" (Rule 6c). With a verified iD: only the iD as a
   solid-icon link and its "Delete" button; the connect button and the
   "What is ORCID?" link beside it are gone. The connect/authorize button
   opens ORCID's sign-in in a popup window. Completing it closes the popup,
   stores the verified iD and reloads the tab. ⚠ [A18](#a18) when the
   journal's server then cannot reach ORCID, or ORCID fails on its own
   side (not Rule 6d's refusal), the popup instead stays open on a blank
   page, the tab under it says nothing, and nothing is stored.
   <sup>c</sup> <sup>h</sup>
6. Companions of the profile flow:
   6a. ⚠ [A4](#a4) the "What is ORCID?" link beside the button opens the same
   sign-in popup instead of the What-is-ORCID page it names. <sup>c</sup>
   6b. Denying access on ORCID's consent screen from a verification email
   records the refusal where no screen shows it and voids the link, stale
   from then on (Rule 9); an iD the contributor already held stays
   unverified. A denial from the profile's popup goes unrecognised: the
   app asks ORCID for a token anyway, unseen, and the Identity tab is
   unchanged; with ORCID unreachable the popup stays blank [A18](#a18). <sup>f</sup>
   6c. "Delete" beside a verified iD opens a window titled "Confirm" that
   asks "Are you sure you want to remove this ORCID?", with "OK" and
   "Cancel". "OK" removes the iD at once, with no separate save, and tells
   ORCID to cancel this install's access token. ⚠ [A19](#a19) changes
   typed into the tab's other boxes and not saved are discarded by "OK",
   without a question. ⚠ [A13](#a13) an unauthenticated iD has no
   "Delete", so its owner cannot remove it from the profile. <sup>d</sup>
   6d. When ORCID refuses the journal's credentials at the end of the
   sign-in (a wrong Client Secret), the popup closes and the
   profile shows a notice opening "ORCID authorization failed:". No iD is
   stored, and the "Create or Connect your ORCID iD" button stays. <sup>c</sup>
7. **Connecting while registering.** A journal's registration page offers the
   same "Create or Connect your ORCID iD" button at the top of the form.
   Connecting is never required to register. In Rule 5's failure, and
   also when ORCID refuses the journal's credentials (Rule 6d), the popup
   stays open on a blank page and the form says nothing: no "ORCID
   authorization failed:" notice appears here [A18](#a18). <sup>i</sup>
   - Completing ORCID's sign-in fills the name, email, country and
     affiliation fields from the ORCID record, hides the button and keeps
     the iD in a hidden field. ⚠ [A3](#a3) the account created afterwards
     holds the iD unauthenticated, so the new user is offered "Authorize
     and Connect" again on their profile. <sup>p</sup>
8. **Contributor verification requests.** On the contributor form, "Request
   verification" emails that contributor an authorization link (Rule 14
   chooses the email). The button then reads "ORCID Verification has been
   requested!" with a "Resend Verification Email" link, which asks the same
   question and, once the first email has gone out, sends it again.
   ⚠ [A24](#a24) a resend pressed while the first email still waits to
   go out sends nothing. For a contributor being added, the
   request is remembered and the email goes out when the contributor is
   saved.
   8a. "Delete" beside a contributor's iD (verified or not) removes it after
   confirmation and asks ORCID to cancel its token, a request no screen
   shows; ⚠ [A20](#a20) for an unauthenticated iD too, which holds none. <sup>e</sup>
9. **The emailed link and the verification landing.** The emailed
   authorization link leads to ORCID's sign-in. ORCID then returns the
   browser to the journal's "ORCID Authorization" page, which answers one
   of these: <sup>f</sup>
   - On success: the verified iD and "Your ORCID iD has been verified and
     successfully associated with the submission."; after ten seconds the
     page returns the visitor to the journal front page. <sup>o</sup>
   - A link already used to verify, or any link for a contributor whose
     iD is already verified: "An ORCID iD was already stored for this
     submission." <sup>o</sup>
   - A stale or tampered link: "Your ORCID iD could not be verified. The
     link is no longer valid." <sup>f</sup>
   - A visitor who pressed Deny at ORCID: ⚠ [A2](#a2) a raw placeholder
     where the explanation should be. <sup>f</sup>

   Every failure closes with "Please contact the journal manager with your
   name, ORCID iD, and details of your submission." ⚠ [A8](#a8) that line
   says "journal manager" verbatim on presses and preprint servers too. <sup>f</sup>
10. **The What-is-ORCID page.** Every journal's public "What is ORCID?"
    page, linked from the ORCID emails and reachable by URL, explains the iD
    and its use. Only a member-API journal's "How and why" section says
    "publication metadata will automatically be pushed to your ORCID
    record". ⚠ [A15](#a15) the
    browser tab of this page and of the "ORCID Authorization" page (Rule 9)
    reads only "| {journal name}", with no page name before it. <sup>f</sup>
11. **Member API = deposits.** With a Member (or Member Sandbox) API
    configured, publishing an article adds it as a "work" to the ORCID record
    of every contributor holding a verified iD with a live deposit
    permission. "Live" means not expired and not revoked. No screen shows
    liveness; the deposit simply skips the others. Publishing is the
    trigger, and so is scheduling a journal article into an issue not yet
    published ("Schedule For Publication"): the work is sent as soon as
    the article is scheduled, not when its issue is published. Nothing is
    deposited before either. A contributor verified under the public API
    holds no deposit permission. For them the deposit pauses
    and the journal emails a request to re-authorize with the wider
    permission (Rule 14). ⚠ [A14](#a14) that email's link, back from
    ORCID, ends on a blank page because the app fails, so the deposit
    never resumes. Works deposited once are updated in place on later
    publishes. An edit of a published item's metadata ("Title &
    Abstract", "Save") sends nothing, so the work keeps what was
    published ⚠ [A23](#a23).
    [OMP1](#omp1) presses request and verify iDs identically but deposit
    nothing. <sup>j</sup>
12. **Review deposits {OJS}.** On a journal with the member API, a completed
    review can be added to the reviewer's ORCID record as a review
    contribution. The Reviewers table offers "Send Review To ORCID" on the
    row of a reviewer with a verified iD, behind a confirmation ("Send this
    review to the reviewer's ORCID?"). Confirming closes the dialog with no
    on-screen message either way; the deposit runs in the background.
    Publishing the article also deposits its completed reviews. A review
    deposit additionally requires the ORCID settings' City and the
    journal's country. No screen tells the two cases apart: without the
    City it is skipped, ⚠ [OJS1](#ojs1) without the country it fails in the
    background. The row
    action's presence depends on the reviewer's verified iD alone. The member
    API gates only the deposit, so a public-API journal offers the action
    too, and its confirm deposits nothing. ⚠ [A1](#a1) the row action is
    offered before the review is complete, though nothing is deposited for an
    incomplete review. <sup>g</sup>
13. **Automatic author emails {OJS OMP}.** With the settings tab's email
    toggle on, recording the editorial decision Accept (or Skip Review) emails
    every contributor who does not yet hold a verified iD with a live
    permission (Rule 11) the verification request of Rule 8 ⚠ [A6](#a6). ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1) a preprint
    server shows the toggle but has no accepting decision to trigger it. <sup>k</sup>
14. **Which email goes out.** Under a public API the request email's subject
    line reads "Submission ORCID", which asks the contributor to connect
    their iD. Under a member API it reads "Requesting ORCID record access",
    which asks for deposit permission. The re-authorization mail of Rule 11
    is "Requesting updated ORCID record access" ⚠ [A21](#a21), whose text
    asks for "updateded permissions". All three carry the personal
    authorization link and the What-is-ORCID link, sent from the journal's
    principal contact. ⚠ [OPS2](#ops2) on a preprint server none of the three
    appears on the Emails settings screen. The re-authorization mail was once
    listed nowhere; it gained its journal and press rows upstream
    ([A7](#a7), resolved 2026-08-25). <sup>l</sup>
    14a. **What the request emails say.** Both request emails greet the
    contributor by name ("Dear {name},") and name the submission by its
    title in quotes. "Submission ORCID" reads "You have been listed as an
    author on a manuscript submission "{title}" to {journal name}.", and
    "Requesting ORCID record access" reads "…on the manuscript submission
    "{title}" to {journal name}." Both close with the journal's email
    signature, by default "This is an automated message from {journal
    name}." An email a journal has customized keeps the journal's wording
    through an upgrade: it still greets the contributor by name, closes
    with the journal's signature, and gains no title. <sup>l</sup>
15. Other screens that surface ORCID follow the rules above. The invitation
    wizard's "Verify ORCID iD" step (described in
    [User invitations](U06-user-invitations.md)) appears only while ORCID is
    enabled. The reviewer-suggestion form collects a plain, unverified
    "ORCID iD" text field. Reviewer lists distinguish a verified iD (solid
    icon) from an unauthenticated one (hollow icon, "(unauthenticated)"
    suffix); that is described with the Reviewers table in
    [Reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md). <sup>m</sup>
16. No app ships the old ORCID Profile plugin from the time before the
    built-in integration: Settings › Website › Plugins › "Installed
    Plugins" lists no ORCID row on a journal, press or preprint server
    ([OPS3](#ops3), retired). The built-in integration is what runs
    everywhere. <sup>q</sup>
17. **The French interface: the settings tabs.** ⚠ [A11](#a11) In French
    ("français" or "French" in "Change Language", the one installed), the
    journal's tab on Settings → Users & Roles and the site's side tab on
    Administration › Site Settings are named "Plugiciel de profil ORCID"
    ("ORCID Profile Plugin") instead of "ORCID". <sup>n</sup>

## Side effects

- **On "Request verification" / the Rule 13 decision**: one email to the
  contributor (Rule 14 chooses which), carrying their single-use
  authorization link. <sup>l</sup>
- **On completing an emailed authorization** on a member-API journal: an
  article already published is queued for deposit to the contributor's
  ORCID record in the background (a press queues nothing, [OMP1](#omp1)),
  and ⚠ [A22](#a22) the landing page says nothing about it. For an article
  not yet published the landing adds "The submission will be added to
  your ORCID record during publication." (on a press too). On a
  public-API journal the landing has no deposit line. <sup>f</sup>
- **On completing it for an article published without an issue** {OJS},
  on a member-API journal with DOIs on: ⚠ [OJS2](#ojs2) the landing is a
  blank page because the app fails. The iD is stored verified all the
  same, and the link opened again says "An ORCID iD was already stored
  for this submission." <sup>f</sup>
- **On publication**: work deposits to every eligible contributor (Rule 11)
  and, on a journal, review deposits for the article's completed reviews
  (Rule 12). They run in the background, with no notice on the publishing
  screen. Under the member API, with DOIs on (a new journal's default),
  publishing a journal article without an issue (on a journal with no
  issues, or with "Don't Assign To An Issue" ticked) fails with "An
  unexpected error has occurred. Please reload the page and try again."
  for a contributor with a verified iD: a reload shows the article
  published, and nothing reaches their ORCID record
  ⚠ [→ Publish, schedule & versions OJS4](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#ojs4).
  With DOIs off the same publish succeeds and the deposit goes out. <sup>j</sup>
- **On removing an iD** (own profile or a contributor's): a background
  request, which no screen shows, asks ORCID to cancel the iD's token,
  for a contributor's unauthenticated iD too [A20](#a20). <sup>d</sup>
- **ORCID request log**: under "Errors" (the default) the application
  log, a server file no screen shows, receives the feature's errors from
  screens and pages, such as a verification link matching no
  contributor. Under "All" it receives what those screens do (on
  publishing, the work about to be sent) and no errors [A16](#a16).
  Deposits and token cancellations, which run in the background, ignore
  the setting: they write only their failures to reach ORCID, as errors,
  at either level. <sup>a</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

- **Enable ORCID functionality** (per journal, or site-wide from Site
  Settings): the master switch; Rules 1–4.
- **Custom Redirect Base URL** (Site Settings, "ORCID" side tab; empty by
  default): with a value, every ORCID link returns the browser to an
  address starting with it instead of the site's own (Rule 2a).
- **ORCID API**: Public collects verified iDs only; Member also deposits
  (Rules 11–12). The two Sandbox variants aim every link and deposit at
  ORCID's test service instead of the real one.
- **Send e-mail to request ORCID authorization…**: the Rule 13 automatic
  emails; off by default.
- **City** plus the journal's country (from the journal's masthead settings):
  both required for review deposits (Rule 12).
- **ORCID request log**: logging verbosity only; no user-facing change.

## Cross-feature interactions

- **Profile — Identity tab** hosts the connect, authorize and delete controls
  (Rules 5–6). The tab itself and its other fields belong to the *User
  profile* feature.
- **Contributors list** (workflow and submission wizard) hosts the
  contributor ORCID field (Rule 8). The list's own mechanics belong to
  *Contributors & affiliations*.
- **Reviewers table** hosts "Send Review To ORCID" on a journal (Rule 12);
  a press's Reviewers table carries the same entry [A1](#a1). The
  table, its other row actions and its confirm-dialog chrome belong to
  [Reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md).
- **User invitations**: the accept wizard's "Verify ORCID iD" step and the
  send wizard's ORCID note are described in
  [User invitations](U06-user-invitations.md). They obey this spec's
  enablement rules.
- **Emails management**: the stored ORCID email templates are edited on the
  Emails settings screen (feature spec to come: *Emails management*). This
  spec owns the ORCID-specific gaps ⚠ [OPS2](#ops2) ⚠ [A7](#a7).
- **Publishing**: publishing, or scheduling a journal article into a
  future issue, is the deposit trigger (Rule 11). A
  contributor's unauthenticated iD, or the same iD on two contributors,
  does not stop the publication: the final publish window lists
  "Unauthenticated ORCiDs for contributors detected." or "Duplicate
  ORCiDs for contributors detected." among its warnings and still offers
  its button. The window and the publish action itself belong to
  [Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)
  (Rule 4). <sup>j</sup>
- **Site settings**: the site-wide "ORCID" tab is one of the Site Settings
  side tabs, on a site hosting one journal too (what else that page
  shows there: [Site settings](U60-site-settings.md), Rule 2). Its
  "Save", and a change left unsaved, follow that page's rules (its
  Rule 4).

## Canonical scenarios

Every scenario runs on a scratch journal with throwaway accounts, ORCID
enabled with sandbox credentials (scenario 1's journal starts with it off,
scenario 7's has it disabled); no step completes ORCID's own sign-in, and
the iDs a scenario starts from are seeded. Scenarios 4, 7 and 8 run on two
scratch journals each (4's second on the Member Sandbox API, 7's with ORCID
enabled, 8's with the email toggle off), scenarios 4, 8 and 11 read the
mail catcher, and scenario 10 signs in as the Author. The tooling recipe is in
the footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **Turn ORCID on for a journal**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with ORCID not
   yet enabled. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The "ORCID" tab, credentials empty**: open Settings → Users & Roles,
     tab "ORCID". Tick "Enable ORCID functionality"; the API fields appear.
     Press "Save" with "Client ID" and "Client Secret" both empty: both must
     be filled in, so the save is refused and nothing is saved. The
     profile's Identity tab, in another browser tab, still shows no ORCID
     field at all (Rules 1, 4).
   - **The "ORCID" tab, credentials filled**: pick "Public Sandbox" and
     enter a placeholder Client ID, APP-TEST, and a placeholder Client
     Secret, test-secret. The save does not check them against ORCID. Save.
   - **The profile's Identity tab, in another browser tab**: an ORCID block
     with a "Create or Connect your ORCID iD" button has appeared.
   - **A City left unsaved**: back on the "ORCID" tab, type Vancouver in
     "City" and do not save. Open the "Roles" tab of Users & Roles and come
     back to "ORCID": "City" still reads Vancouver. Leave Users & Roles for
     Settings › Journal: no question is asked. Open the "ORCID" tab again:
     "City" is empty (Rule 1).
   - **Settings › Website › Plugins**: open it, tab "Installed Plugins":
     the list has no ORCID row. No app ships the old ORCID Profile plugin;
     the ORCID just switched on is the built-in integration (Rule 16).
   - **Control**: untick "Enable ORCID functionality" and save again: the
     ORCID block is gone, and the Identity tab shows no ORCID field at all.

2. **The connect offer, and the About link that doesn't go there**

   Given: any signed-in user whose account holds no iD, on the profile's
   Identity tab of a scratch journal with ORCID enabled. <sup>s</sup>

   - **"Create or Connect your ORCID iD"**: press it. A small popup window
     opens on an ORCID sign-in address while the profile tab stays put.
     Close it.
   - **The "What is ORCID?" link beside the button**: press it: ⚠ [A4](#a4)
     the same popup opens instead of the What-is-ORCID page.
   - **Control**: the popup is a window of its own: the profile tab under it
     stays where it was, on the Identity tab's own address, and only the
     popup shows the ORCID sign-in address.

3. **Remove a connected iD from the profile**

   Given: a user whose account holds a verified iD (seeded), signed in, on
   the profile's Identity tab of a scratch journal with ORCID enabled; a
   second user of the same journal whose account holds an unauthenticated
   iD (seeded), in a browser of their own, signed in. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The Identity tab, verified iD**: shows the iD as a link with the solid
     ORCID icon and a "Delete" button; the connect button and the "What is
     ORCID?" link beside it are gone (Rule 5).
   - **The second user's Identity tab, unauthenticated iD**: shows the iD as
     a hollow-icon link suffixed "(unauthenticated)" and an "Authorize and
     Connect your ORCID iD" button with the "What is ORCID?" link beside it
     (Rules 5, 6a); ⚠ [A13](#a13) no "Delete" is offered.
   - **"Delete"**: on the first user's tab, press Delete. A window titled
     "Confirm" asks "Are you sure you want to remove this ORCID?", with
     "OK" and "Cancel"; press "OK". The iD is gone (Rule 6c).
   - **Control**: the "Create or Connect your ORCID iD" button is back.

4. **Ask a contributor to verify**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with a
   submission whose contributor has no iD; a second scratch journal on the
   Member Sandbox API with the same, its Journal Manager signed in as well;
   each journal with a principal contact of its own. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The contributor's ORCID iD field**: on the submission's Contributors
     list, edit a contributor who has no iD. The ORCID iD field shows
     "Request verification". Press it. The dialog asks "Would you like to
     send an email to this author requesting they verify their ORCID?";
     confirm. A saved contributor's email leaves at once; one still being
     added waits for the save (Rule 8).
   - **The field after the request**: on the open form, the field reads
     "ORCID Verification has been requested!", with a "Resend Verification
     Email" link beside it. Save, reopen the contributor: it reads the same
     (Rule 8).
   - **The contributor's mailbox**: holds the request email, subject line
     "Submission ORCID" on this public-API journal (Rule 14), with a
     personal authorization link (leading to ORCID's site) and the
     What-is-ORCID link, sent from the journal's principal contact (Rule 14).
     It opens "Dear {name}," with the contributor's name, reads "You have
     been listed as an author on a manuscript submission "{title}" to
     {journal name}." with the submission's title in quotes, and closes
     with the journal's email signature, by default "This is an automated
     message from {journal name}." (Rule 14a).
   - **"Resend Verification Email"**: with the first request email in the
     mailbox [A24](#a24), on the reopened contributor, press
     "Resend Verification Email". The dialog asks the same question, "Would
     you like to send an email to this author requesting they verify their
     ORCID?"; confirm. The contributor's mailbox now holds a second
     "Submission ORCID" request email (Rule 8).
   - **The member-API journal**: on the second journal, request verification
     for its contributor the same way: that contributor's mailbox holds the
     subject line "Requesting ORCID record access" instead, with the same
     two links, sent from that journal's principal contact (Rule 14). It
     greets the contributor by name the same way, reads "…on the
     manuscript submission "{title}" to {journal name}." with the
     submission's title in quotes, and closes with the same signature
     (Rule 14a).
   - **The What-is-ORCID link in each email**: open it: each journal's "What
     is ORCID?" page renders; only the member-API one's "How and why"
     carries the deposit sentence (Rule 10).
   - **A contributor being added**: back on the first journal's Contributors
     list, add a contributor: Given Name Nova, Email a throwaway address of
     its own (the footnote names it), Country Canada. On the new form press
     "Request verification": the dialog now adds "The email will be sent
     once the author has been created."; confirm. The new address's mailbox
     holds nothing: the request is remembered and waits for the save
     (Rule 8).
   - **Control**: save the new contributor: the address's mailbox now holds
     the request email, the positive control for the empty read above
     (Rule 8).

5. **Remove a contributor's iD**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with a
   submission whose contributor's iD is unauthenticated (seeded). <sup>s</sup>

   - **The contributor's ORCID iD field**: edit the contributor. The field
     shows the hollow-icon iD link, the not-verified warning, and "Delete".
   - **"Delete"**: press Delete and confirm: the iD is gone.
   - **Control**: the field offers "Request verification" again.

6. **The public ORCID pages by URL**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal with ORCID enabled.
   <sup>s</sup>

   - **The "What is ORCID?" page**: type the journal's `/orcid/about`
     address. The "What is ORCID?" page renders inside the journal's own
     header and footer.
   - **The "ORCID Authorization" page**: type `/orcid/verify`. The "ORCID
     Authorization" page answers "Your ORCID iD could not be verified. The
     link is no longer valid." and "Please contact the journal manager with
     your name, ORCID iD, and details of your submission." ⚠ [A8](#a8). A
     stale or truncated verification link gets this explanation, never an
     error page.
   - **Control**: `/orcid/about`, typed the same way while signed out,
     rendered its page, so the "no longer valid" answer is `/orcid/verify`'s
     own, an explanation and never an error page.

7. **A journal with ORCID off shows none of it**

   Given: a visitor and a Journal Manager on a scratch journal with ORCID
   disabled; a second scratch journal with ORCID enabled. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The registration page**: has no ORCID block.
   - **A contributor form**: has no ORCID iD field.
   - **The profile's Identity tab**: shows no ORCID field at all.
   - **The site-level Register page**: the site's own Register page, reached
     from the site homepage that lists the journals, shows no ORCID block
     either, while the enabled journal's Register page offers "Create or
     Connect your ORCID iD" at the top of its form (Actors row 3).
   - **Registering without connecting**: on the enabled journal's Register
     page, fill in the form with a throwaway username and email (the
     footnote names them; the form's own fields belong to *Registration &
     account validation*) and press "Register" without pressing "Create or
     Connect your ORCID iD": the registration completes as any registration
     does; connecting is never required to register (Rule 7).
   - **Control**: the same screens on the enabled journal show the Rule 5
     and Rule 8 controls: "Create or Connect your ORCID iD" on the Identity
     tab and at the top of the registration form, "Request verification" on
     the contributor's ORCID iD field.

App-specific:

8. **Accepting a submission asks the authors** {OJS OMP}

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with the ORCID
   email toggle on and two submissions in review, the second submitted by a
   contributor whose iD is verified (seeded); a second scratch journal with
   the toggle off and a submission in review. <sup>s</sup>

   - **Accept with the toggle on**: record Accept on the first submission in
     review. Each contributor without a verified iD receives the Rule 14
     request email, subject line "Submission ORCID" on this public-API
     journal (observe the mailbox).
   - **A contributor already verified**: record Accept on the second
     submission: nothing arrives for its verified contributor's address
     (Rule 13); the first submission's email is the positive control.
   - **Control**: with the toggle off, accepting the second journal's
     submission sends nothing: its contributor's mailbox holds no request
     email. On a preprint server this scenario does not
     run: its ORCID tab shows the same toggle, but the server has no
     accepting decision to trigger it [OPS1](#ops1).

9. **Send a review to ORCID** {OJS}

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal configured with
   the Member Sandbox API, with a submission in review whose reviewer holds
   a verified iD (seeded) and whose second reviewer holds no iD. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The Reviewers table, before the review is complete**: the API type
     gates only the background deposit, never the row action's presence
     (Rule 12). Open the row menu of the reviewer with the verified iD:
     "Send Review To ORCID" is offered ⚠ [A1](#a1) even before the review is
     complete.
   - **After the review is complete** (that reviewer has submitted their
     review): press "Send Review To ORCID". The dialog asks "Send this
     review to the reviewer's ORCID?"; confirm. The dialog closes with no
     message of any kind. The deposit itself happens in the background
     (Rule 12).
   - **Control**: the second reviewer's row menu, their account holding no
     iD, offers no "Send Review To ORCID": the row action's presence depends
     on the reviewer's verified iD alone (Rule 12).

10. **Where the Author can request verification** {OJS OMP OPS}

    Given: an Author, signed in, on a scratch journal with ORCID enabled,
    with a submitted submission of their own and a second one of their own
    not yet submitted; the journal's Journal Manager, in a browser of their
    own, signed in. <sup>s</sup>

    - **The submitted submission's Contributors list**: open the submission
      from the author's dashboard. On a journal or press its Contributors
      list is read-only; no contributor can be opened for editing, so no
      ORCID iD field and no "Request verification" is reached (Actors
      row 5). On a preprint server the same list offers "Order", "Preview"
      and "Add Contributor", and the author's own row "Edit" and "Delete"
      (the preprint baseline: [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md#ops1)):
      press "Edit"; the ORCID iD field offers "Request verification". Close
      the form without pressing it.
    - **The wizard's Contributors step**: open the unsubmitted submission
      from the dashboard; the submission wizard opens. Go on to its
      Contributors step and open the Author's own contributor for editing
      (the step's own controls belong to *Contributors & affiliations*): the
      ORCID iD field shows "Request verification". Press it. The dialog asks
      "Would you like to send an email to this author requesting they verify
      their ORCID?"; confirm: the field reads "ORCID Verification has been
      requested!" (Rule 8; Actors row 5).
    - **Control**: the Journal Manager opens the submitted submission's
      Contributors list and edits the same contributor: the ORCID iD field
      offers "Request verification" (Rule 8).

11. **A contributor verified under the public API is asked to re-authorize** {OJS OPS}

    Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal on the
    "Public Sandbox" API with a principal contact of its own and two
    submissions not yet published, each by its own contributor holding
    an iD verified while the journal was on that API (seeded); on a
    journal, also an issue to publish into. <sup>s</sup>

    - **The "ORCID" tab**: open Settings → Users & Roles, tab "ORCID".
      Pick "Member Sandbox" under "ORCID API" and save: the journal now
      adds published articles to its contributors' ORCID records (Rule 11).
    - **Publishing**: publish the first submission, on a journal into its
      issue, on a preprint server by posting it (the publish steps belong
      to [Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)).
    - **The first contributor's mailbox**: holds "Requesting updated ORCID
      record access", the request to re-authorize with the wider
      permission, since an iD verified under the public API holds no
      deposit permission (Rules 11, 14). It carries the personal
      authorization link and the What-is-ORCID link, and is sent from the
      journal's principal contact (Rule 14).
    - **Control**: the second submission, not published, has sent
      nothing: its contributor's mailbox holds no request email, since
      nothing is deposited before an article is published (Rule 11). The
      first contributor's email is the positive control.

    A press deposits nothing [OMP1](#omp1), so this scenario does not run
    on a press.

### Through the API

The checks below send what no screen sends; who may call the ORCID
routes is the grids' (*[Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md#api-grid-edit-gate)*
for "Request verification", [sending a review](#api-grid-send-review)),
checked apart (`docs/process/api.md`). "Delete" asks ORCID to cancel the
contributor's token (Rule 8a), so a check sends it only where it is
refused first.

API1. **With ORCID off, the contributor actions are refused** {OJS OMP OPS}

   Given: a Journal Manager, a submission with a contributor, ORCID off
   (a new journal's state, Rule 1).

   - **Off**: "Request verification" and "Delete" for that contributor
     through the API: each refused (403), and the contributor is not
     marked as asked. The contributor form shows neither while ORCID is
     off (Rule 4).
   - **Control**: with ORCID switched on, the same request is taken and
     the contributor reads as asked.

API2. **An author number that names no contributor is not found** {OJS OMP OPS}

   Given: a Journal Manager, ORCID on, a submission with a contributor.

   - **No such contributor**: "Request verification" and "Delete" for a
     number no contributor has: each answered "not found" (404), and the
     real contributor is not marked as asked. The form only sends its own
     contributor's number.

## Coverage

Left out of the scenarios above, by reason:

- **Planned**:
  - the guard for A4 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A4-what-is-orcid-link-opens-sign-in.md`): once fixed, Scenario 2 presses "What is ORCID?" on the profile Identity tab and the registration page and expects the "What is ORCID?" page (scenario 2's "What is ORCID?" bullet, which no suite asserts while A4 stands).
  - the guard for A2 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A2-orcid-denied-page-raw-placeholder.md`): once fixed, a contributor who denies access at ORCID lands on the "ORCID Authorization" page and reads "You denied access to your ORCID record.", no raw key.
  - the guard for A11 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A11-orcid-tabs-named-after-old-plugin.md`): once fixed, in French (Canada), both ORCID tabs (the site's and the journal's) read "ORCID".
  - the guard for A5's refusal (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A5-assistant-orcid-controls-refused.md`): once fixed, an Assistant whose assignment has the "Permissions" box presses "Request verification" (the email arrives) and "Delete" (the iD is gone), and one without the box is offered no "Edit".
  - the guard for A14 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A14-orcid-reauthorization-link-blank-page.md`): once fixed, a contributor verified under the public API follows "Requesting updated ORCID record access" after the journal moved to the member API and lands on the "ORCID Authorization" page, not a blank page.
  - the guard for A15 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A15-orcid-pages-tab-no-page-name.md`): once fixed, the "What is ORCID?" and "ORCID Authorization" pages' browser tab reads "What is ORCID? | {journal name}" and "ORCID Authorization | {journal name}".
  - the guard for A17 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A17-orcid-locked-tab-save-switches-journal-on.md`): once fixed, a Journal Manager saves "City" on the journal's locked ORCID tab while the site-wide switch is on, the Site Administrator turns the switch off, and the journal's "Enable ORCID functionality" reads unticked (Rule 3).
  - the guard for A22 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A22-orcid-landing-silent-on-deposit.md`): once fixed, a contributor of a published article on a member-API journal or preprint server completes the emailed authorization and the "ORCID Authorization" page adds "The submission has been added to your ORCID record." (Side effects).
  - the guard for A18 (issue report `docs/issues/U04-A18-orcid-popup-blank-when-orcid-unreachable.md`): once fixed, a sign-in popup coming back while the journal's server cannot reach ORCID closes with a message opening "ORCID authorization failed:", on the profile's Identity tab as Rule 6d's notice and on the registration page as an alert in the popup, the form keeping what was typed; on the registration page a refusal of the journal's credentials ends the same way (Rules 5, 6d, 7).
  - the guard for A1's early offer, once fixed: the row menu of a reviewer with a verified iD offers no "Send Review To ORCID" before the review is complete (Rule 12; scenario 9's first bullet, which the OJS suite does not assert while A1 stands).
  - once OPS1 is settled: scenario 8's preprint-server sentence, the server's ORCID tab showing the same toggle (Rule 13; the OPS suite leaves it out while OPS1 is open).
- **Nothing new to test**:
  - a Site Administrator on the journal's ORCID tab (Actors row 1; scenario 1's Journal Manager sees the same tab)
  - a Site Administrator or an assigned Section Editor requesting verification (Actors row 5; scenario 4's button)
  - a contributor's verified iD also offering "Delete" (Rule 8a; scenario 5's unauthenticated one)
  - a public-API journal offering "Send Review To ORCID" too (Rule 12; scenario 9's row action, the API type gating only the deposit)
  - Skip Review also triggering the emails (Rule 13; scenario 8's Accept)
  - each "ORCID API" choice aiming the sign-in popup at ORCID's real or test service (Fields "ORCID API"; Settings): a variant no scenario takes; scenario 2 opens the popup on the "Public Sandbox" choice
- **Register carries it**:
  - A5 (an Assistant offered "Request verification" and "Delete", refused yet reported sent; Actors rows 5–6)
  - A1 (a press's Site Administrator, Press Manager and Series Editor offered "Send Review To ORCID"; Actors row 8)
  - A4 ("What is ORCID?" beside the button opening the popup; Rule 6a; scenario 2 marks it)
  - A3 (the registration sign-in filling the form, the iD landing unauthenticated; Rule 7)
  - A2 (the landing after Deny showing a raw placeholder; Rule 9)
  - A8 (the failure line saying "journal manager" on presses and preprint servers; Rule 9; scenario 6 marks it)
  - A1 (the action offered before the review is complete; Rule 12; scenario 9 marks it)
  - A6 (the toggle's label misdescribing when it fires; Rule 13)
  - OPS2 (the preprint server's Emails screen lacking the three ORCID rows; Rule 14)
  - A11 (the French interface: both ORCID tabs named after the old plugin; Rule 17)
  - A23 (an edit of a published item re-sending the work to the contributors' records; Rule 11)
  - A13 (no "Delete" for the owner's unauthenticated iD on the Identity tab; Actors row 4, Rule 6c; scenario 3 marks it)
  - A14 (the re-authorization email's link failing with a server error; Rule 11)
  - A15 (the public ORCID pages' browser tab showing no page name; Rule 10)
  - A16 (the "All" log level writing informational entries in place of errors; Fields, Side effects)
  - A17 ("Save" on the locked tab switching the journal's own ORCID on; Rule 3)
  - A18 (the popup left blank when the journal's server cannot reach ORCID or ORCID fails, and on the registration page when ORCID refuses the journal's credentials; Rules 5, 7)
  - A19 ("Delete" on the Identity tab discarding unsaved changes; Rule 6c)
  - A20 (a contributor's unauthenticated iD deleted with a token cancellation sent to ORCID; Rule 8a)
  - A21 ("updateded permissions" in the re-authorization email; Rule 14)
  - A22 (the landing for a published article saying nothing of the deposit; Side effects)
  - A24 ("Resend Verification Email" pressed while the first request email still waits to go out sending nothing; Rule 8)
  - OJS1 (a review deposit failing in the background on a journal with no country; Rule 12)
  - OJS2 (the blank page after verifying for an article published without an issue; Side effects)
- **No seed**:
  - the Site Administrator enabling ORCID site-wide (Actors row 2, Rule 2): Site Settings → ORCID is one setting shared by every test running at once, so it stays off
  - the journal tab's switch, API type and credentials locked under the site-wide configuration, and its own values back once the box is unticked (Rule 3): the same site-wide setting
  - a "Custom Redirect Base URL" saved, refused or emptied, and the ORCID links starting with it (Fields; Rule 2a): the same site-wide setting
  - the "ORCID" side tab on an install hosting one journal (Rule 2): the test installs always host several journals
  - the sign-in completion storing the verified iD and reloading the tab (Rule 5): ORCID's own sign-in cannot complete on the test installs, so verified iDs are seeded instead
  - a sign-in ORCID refuses for wrong credentials closing the popup with the "ORCID authorization failed:" notice (Rule 6d): the same sign-in
  - the emailed link completing verification, signed out (Actors row 7, Rule 9): the same sign-in
  - the emailed link being single-use, a used link answering "An ORCID iD was already stored for this submission." (Actors row 7, Rule 9): the same sign-in
  - any other link for a contributor whose iD is already verified answering "An ORCID iD was already stored for this submission." (Rule 9): the same sign-in, since only a contributor without a verified iD is offered "Request verification" or sent the Accept email (Fields, contributor's ORCID iD field; Rule 13)
  - a contributor who denies access at ORCID from the emailed link keeping an iD they already held, still unauthenticated on their ORCID iD field (Rule 6b): the same sign-in, the denial being pressed on ORCID's consent screen
  - the success landing returning to the front page after ten seconds (Rule 9): the same sign-in
  - the landing after an emailed authorization on a member-API journal adding "The submission will be added to your ORCID record during publication." for an article not yet published, and no deposit line on a public-API journal (Side effects): the same sign-in
  - publishing on the member API, or scheduling a journal article into a future issue, sending a work to each contributor with a verified iD and a live permission, and none for the others (Rule 11): the deposit shows only in the background job queue, which the screens do not show, and its arrival needs a stand-in for ORCID's service that the suites lack
  - works updated in place on later publishes (Rule 11): the same deposit. The app does remember a deposited work (the identifier ORCID's first answer gives it is stored with the contributor, and the next deposit updates that work); what the suites lack is the stand-in for ORCID's work service
  - presses sending no works on publication, OMP1 (Rule 11): the same job queue
  - publishing sending the article's completed reviews (Rule 12): the same job queue
  - a review deposit skipped without a City (Settings; Rule 12): the same job queue
  - removing an iD sending ORCID a token cancellation (Side effects): the same job queue
  - the ORCID request log under "Errors" writing the feature's errors, and the background's failures to reach ORCID at either level (Side effects): the application log is not a screen, and the suites do not read it
  - a verified contributor whose permission has lapsed being asked again on Accept (Rule 13): the scenario API seeds only a live permission
  - a customized request email keeping the journal's wording through an upgrade (Rule 14a): the test installs are never upgraded
- **Owned by another feature**:
  - the invitation wizard's "Verify ORCID iD" step, present only while ORCID is enabled (Rule 15; *User invitations*)
  - the reviewer-suggestion form's plain "ORCID iD" field (Rule 15; *Reviewer suggestions*)
  - the reviewer lists' verified and unauthenticated icons (Rule 15; *Reviewer assignment & management*)
  - publishing without an issue failing for a contributor with a verified iD (Side effects; *Publish, schedule & versions*, its register entry OJS4)
  - an unauthenticated or duplicate iD listed as a warning in the final publish window, the publication still published (Cross-feature interactions; *Publish, schedule & versions*, Rule 4)
  - the "ORCID" side tab listed among the Site Settings side tabs of a site hosting several journals (Rule 2; *Site settings*, scenario 1)
  - the site tab's "Save" and a change left unsaved (Cross-feature interactions; *Site settings*, Rule 4)

**A1 — Send Review To ORCID ignores review completion, and answers with silence** · 🐞 · medium.
The Reviewers table offers "Send Review To ORCID" on any row whose reviewer
holds a verified iD, whatever the state of the review: the completion
condition the action was given never evaluates to false. Confirming it
then answers with silence. An editor who presses it on a completed
review and answers "OK" sees the question close and nothing else, though
in several setups nothing is sent: a press sends no reviews to ORCID by
design, and a journal sends nothing when its ORCID settings use the
public API or lack a City, or the journal has no country. Only a journal
on the member API with both set queues the review, or first emails the
reviewer a request for permission, also without a word to the editor
(Rule 12).

A contributor who follows the emailed ORCID verification link and
presses "Deny" on ORCID's consent screen comes back to the "ORCID
Authorization" page. Where it should explain that they refused access,
the page shows the raw code `##orcid.authDenied##`. The refusal itself
is recorded correctly; only the explanation is missing, and the fix is
to render the sentence the translations already hold. The setup is any
journal, press or preprint server with ORCID turned on. The verification
email goes out when an editor presses "Request verification" on a
contributor, or when a submission is accepted with the ORCID setting
"Send e-mail to request ORCID authorization from authors when an article
is accepted" ticked.

**A3 — Registration-connected iD arrives unverified** · ❓ · minor.
A visitor who connects their ORCID iD while registering, by signing in at
ORCID from the registration page's popup, gets an account that holds the iD
as **unauthenticated**. The profile then shows the hollow icon, the
"(unauthenticated)" suffix and an "Authorize and Connect your ORCID iD"
button asking them to do it again. The sign-in they already completed
granted this install a token that is simply not kept.
Question: should the registration connect count as verification?
Lean: yes. Asking the same person to authorize twice reads as a gap, not a
choice.

On a journal, press or preprint server with ORCID turned on, a user who
presses "What is ORCID?" beside the "Create or Connect your ORCID iD"
button gets ORCID's sign-in window, the same as the button, instead of
the site's "What is ORCID?" page. This happens on the profile's Identity
tab and at the top of the registration form. The window opens over the
page: the profile, or the registration form with whatever the visitor
has typed, stays as it was behind it, and the user can close the window
and carry on. Nothing typed is lost.

**A5 — Assistant's refused ORCID controls report success** · 🐞 · low.
When an editor lets an Assistant change the publication, the Assistant
can edit a contributor, and the contributor's "ORCID iD" field offers
them "Request verification" and "Delete". The server refuses both: a
window titled "Error" says "You are not authorized to access the
requested resource.", no email goes out, and the iD stays. The ORCID
routes leave the Assistant out, though Assistants may edit every other
contributor field. The field behind the window still reports success:
it switches to "ORCID Verification has been requested!" or shows the
iD gone, until the form is closed and opened again.

**A8 — A press's or preprint server's ORCID verification failure page says to contact "the journal manager"** · 🐞 · low.
When a contributor's ORCID verification fails on a press or a preprint
server (a used or stale link, a refusal at ORCID, an iD already stored),
the "ORCID Authorization" page closes with "Please contact the journal
manager with your name, ORCID iD, and details of your submission." A
press has a press manager and a preprint server a preprint server
manager; there is no journal. The fix is one English sentence. Ten other

A site administrator or manager working in French (Canada), German,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil), Russian or one of 25
other languages finds the two ORCID settings tabs named after the ORCID
Profile plugin, as if the settings belonged to a plugin, though the
built-in ORCID feature replaced it in 3.5. The tabs are the site's,
under Administration › Site Settings, and each journal's, press's or
preprint server's, under Settings › Users & Roles. French (Canada) reads
"Plugiciel de profil ORCID", German "ORCID-Plugin", Spanish "Módulo de
perfil ORCID"; English and French (France) read "ORCID". Evidence lists
every language.
The English text changed to "ORCID" when the feature was built in, but
the translations were not marked for review. The fix is a developer's,
not the translators': setting "ORCID" in each affected language's file
in pkp-lib, one pull request on each of `stable-3_5_0` and `main`.

On the profile's Identity tab a verified iD has a "Delete" button, but an
unauthenticated one has none (Rules 5, 6c). A user whose account holds an
iD they never verified, one imported or one connected while registering
([A3](#a3)), cannot remove it themselves: the tab's only button for it,
"Authorize and Connect your ORCID iD", opens ORCID's sign-in. The
contributor's ORCID iD field differs: it offers "Delete" for an
unauthenticated iD and its note asks for that iD to be removed (Fields &
validation).
Question: should the owner of an unauthenticated iD be able to remove it
from their profile?

contributor field already allows the same removal.

**A14 — A contributor following the "Requesting updated ORCID record access" link gets a blank page and can never allow deposits** · 🐞 · medium · crash: server.
A journal that moves from ORCID's public API to its member API needs
wider permission from contributors who verified their iD before the
move. When such a contributor's article is published, the journal emails
them "Requesting updated ORCID record access", with a link to ORCID's
sign-in. When ORCID sends them back to the journal, the app fails on the
server and the browser shows a blank page, whether they pressed
"Authorize" or "Deny". Nothing is stored, so the article never reaches
their ORCID record, and every later click fails the same way. The fix

ORCID pages do not, signed in or out. On the "What is ORCID?" page and
the "ORCID Authorization" page the tab reads "| Journal of Public
Knowledge" ("| Public Knowledge Press" on a press, "| Public Knowledge
Preprint Server" on a preprint server), though each page's heading shows
its name. Contributors reach these pages through ORCID. Every ORCID
email links to "What is ORCID?". ORCID sends the contributor back to
"ORCID Authorization" after they answer an authorization request. Both
pages open by their address on every install, whether or not ORCID is
turned on, but nothing links to them until it is. The fix is one
attribute in each of the two page templates, the way the other public

Journal Manager who presses "Save" on that tab, to change one of the
fields it leaves editable ("City", the email option or the log level),
also stores the locked box as the journal's own setting, ticked. When
the site-wide switch is turned off again, a journal that had ORCID off
keeps it on, with no Client ID. Its Identity tab and Register page offer
"Create or Connect your ORCID iD", and "Request verification" on a
contributor emails the author an ORCID link. Both open ORCID's sign-in

A user who signs in at ORCID from the profile's "Create or Connect your
ORCID iD" (or "Authorize and Connect your ORCID iD"), or from a
journal's registration page, is sent back to the journal in the popup.
If at that moment ORCID's service cannot be reached, or answers with a
failure of its own, the app fails on the server: the popup stays open on
a blank page, and the profile or the registration form under it says
nothing. Nothing is stored. When ORCID refuses the journal's credentials
instead, the popup closes and the profile shows "ORCID authorization
failed:"; the user expected the same kind of answer here. The
registration page does not get that refusal notice either. When ORCID
refuses the journal's credentials there, the popup's own script fails in
the browser, and the popup stays blank just the same. It happens only on
a journal, press or server that has ORCID switched on. On an install

your contribution to your ORCID profile." A corrected text in a new
release reaches new installs only: each journal already running keeps
its stored copy of the email until its manager corrects the word in the

list the email there, so it cannot. The email is sent to contributors

The verification request email goes out from the install's background

request, so the first email has left before anyone can press again. On
an install that works the queue on a schedule instead, as PKP advises
for busy sites, an editor who presses "Resend Verification Email" before
the queue next runs gets the same question, confirms, and sees the field
still read "ORCID Verification has been requested!", but no second
email is sent: the contributor receives the first one alone when the
queue runs, and nothing tells the editor. A resend pressed after the
first email has left sends a second one. (Rule 8)
Question: should a resend pressed while the first email still waits
send a second email, or tell the editor the first is still on its way?
Lean: one email is enough, since the first still arrives with a working

a resend that does nothing.

An editor on a journal with no country presses "Send Review To ORCID" on
a completed review and answers "OK". The question closes with no
message, as it always does. The journal uses ORCID's member API and has
a City in its ORCID settings. The deposit then runs as a background job,
and the server fails it with a type error. Without a City the same job
ends quietly, and the design means a review to be skipped the same way
when the country is missing. The editor sees nothing different, but the
site administrator's Administration › "View Failed Jobs" gains an entry
for every review the journal tries to send, and its error does not say
that a country is missing. A journal upgraded from 3.3 has no country
until its "Masthead" is saved. Among those, one that sent reviews to
ORCID through the ORCID Profile plugin keeps the plugin's City through
the upgrade, which drops the plugin's Country, so its first review sent
afterwards fails this way. (Rule 12; the editor's silent "OK" is

**A9 — Site ORCID tab on a single-journal install** · ✅ · retired. The question is gone: the tab no longer depends on the number of journals (pkp/pkp-lib#13493, seen at the PR head before its merge), 2026-10-09. <sup>[f-a9](#fn-a9)</sup>

<a id="a10"></a>
**A10 — Deleting a contributor's iD fails outright** · ✅ · retired. Fixed upstream (pkp-lib `ecd12271ed` + `d9e9b3fc7c`, pkp/pkp-lib#13003 follow-ups), 2026-09-03. <sup>[f-a10](#fn-a10)</sup>

<a id="a12"></a>
**A12 — French: the contributor's ORCID iD field shows raw codes** · ✅ · retired. Overturned by Jarda, 2026-10-08: a missing translation is no finding (TEMPLATE "Findings register"). <sup>[f-a12](#fn-a12)</sup>

<a id="ops3"></a>
**OPS3 — Legacy ORCID Profile plugin ships alongside the built-in feature** · ✅ · retired. Gone: no app bundles the plugin any more (removed upstream, pkp/pkp-lib#9771), seen 2026-10-16 (Rule 16). <sup>[f-ops3](#fn-ops3)</sup>

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — Context form: `PKP\components\forms\context\OrcidSettingsForm`
(component `orcidSettings`), mounted as tab `orcidSettings` in
`templates/management/access.tpl` from `ManagementHandler::access()` — the tab
is unconditional (no enablement gate). Fields/constants:
`OrcidManager::ENABLED/API_TYPE/CLIENT_ID/CLIENT_SECRET/CITY/
SEND_MAIL_TO_AUTHORS_ON_PUBLICATION/LOG_LEVEL`; API options
`publicProduction/publicSandbox/memberProduction/memberSandbox`; API type,
Client ID and Client Secret are `isRequired` and shown only while the enable
box is ticked (`showWhen: orcidEnabled`). Tab label = locale
`orcid.displayName` ("ORCID"). Logging: `OrcidManager::logInfo()/logError()`
via Laravel `Log` to the application log `<files_dir>/logs/app-<date>.log`,
level from `LOG_LEVEL` (`ERROR` default / `INFO` = all); what each level writes: finding A16, note f-a16.
Screen reachability: Users & Roles gating is the user-management feature's
(`CanAccessSettingsPolicy`). Live-probed 2026-08-07 (OJS, OMP, OPS): tab,
fields, labels and required-field errors as described, identical in all
three apps. Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs
each; Rule 1): the box ticked and "Unsaved City" typed, another Users &
Roles tab and back kept both; leaving for Settings › Journal
(`management/settings/context`) raised no browser dialog, and nothing
was saved.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — Site form: `PKP\components\forms\site\OrcidSiteSettingsForm`
(component `orcidSiteSettings`), tab in `templates/admin/settings.tpl` gated
`componentAvailability['orcidSiteSettings']`, which
`AdminHandler::siteSettingsAvailability()` sets `true` whatever the
context count since pkp/pkp-lib#13493 (before it, the key followed
`$isMultiContextSite`, context count !== 1). Site fields: enable ("Enable
ORCID functionality site-wide"), `orcidCustomRedirectBaseUrl` ("Custom
Redirect Base URL", `site.json` validation `nullable|url`, added by the
same PR), API type, Client ID, Client Secret. Override behavior:
`OrcidManager::isGloballyConfigured()` (site `orcidEnabled`) short-circuits
`isEnabled()` to true for every context and makes `getClientId()/
getClientSecret()/getApiType()` read site values; the context form then
renders the enable option `disabled`, API/ID as read-only rows, the secret
as `*************************`, and appends
`orcid.manager.settings.description.globallyconfigured` ("…Contact your site
administrator to disable ORCID functionality or change these credentials.").
City/email-toggle/log-level have no site fields (`getCity()` etc. always read
the context). Live-probed 2026-08-07: the site tab carried exactly the four
fields it had then; enabling site-wide locks every journal's tab as described
("configured globally" text, masked secret); disabling it restores each
journal's own editable values. The single-journal case was not exercised
then, every test install hosting several journals; the 2026-10-09 drive
below settled it (A9, retired).
Live-probed 2026-09-28 (OJS, OMP, OPS; English and French; two runs
each; Rule 2, Fields "Site-wide ORCID settings"): the side tab
(`#orcidSiteSettings-button`) under "Site Setup", its box "Enable ORCID
functionality site-wide" with the description "ORCID functionality can
optionally be enabled and configured at a site level for all
journals/presses/servers. …"; ticked, the three required fields (API
default "Public"). "Save" ticked with both credentials empty is refused
on the page ("This field is required." under each, "Please correct 2
errors.", Save disabled) and sends no request; "Save" on the untouched,
unticked tab answers "Saved" and stores `orcidEnabled=0`, the box still
unticked after a reload. A tick left unsaved survives a trip to
"Information" and back, and is dropped without a question on leaving the
page (the Site settings spec's Rule 4). Site-level ORCID was never
switched on (`orcidEnabled=0` before and after).
Live-probed 2026-10-09 at the PR head `e29a720de0`, before its
merge (pkp/pkp-lib#13493, issue pkp/pkp-lib#13283; OJS, OMP and OPS the
same, on PKP's default test dataset, whose install hosts one journal;
Actors row 2; Fields "Site ORCID settings"; Rules 2, 2a and 3): Site
Settings showed
"Site Setup" alone, with the side tabs "Security", "Languages", "Bulk
Emails", "Statistics" and "ORCID"; once a second journal was created
the page showed every tab, "ORCID" still the last "Site Setup" side
tab. The tab read "Enable ORCID functionality site-wide" with its
description, then "Custom Redirect Base URL" with the description
quoted in Fields, then, the box ticked, "ORCID API" ("Public", "Public
Sandbox", "Member", "Member Sandbox"), "Client ID" and "Client Secret",
each "Required". On the one-journal install the box ticked and saved
(Public Sandbox, a placeholder pair) left the journal's tab with "Enable
ORCID functionality" checked and disabled, the note "The ORCID API was
configured globally by the host. The ORCID API, Client ID, and Client
Secret have been set at the site-level and cannot be changed here.
Contact your site administrator to disable ORCID functionality or change
these credentials.", "ORCID API" and "Client ID" as plain text and the
secret as `*************************`; unticked and saved, the
journal's tab was editable again with its own API type, Client ID and
secret. "Custom Redirect Base URL": "not a url" was refused (400, "This
is not a valid URL." under the field, "Please correct one error.") and
stored nothing; `https://example.com/` was saved with the box unticked
(`orcidEnabled` false) and still filled the field after a reload, the
journal's tab staying editable with no "configured globally" note. With
it stored, the `redirect_uri` of the sign-in address behind "Create or
Connect your ORCID iD" on the profile and on the registration page, and
behind the "Submission ORCID" email's link, read
`https://example.com/index.php/publicknowledge/orcid/authorizeOrcid?targetOp=profile`,
`…?targetOp=register` and
`https://example.com/index.php/publicknowledge/orcid/verify?token=…&state=…&author_id=…`,
where each began `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` with nothing stored; saved
empty, the stored row was gone and the three addresses began with the
site's own address again. Mechanism: `OrcidManager::buildOAuthUrl()`
replaces the scheme and host of the redirect address with
`getCustomRedirectUrl()` (the site's `orcidCustomRedirectBaseUrl`),
whatever `isGloballyConfigured()` says. Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS three
runs, OMP and OPS two each, on `main`; Actors row 1, Rule 3; the site
record put back after each window): with the site-wide box ticked and
saved (Public Sandbox, `APP-TEST`), a journal's tab showed the box
checked and disabled, "ORCID API Public Sandbox" and "Client ID
APP-TEST" as text, the secret as 25 asterisks and the note quoted
above, while "City", the email toggle, "ORCID request log" and "Save"
stayed live ("City" typed and saved: 200 "Saved"). Unticked and saved,
the journal that had its own pair got "Public Sandbox", "APP-JOURNALOWN"
and its secret back, editable. The journal's "Save" posts
`orcidEnabled=true` beside City, toggle and log level (finding A17).
At the PR heads of 2026-10-13 (pkp-lib `1836046394`, before their merge; OJS, OMP and OPS the same, on PKP's default test dataset), "https://example.com" saved without its closing slash gave the same addresses as "https://example.com/": `https://example.com/index.php/publicknowledge/orcid/authorizeOrcid?targetOp=profile` (`…targetOp=register` on the registration page, `…/orcid/verify?token=…` in the "Submission ORCID" email); at the first heads it had given `https://example.comindex.php/…` (Rule 2a).

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — Profile: `PKP\user\form\IdentityForm::fetch()` assigns
`orcidEnabled` only when `$request->getContext() && OrcidManager::isEnabled()`
(code comment: ORCID needs a context, so the site-level profile never shows
it); template `lib/pkp/templates/user/identityForm.tpl` guards the whole
block `{if $orcidEnabled}`. Live-probed 2026-08-07 (OJS, OMP, OPS): with
ORCID disabled the Identity tab renders NO ORCID field at all — the
template's fallback plain `orcid` text field does not surface on screen;
enabled, all three connect states render with the strings and icons of
Rule 5, and in the verified state the connect button and About link are
gone. Enabled: the included
`templates/form/orcidProfile.tpl` hides `input[name=orcid]` via JS
(`targetOp == 'profile'`) and injects: authorise variant (hollow icon link +
`orcid.authorise` button) when `$orcid && !$orcidAuthenticated`, connect
variant (`orcid.connect` button) otherwise, or the solid-icon `#orcid-link`
when `$orcidAuthenticated` (`User::hasVerifiedOrcid()` =
`orcidIsVerified`). `openORCID()` pings ORCID logout then
`window.open($orcidOAuthUrl)` — URL from `OrcidManager::buildOAuthUrl(
'authorizeOrcid', ['targetOp' => 'profile'])`; scope `/authenticate` (public)
or `/activities/update` (member). Popup completion:
`AuthorizeUserData::execute()` case `profile` stores
`setVerifiedOrcidOAuthData()` (iD, verified flag, token, scope, refresh,
expiry) and reloads the profile tab. The About link:
`<a href="{orcid/about}" onclick="return openORCID();">` — finding A4.
Refused credentials (Rule 6d): live-probed 2026-10-09 at the PR head
`e29a720de0`, before its merge (pkp/pkp-lib#13493, issue
pkp/pkp-lib#13283; OJS, OMP and OPS the same, on PKP's default test
dataset, the journal on Public
Sandbox with a placeholder pair; ORCID's token endpoint stood in
locally, since the test installs reach no outside service). The popup's
return address (`…/orcid/authorizeOrcid?targetOp=profile&code=…`), the
stand-in answering 401
`{"error":"invalid_client","error_description":"Client not found: APP-TEST"}`,
closed the popup, and the profile's notification area read "ORCID
authorization failed: Client not found: APP-TEST. Reason:
invalid_client."; the account held no `orcid` setting afterwards and
the Identity tab still showed "Create or Connect your ORCID iD". With
the stand-in answering a token, the popup closed with no notice and the
tab showed the iD as a link with "Delete" (Rule 5's completion).
ORCID's own sandbox answers a made-up client with 401
`{"error_description":"Client authentication failed","error":"invalid_client"}`.
Rule 6d names only a wrong Client Secret: the refusal driven is the
token request's, after the sign-in; a wrong Client ID, which ORCID's own
sign-in page may refuse before any sign-in, was not driven.
`AuthorizeUserData::execute()` catches the token request's
`ClientException`, composes the notice (`getAuthErrorDisplayMessage()`)
and, for `targetOp` `profile` and `invitation`, skips the token storage.
Live-probed 2026-10-16, a re-drive (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs each, the same
kind of stand-in; Rules 5, 6d): with a token answered, the popup closed
by itself with no notice and the reloaded tab showed `#orcid-link` with
the solid icon and "Delete", the account holding `orcidIsVerified=1`,
the token fields and scope `/authenticate`; with 401 `invalid_client`,
the notice "ORCID authorization failed: Client not found: APP-TEST.
Reason: invalid_client.", nothing stored, the connect button still
there. ORCID unreachable, or answering 500: finding A18 (note f-a18).

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — Delete own iD: `#deleteOrcidButton` (guard
`$orcid && $orcidAuthenticated`), confirm modal
`orcid.field.deleteOrcidModal.message`, submits with injected
`removeOrcidId=true`; `IdentityForm::execute()` then nulls
orcid/verified and calls `OrcidManager::removeOrcidAccessToken($user)` which
dispatches `PKP\jobs\orcid\RevokeOrcidToken` (JOB-018 — POST to ORCID's
`oauth/revoke`) and clears token fields. Live-probed 2026-08-07: confirming
the modal removes the iD at once — no separate form save. The modal is the
shared `linkAction/buttonConfirmationLinkAction.tpl`: title
`form.confirmSubmit.title` ("Confirm"), buttons `common.ok` / `common.cancel`;
`identityForm.tpl`, `orcidProfile.tpl` and the three locale strings are
identical in the three apps' lib/pkp, with no app override. Live-probed
2026-10-01 (OJS, two runs, a journal with ORCID on, two throwaway Readers
signed in on the Identity tab; kept walk
`shared/playwright/checks/U14/Ks01/ks01.js`, its `orcid` phase): the
verified Reader's "Delete" opened the window "Confirm" with the question,
"OK" and "Cancel"; the unauthenticated Reader's tab carried no "Delete"
button at all (finding A13). Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on
`main`, two runs each): "Cancel" left the iD; "OK" posted the identity
form's save (200) with no notice, the tab and a reload showing "Create
or Connect your ORCID iD", the account keeping only `orcidIsVerified=0`,
and one `RevokeOrcidToken` queued, which tried `…/oauth/revoke` once the
queue was drained. With an unsaved name change: finding A19.

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — Contributor field: `PKP\components\forms\FieldOrcid` added to
`ContributorForm` only when `OrcidManager::isEnabled()`; Vue
`FieldOrcid.vue` — states per its guards: request button
(`orcid.field.verification.request` / dialog
`orcid.field.authorEmailModal.title/.message`) posting
`orcid/requestAuthorVerification/{authorId}`; requested state
(`orcid.field.verification.requested`, `orcid.field.verification.resendRequest`);
deferred mode `currentValue='shouldRequestVerification'` when `authorId` is 0
— honored by `PKPSubmissionController::addContributor()`, which sends after
creating the author; unverified note `orcid.field.unverified.shouldRequest`;
delete button posting `orcid/deleteForAuthor/{authorId}` →
`OrcidController::deleteForAuthor()` (nulls iD, revokes token). API gate
(API-029): middleware roles Site Admin, Manager, Sub-editor, Author +
`hasEditPermissions()` (managers; assigned sub-editors; the submission's
authors) — `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT` absent → finding A5. Requests also set
`orcidVerificationRequested` (drives the requested state on reload).
Live-probed 2026-08-07 (OJS deep; OMP and OPS request round-trip): dialog,
requested state, resend link, both iD states and the delete confirmation as
described; the deferred-request dialog adds "The email will be sent once the
author has been created." and the mail goes out on save; an Author reaches
the button from the submission wizard's Contributors step (the dashboard
contributor list is read-only for them on OJS and OMP; test run 2026-09-13
on OPS: the submitting author's dashboard list on an unposted preprint
carried "Order", "Preview", "Add Contributor" and the row's "Edit" and
"Delete", and "Edit" opened the form with the ORCID iD field's "Request
verification", the *Contributors & affiliations* OPS1 baseline).
Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs each; Rules 8,
8a): "Resend Verification Email" opened the same "Request ORCID
verification" question, "Yes" posted `orcid/requestAuthorVerification`
again (200), and after the queue was drained the contributor's mailbox
held two "Submission ORCID". "Delete" beside either iD state ("Delete
ORCID" / "Are you sure you want to remove this ORCID?" / "Yes" "No")
posted `orcid/deleteForAuthor` (200), the field showing "Request
verification" at once and after a reload, and queued `RevokeOrcidToken`,
for the unauthenticated iD too (finding A20).

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — Pages: `PKP\pages\orcid\OrcidHandler` (ROUTE-021), ops
`verify/authorizeOrcid/about/updateScope`, site-access policy all roles
(login required only for `authorizeOrcid` with `targetOp` profile/submit);
`about` renders `frontend/pages/orcidAbout.tpl` (`orcid.about.title` "What
is ORCID?"; member/public branch `orcid.about.howAndWhyMemberAPI` vs
`…PublicAPI`); `verify` matches the author by emailed token
(`orcidEmailToken` + publication `state`) then
`VerifyIdentityWithOrcid` exchanges the OAuth code, stores
verified iD + token, and for a published article queues the deposit
(`depositOrcidItem()`; the landing's `orcid.verify.sendSubmissionToOrcid.success`
line never shows, finding A22); for an unpublished one under the member
API, `submissionNotPublished` adds "The submission will be added to your
ORCID record during publication.". Template
`frontend/pages/orcidVerify.tpl` branch keys: success `orcid.verify.success`
+ 10-second JS redirect (`orcid.verify.success.redirect`); failure
`orcid.verify.failure`, `orcid.verify.duplicateOrcid` (rendered
2026-10-16, note o), `orcid.invalidClient`,
`orcid.authFailure`, missing `orcid.authDenied` (finding A2); tail
`orcid.failure.contact`. `updateScope` serves the re-authorization
links (`OrcidDepositType` work or review) and, for a work, finds no
contributor: the emailed link carries no `state`, which
`getAuthorToVerify()` filters on, and the handler then passes the null
identity to `VerifyIdentityWithOrcid` before the code is read (finding
A14). Deny handling (Rule 6b): `OrcidHandler::handleUserDeniedAccess()`,
on the emailed link's return, stores `orcidAccessDenied` and nulls the
token fields and `orcidEmailToken`, never `orcid` (`orcidAccessDenied`
shows on no screen; with `orcidEmailToken` gone the link matches nobody,
the "no longer valid" answer of note o and f-a2); on the profile popup's
return `AuthorizeUserData::execute()` never reads ORCID's `error`
parameter and requests a token as for a code (`main` and `stable-3_5_0`).
Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs each, signed
out; the case with an iD on OJS and OMP, whose Accept sends the request
to a contributor already holding one): the email's return with
`error=access_denied` stored `orcidAccessDenied` and removed the email
token, an unauthenticated contributor's `orcid` unchanged with
`orcidIsVerified=0`; the profile popup's return with the same
parameters, for a verified account, sent the token request and left
every setting as before (the blank popup of finding A18). The landing
after a completed authorization, live-probed 2026-10-16 with a local
stand-in for ORCID's token answer (OJS, OMP, OPS, two runs each, signed
out; Side effects): under Member Sandbox a published article's landing
showed the success sentence and "You will now be automatically directed
back to {context name}." only, with `DepositOrcidSubmission` queued (OJS,
OPS; none on OMP); an unpublished one's added "The submission will be
added to your ORCID record during publication." (OMP too); under Public
Sandbox no deposit line. An article published without an issue: finding
OJS2. Config kill-switch: `[general] sandbox` makes
verify/authorizeOrcid/updateScope return blank (not set on the test
installs). Live-probed 2026-08-07: about and verify render by URL inside
the journal chrome with the stated headings and failure text (OJS; URL
control on OMP and OPS); a member-API journal switches the about page's
"How and why" section. Live-probed 2026-10-05 (Actors row 8; Rules 9–10;
scenario 6; OJS, OMP and OPS on `main`, two runs, signed out and as Site
Administrator, Journal Manager and Author): both pages answered 200 with
"What is ORCID?" and "ORCID Authorization" inside the context's header
and footer; `orcid/verify` typed bare, and the verification email's link
(`…/orcid/verify?token=…&state=…&author_id=…`, reached through
`sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize`) returned with a code ORCID did not
issue, both read "Your ORCID iD could not be verified. The link is no
longer valid." and the `orcid.failure.contact` line, the same words on
OMP and OPS; `orcid/updateScope` typed bare answered the same page (200).
"How and why" under Public Sandbox read "…confident that you are
correctly identified…" with no deposit sentence; under Member Sandbox
"…confident you are correctly identified…" plus "In addition, publication
metadata will automatically be pushed to your ORCID record…" and a link
"Six ways to make your ORCID iD work for you!". The page's links: the
breadcrumb "Home" (the context's front page) and two info.orcid.org
articles; the "Requesting updated ORCID record access" email links the
page too.

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — {OJS} Row action: `useReviewerManagerConfig.js` pushes
`Actions.REVIEWER_SEND_TO_ORCID` (label
`dashboard.reviewAssignment.action.sendReviewToOrcid` = "Send Review To
ORCID") when `reviewAssignment.reviewerHasOrcid &&
pkp.const.REVIEW_ASSIGNMENT_STATUS_COMPLETE` — the second operand is a bare
constant, always truthy (finding A1); `reviewerHasOrcid` =
reviewer's `orcidIsVerified` and not anonymized
(`PKP\submission\maps\Schema`). The guard carries no API-type term;
live-probed 2026-08-07 on a Public Sandbox (public-API) journal: the
completed review's row menu offered "Send Review To ORCID", the dialog read
"Send this review to the reviewer's ORCID?" with OK/Cancel, and confirming
returned 200 with an empty body and closed the dialog with no message. The
deposits-nothing half of that clause stays code-anchored — the deposit
itself is unobservable in-env — per the `DepositOrcidReview::handle()`
member-API gate below. Dialog + POST
`reviews/{submissionId}/{reviewAssignmentId}/sendToOrcid`
(`PKPReviewController::sendToOrcid`, roles Site Admin/Manager/Sub-editor) →
`APP\orcid\actions\SendReviewToOrcid` (OJS: chains
`ReconcileOrcidReviewPutCode` (JOB-034) + `DepositOrcidReview` (JOB-033);
OMP/OPS: base no-op). `DepositOrcidReview::handle()` returns unless status ∈
`REVIEW_COMPLETE_STATUSES`, member API on, and
`OrcidManager::getCity() && getCountry()` — the silent City+country
requirement; public-scope token → dispatches `SendUpdateScopeMail`
(JOB-020). Publication-time review deposits:
`PKPSendSubmissionToOrcid::depositReviewsForSubmission()`. Live-probed
2026-08-07 (OJS + OMP): dialog title "Send Review To ORCID", message "Send
this review to the reviewer's ORCID?", OK/Cancel; confirming succeeded with
no on-screen feedback of any kind. Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, two runs;
Rule 12, Fields "City"): Member Sandbox, country Canada, a completed
review by a member-scope verified reviewer: with City "Burnaby", "OK"
answered 200 `[]` with no notice, at once or 5.5 seconds later, and the
queued `DepositOrcidReview` tried `…/v3.0/<iD>/peer-review`; with City
empty, the same answer and silence, the job ending without contacting
ORCID (no failed row); with City set and no country, finding OJS1.
Publishing the reviewed article queued one `DepositOrcidReview` per
reviewer, only the completed review's trying ORCID. Public Sandbox: the
completed review's row offered the entry, "OK" 200, the job ending with
no failed row. OMP (two runs): the entry on a verified reviewer's row
for the Site Administrator, the Press Manager and the assigned Series
Editor, "OK" 200, nothing queued; OPS has no Reviewers panel.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — Display value/icons: `Identity::getOrcidDisplayValue()` appends
`orcid.unauthenticated` ("(unauthenticated)") for an unverified iD; solid
(`orcid.svg`) vs hollow (`orcid_unauthenticated.svg`) icon on the same
guard. Live-probed 2026-08-07 (OJS, reviewer list instance of the same
display logic): unauthenticated case rendered the hollow icon + suffixed
link, verified case the solid icon + bare iD link.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — Registration: `RegistrationForm::fetch()` assigns the block only for
context registration (`$request->getContext() !== null` — code comment);
`orcidProfile.tpl` register variant renders hidden `orcid` field + connect
button. The popup's completion: note p. Live-probed
2026-08-07 (OJS): the block renders at the top of the journal registration
form and the form submits without it; the site-level registration page
shows none. Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs
each, signed out): `#connect-orcid-button` was the first control of
`form#register`, with "What is ORCID?" beside it; the form filled and
"Register" pressed without it answered "Registration complete", and the
new account's Identity tab offered "Create or Connect your ORCID iD";
the site's `index/user/register` had no ORCID block. The popup's return
`…/orcid/authorizeOrcid?targetOp=register&code=…` answered 500 with a
blank popup (finding A18). Live-probed 2026-10-19 (OJS, OMP, OPS on
`main` and `stable-3_5_0`, each on a freshly loaded dataset), with a
local stand-in answering ORCID's token request `401`
`{"error":"invalid_client","error_description":"Client not found: APP-TEST"}`:
the same register return answered 200 with a script whose first line,
`opener.pkp.eventBus.$emit("notify", "ORCID authorization failed:
Client not found: APP-TEST. Reason: invalid_client.", …)`, threw
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'eventBus')`
in the popup, since the reader-side registration page carries no
`pkp.eventBus` (`AuthorizeUserData::renderFrontendErrorNotification()`);
`window.close()` was never reached, the popup stayed open and blank,
and the form showed no notice (finding A18). On the profile the same
`401` closed the popup with Rule 6d's notice (note c).

schedule & versions check (OJS, "Member Sandbox", a contributor with a
verified iD and token, a journal with no issues): the publish request
failed on the server in the OJS work builder's issue read
(`OrcidWork::getAppDoiExternalIds`), the publication was published after
a reload, and no `DepositOrcidSubmission` was queued; the evidence and
its controls are that spec's note f-ojs4. Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS,
two runs, Member Sandbox, a contributor with a verified iD): on a
journal with no issues and DOIs on (a new context's default), and on a

window read "…will be published immediately without any issue
association…", "Publish" answered 500 `{"error":"Call to a member

has occurred. Please reload the page and try again.", the reload showed
"Published" and nothing was queued; with DOIs off (`enableDois: false`)
and no issues the same publish answered 200 with no notice and the
deposit was queued and tried. Rule 11, live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS into
an issue, OPS; Member Sandbox; two runs each): before the publish no
ORCID job; after it `DepositOrcidSubmission` for the contributor with a
live member-scope token (tried `…/v3.0/<iD>/work`) and for one holding a
stored put-code (tried `…/work/<put-code>`, the update in place), none
for an expired token (a `RevokeOrcidToken` instead) nor for an
unauthenticated iD; the public-scope contributor's job queued
"Requesting updated ORCID record access" (finding A14). OMP, the same
seeds: nothing queued (OMP1). Rule 11's trigger and the stored
put-code, live-probed 2026-10-21 (OJS and OPS on `main` and
`stable-3_5_0`, Member Sandbox, on PKP's default test dataset; a
contributor's verified iD and member-scope token set in the database as
`VerifyIdentityWithOrcid::saveIdentityData()` stores them; ORCID's work
service answered by a local stand-in, the kept check
`shared/playwright/checks/U04/H21/deposits.js` with `work-stub.js`;
two runs per case): publishing into the published "Vol. 1 No. 2
(2014)" (OJS) or posting (OPS) queued one `DepositOrcidSubmission`,
which sent one `POST …/v3.0/<iD>/work`; on its 201 the put-code ORCID's
answer returns was stored as the author's `orcidWorkPutCode`.
Scheduling an OJS article into the unpublished "Vol. 2 No. 1 (2015)":
the confirm window read "This will be published when Vol. 2 No. 1
(2015) is published. Are you sure you want to schedule this for
publication?" with "Schedule For Publication", the publication was
stored scheduled (status 5), and the same single `POST …/work` went out
at once, the put-code stored, while the issue stayed unpublished (main
and 3.5). Sending on schedule is deliberate: the listener's
published-or-scheduled condition carries over the 3.4 ORCID Profile
plugin's `handlePublicationStatusChange()`. On `stable-3_5_0` the
search-index jobs a publish queues build the work again
(pkp/pkp-lib#10744) and send it as an update (`PUT …/work/<put-code>`),
so no second work appears; `main` dropped that path with its search
rewrite (pkp/pkp-lib#8920). Publishing with an
unauthenticated or duplicate iD (Cross-feature interactions): live-probed

default test dataset with ORCID on Public Sandbox; the iD rows set in the database
and read on the contributor's ORCID iD field first). The final window
("Schedule For Publication"; "Post the preprint" on OPS) listed, under
"The following issues were found, but will not prevent publishing",
"Unauthenticated ORCiDs for contributors detected." for one contributor
with an unverified iD and for two contributors sharing an unverified
iD, and "Duplicate ORCiDs for contributors detected." for two
contributors sharing a verified iD; it still offered "Publish" ("Post"),
which published the publication each time.

decision exists in OPS — finding OPS1; label text —
finding A6. Listeners auto-discover from `lib/pkp/classes/observers/
listeners` in all three apps (`EventServiceProvider`). Live-probed
2026-08-07 (OJS deep, OMP spot): with the toggle on, "Accept Submission"
and "Accept and Skip Review" each delivered one "Submission ORCID" mail per
contributor alongside the decision mail; with it off, only the decision
mail arrived.

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — Emails: `SendAuthorMail` picks
`OrcidRequestAuthorAuthorization` (member API; key
`ORCID_REQUEST_AUTHOR_AUTHORIZATION`, name "Requesting ORCID record
access") vs `OrcidCollectAuthorId` (public; key `ORCID_COLLECT_AUTHOR_ID`,
name "Submission ORCID"); `SendUpdateScopeMail` sends
`OrcidRequestUpdateScope` (key `ORCID_REQUEST_UPDATE_SCOPE`, name
"Requesting updated ORCID record access"). All from the
principal contact, to the contributor, with variables `authorOrcidUrl`
(single-use OAuth link; token `orcidEmailToken`) + `orcidAboutUrl`
(`OrcidVariables`). Template keys seeded in every app's
`registry/emailTemplates.xml`. Roster gaps: OPS
`classes/mail/Repository::map()` replaces the base list and includes no
ORCID mailable (finding OPS2; OJS map lists the two request mailables, OMP
merges OJS's); `OrcidRequestUpdateScope` is in no app's map (finding A7).
Live-probed 2026-08-07: the public-API request delivered "Submission
ORCID" and the member-API request "Requesting ORCID record access" (wider
permission in its link), from the principal contact, in all three apps. On
the Emails settings screen the two listed rows are titled by internal name
— "orcidCollectAuthorId", "orcidRequestAuthorAuthorization" — so a manager
finds them by searching "ORCID", not by the names above; the row naming
itself is the Emails-management feature's territory.
What the request emails say (Rule 14a): live-probed 2026-10-09 at the
PR head `e29a720de0`, before its merge (pkp/pkp-lib#13493, issue
pkp/pkp-lib#13283; OJS, OMP and OPS, on PKP's default test dataset, the
three ORCID
templates re-installed with `php lib/pkp/tools/installEmailTemplate.php`
before the read, since the dataset's database was installed before the
PR and its stored default bodies predate it).
"Request verification" under Public Sandbox delivered "Submission
ORCID" from the principal contact (Ramiro Vaca), opening "Dear Mark
Irvine," and reading "You have been listed as an author on a manuscript
submission "Computer Skill Requirements for New and Existing Teachers:
Implications for Policy and Practice" to Journal of Public Knowledge.";
under Member Sandbox, "Requesting ORCID record access" read "You have
been listed as an author on the manuscript submission "The influence of
lactation on the quantity and quality of cashmere production" to
Journal of Public Knowledge." Both closed "This is an automated message
from Journal of Public Knowledge." (OMP: "…to Public Knowledge Press.",
"…from Public Knowledge Press."; OPS: "…to Public Knowledge Preprint
Server.", "…from Public Knowledge Preprint Server."). The bodies end
`{$contextSignature}`, the context's `emailSignature` setting, whose
default is `default.contextSettings.emailSignature`; the `OrcidVariables`
trait no longer offers `principalContactSignature`. "Requesting updated
ORCID record access" carries the same `{$recipientName}`,
`{$submissionTitle}` and `{$contextSignature}` in its template and was
not delivered in this drive. Customized emails: on `stable-3_5_0`
datasets upgraded to the PR head (OJS, OMP, OPS), a customized
"Submission ORCID" still written with `{$authorName}` and
`{$principalContactSignature}` arrived afterwards opening "Dear Carlo
Corino,", with the journal's own sentence, no title, and the journal's
signature at the end
(`PKP\migration\upgrade\v3_5_0\I13283_RestoreDegradedOrcidFunctionality`

**n** — French interface (Rule 17): live-probed 2026-09-28 (OJS,

under "UI" and "Forms"): Administration › Site Settings (French address
`index/fr_CA/admin/settings`) › "Réglage du site" › "Plugiciel de profil
ORCID" showed the group label "ORCID", the two raw codes, and once ticked
"API ORCID" (default "Public"), "Identifiant ORCID du client", "Clé
secrète du client", each "Obligatoire"; Settings › Users & Roles read
"Utilisateurs-trices", "Rôles", "Options d'accès au site", "Plugiciel de
profil ORCID", its form in French with no raw code ("Activer la
fonctionnalité ORCID", "Ville", "Paramètres des courriels", "Journal des
enregistrements ORCID"). On the workflow's Contributors › "Modifier",
untranslated text keys on the contributor's ORCID iD field (its request
button and question window, the requested state and resend link, an
unauthenticated iD's note, "Delete"'s question window); "Oui" posted the request
(`orcid/requestAuthorVerification`, 200) and the removal
(`orcid/deleteForAuthor`, 200), the field then showing the requested
state or the raw request button again, the same after the form was
reopened. English controls on the same scratch journal as in Rules 8
and 8a, with the question windows titled "Request ORCID verification"
and "Delete ORCID". Cause: lib/pkp's `locale/fr_CA/user.po`, shared by
the three apps, translates `orcid.displayName` (both tab names) as
"Plugiciel de profil ORCID" and has none of `orcid.manager.siteWide.*`
nor any of the nine `orcid.field.*` messages `FieldOrcid.vue` asks for
(the ninth, `.authorEmailModal.message.noAuthor`, is the added
contributor's sentence of Rule 8, not driven in French).

<a id="fn-o"></a>
**o** — The two landings, live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on
`main`, two runs each, signed out), with ORCID's token answer stood in
locally, since the test installs reach no outside service. Success: the
request email's link returned with a code showed "ORCID Authorization",
the iD as a link with the solid icon, "Your ORCID iD has been verified
and successfully associated with the submission." and "You will now be
automatically directed back to {context name}."; 10.1 to 10.2 seconds
later (16 landings) the page was at the context's front page
(`{context}/index`). The contributor then held the verified iD and a
token, and the email token was gone. The same link returned again with a
new code answered "An ORCID iD was already stored for this submission."
and sent no token request. The "already stored" answer is also reached
by address alone, with no stand-in: a seeded verified contributor of the
context's own submission, a token it does not hold, its `author_id`, and
`state` its publication; the same address with another `author_id`
answered "Your ORCID iD could not be verified. The link is no longer
valid.". Mechanism (`frontend/pages/orcidVerify.tpl`, note f): the
success branch `orcid.verify.success` with its 10-second redirect
(`orcid.verify.success.redirect`); success clears `orcidEmailToken`
(`VerifyIdentityWithOrcid`), and `getAuthorToVerify()` sets
`orcid.verify.duplicateOrcid` when the token matches nobody and
`author_id` names a verified contributor of the `state` publication.

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — Read from the code, not seen running (Rule 7's completion;
finding A3): `AuthorizeUserData` case `register` fetches name, email,
country and employment from ORCID's record and fills the form fields by
script, the iD into the hidden `orcid` field (note i), hiding the connect
button; no token is stored anywhere (the
account does not exist yet), and `RegistrationForm::execute()` saves
only `$user->setOrcid(...)`, never `orcidIsVerified`. The test installs
reach no ORCID service, and the stand-in for ORCID's token answer used on
2026-10-16 (note o) does not answer the record request this step also
makes; with ORCID unreachable the registration popup's return goes blank
(finding A18).

<a id="fn-q"></a>
**q** — Plugins (Rule 16): live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on
`main`, two runs each): Settings › Website › Plugins, its "Installed
Plugins" tab (the gallery not read), listed no ORCID row in any app (on OPS "Generic Plugins (8)", Citation Style Language to Web
Feed Plugin). Neither the `main` nor the `stable-3_5_0` ops checkout
holds `plugins/generic/orcidProfile`; pkp/pkp-lib#9771 removed the
bundled plugin (ops `4316a40de4`, 2024-06-07). Finding OPS3, retired.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Scenario seeding: scratch journals/submissions via the scenario
endpoints (`POST scenarios/context`, `POST scenarios/submission`,
`scenarios.md`), one scratch context per test and app, its tag carrying app,
scenario and run, every account a `users[]` entry (`<username>@mail.test`,
password the username twice), the Journal Manager a `manager` role entry.
ORCID is enabled with dummy sandbox credentials through the context's
`orcid` key (`orcid: {}` = enabled, Public Sandbox, the dummy
`APP-TESTCLIENTID` pair; scenario 1's and scenario 7's first journal omit the
key, which leaves ORCID off; scenario 9's journal and scenario 4's second
journal pass `apiType: memberSandbox`; scenario 8's two journals pass
`sendMailToAuthorsOnPublication` true and false). The OAuth exchange itself
needs orcid.org — outbound HTTP fails fast at the test config's dead-port
`[proxy]`, and no real ORCID account backs the dummy pair — so scenario
steps stop at the popup/emailed link, and deposit outcomes rest on code,
notes g and j. Verified/unauthenticated iDs are seeded directly
(`user_settings`/`author_settings`: `orcid`, `orcidIsVerified` — recipe
proven in the 2026-08-07 reviewer-list probe; since 2026-09-13 a verified
seed also stamps the access-token fields the profile popup's completion
stores, so it counts as live for Rules 11 and 13, as the 2026-09-13 OJS
serial run showed: no "Submission ORCID" to the verified submitter after
Accept beside the unverified contributor's), the iD ORCID's sandbox
example `https://sandbox.orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097`: a `users[]` entry
with `orcid` and `orcidIsVerified: true` is scenario 3's first user and
scenario 9's first reviewer (`externalReviewer`), with `orcidIsVerified:
false` scenario 3's second user; scenario 9's second reviewer and scenario
4's contributors carry no `orcid`; the submission seed's `author: {orcid,
orcidIsVerified}` sets the submitter's contributor record, `false` for
scenario 5's unauthenticated contributor and `true` for the submitter of
scenario 8's second submission on the toggle-on journal. Scenario 9's
submission carries `decisions: ['sendExternalReview']` and one
`reviewRounds[]` entry naming both reviewers `accepted`; the review is
completed on screen through the reviewer wizard before the row action is
pressed. Every ORCID mailable is queued mail and the fleets run with the
job runner off, so scenarios 4, 8 and 11, the three that read the mail
catcher, live in each app's `tests/serial/` suite, which drains the queue (`php
lib/pkp/tools/jobs.php run`) after the action and reads Mailpit scoped by
the throwaway recipient; every silence claim (scenario 8's toggle-off
journal and its verified submitter, scenario 4's not-yet-saved contributor,
scenario 11's unpublished submission) waits on a positive control
delivered by the same drain; scenario 4's resend is pressed after a
drain has delivered the first request (a resend while it is still
queued sends nothing, A24) and read as a second "Submission ORCID" to
the same contributor after the next drain, and the email's wording read against
the contributor's seeded name, the submission's seeded title and the
scratch journal's default email signature. Scenario 4's
journals set `context.contactName` ("ORCID Contact <tag>") and
`context.contactEmail` (`contact-<tag>@mail.test`) and the request email's
From is read against them; its added contributor's address is
`nova-<tag>@mail.test`, typed on the Contributors list's add form (Given
Name, Email and the form's required Country). Scenario 7's second journal is
the enabled one (`orcid: {}`), the site-level Register page is the site's
`index/user/register` (present because the install hosts more than one
context once any scratch context exists), and its registration types a
throwaway username `u04s7-<app>` with `<username>@mail.test`. Scenario 6
types `{journal}/orcid/about` and `{journal}/orcid/verify`. Scenario 10's
submissions are two seeds by the same `author` submitter, `submitted: true`
(opened from the author's dashboard, My Submissions on OJS, whose
contributor list offers no edit on OJS and OMP; on OPS the row's "Edit" is
pressed, the field read and the form closed) and `submitted: false` (a wizard-resumable
draft that opens on "Upload Files"; the Contributors step is reached with
"Continue"; the request's email is queued mail the parallel suite never
drains, so the field alone is read); its Control signs in as the journal's
`manager` entry. Scenario 1's refused save presses the tab's "Save"
with the box ticked and both credential boxes empty, the Identity tab
read in a second page of the same session; its unsaved City is typed,
the "Roles" tab opened and the "ORCID" tab reopened, then the page left
for Settings › Journal (`management/settings/context`) and the tab
reopened; its plugins read is Settings › Website › Plugins, "Installed
Plugins", searched for "ORCID" beside a row the list does show as the
positive control. Scenario 11's journal is `orcid: {}` (Public Sandbox)
with `context.contactName` and `context.contactEmail` as scenario 4's;
its two submissions are seeded by two throwaway `author` submitters,
each `author: {orcid, orcidIsVerified: true}`, which on a Public Sandbox
context stores the public scope `/authenticate` (scenarios.md), so the
email follows from the API switch alone; on OJS the context carries one
`issues[]` entry and the submissions reach Production through
`decisions: ['skipExternalReview', 'sendToProduction']`, the first
published into that issue on its publication's screen (DOIs stay on, a
new context's default, so publishing without an issue would fail, Side
effects), and on OPS the first is posted. The API switch is the tab's
own "Save". The drain runs the deposit job, which queues the email, and
then the email; the email's links are read, never followed (A14).
Site-level ORCID stays off throughout: Site Settings →
ORCID is a shared singleton across every parallel worker and fleet.

**f-a1** — `useReviewerManagerConfig.js` "ORCID reviewer deposit" block:
`if (reviewAssignment.reviewerHasOrcid && pkp.const.REVIEW_ASSIGNMENT_STATUS_COMPLETE)`

non-zero) makes the guard `reviewerHasOrcid`-only. Deposit-side re-check:

an incomplete review's row the action is offered for a verified-iD
reviewer and absent for a no-iD reviewer (OJS); confirming on a completed
review succeeded with no feedback of any kind; a Press Manager gets the
same action, dialog and silent success (OMP — base `SendReviewToOrcid` is
a no-op there). Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OMP, two runs): the Site

`locale/` tree (the defined key is `orcid.verify.denied`, which nothing
renders). Missing keys render as `##orcid.authDenied##`. The branch is
reached without ORCID's consent screen: "Deny" there only returns the
browser to the authorization link's `redirect_uri`
(`{journal}/orcid/verify?token=…&state=…&author_id=…`) with
`error=access_denied&error_description=…` appended, and that address,
read from the verification email and opened directly, lands on the branch

is required). Live-probed 2026-10-03 on `main` and `stable-3_5_0`, OJS, OMP and
OPS, signed out, on the default datasets with a Member Sandbox placeholder
client (kept walk
`shared/playwright/checks/issues/orcid-denied-page-raw-placeholder/walk.js`):
under "ORCID Authorization" the failure box read `##orcid.authDenied##`,
then the `orcid.failure.contact` line; the page answered 200 with no
console error; a denial carrying a token no contributor holds showed the
generic "could not be verified" failure instead. ORCID's consent screen
itself was not driven (orcid.org is unreachable through the dead-port
`[proxy]`, and the placeholder client would be refused).

seeded in all three registries. Live-probed 2026-08-07: an "ORCID" search
of the Emails screen returns no row for it in any app (the two request
templates are listed on OJS and OMP). Update 2026-08-25 (rebase check):
pkp/pkp-lib#13050 adds `OrcidRequestUpdateScope` (with two unrelated
mailables) to the lib/pkp `Repository::map()`, which OJS and OMP merge; OPS's
override still builds its own list without it, so the OPS absence stands.

(`classes/orcid/OrcidManager.php:304`) dispatches `RevokeOrcidToken`
storing the whole Author (`jobs/orcid/RevokeOrcidToken.php:29-33`); the
queue dispatch `serialize()`s the closures and throws. The same bug
class was fixed for `SendAuthorMail` in daad5785 (`.collect()` of the
three fields in the constructor) but not here.
`jobs/orcid/DepositOrcidSubmission.php:33` holds a `private Author
$author` too (latent, same landmine), and
`classes/orcid/actions/PKPSendSubmissionToOrcid.php:67` calls the revoke
path from deposit error handling (latent). CLI probe 2026-08-28 on a
seeded install: `serialize(Author)` and `serialize(job)` both throw, and
collecting the three fields fixes serialization. Reported to the team
2026-08-28 (the maintainer has the report). Scenario 5 (suite S5) fails
on all three apps at the 2026-08-29 tips (ojs 0471e029b9 /
omp d34542e83 / ops 28d4cb1dff, lib/pkp 13b621e42); still present at
main 2026-08-29 — per convention the test stays red until the upstream
fix lands (the reds are the bug, not drift). The profile disconnect
(note d) acts on a User, which carries no LazyCollections — unaffected.
Retired 2026-09-03: fixed upstream by pkp-lib `ecd12271ed` ("pkp/pkp-lib#13003
Fix audit report issues") plus `d9e9b3fc7c` ("Do not attempt to serialize
LazyCollections"). Verified fully green on OJS in pkp/ojs Actions run
33466736951 (2026-09-01); on 2026-09-03 both commits sit in OMP's and OPS's
`lib/pkp` (OMP `a1aefa3fe`, OPS `6bda92fb03`) and the apps' own e2e runs at
those tips are green (pkp/omp run 33629780688, pkp/ops run 33629815586, both
2026-09-02). Scenario 5 (suite S5) passes on all three apps again.

**f-a11** — Note n (the tabs, the locale cause). Seen
identically on OJS, OMP and OPS in two runs, 2026-09-28; the English
interface is the control (note b). The run records list a server error on
every Site Settings load, from the Plugin Gallery's list
([Plugins management A1](U62-plugins-management.md#a1)); the ORCID tab
itself failed nothing, so the entry carries no crash word.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#739](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/739) ([docs/issues/U04-A11-orcid-tabs-named-after-old-plugin.md](../issues/U04-A11-orcid-tabs-named-after-old-plugin.md)).

<a id="fn-a12"></a>
**f-a12** — Note n (every code, the two requests answering 200, the
locale cause). Seen identically on OJS, OMP and OPS in two runs,
2026-09-28, with no failure behind either request; the English field on
the same journals is the control.

<a id="fn-a13"></a>
**f-a13** — Note d: `identityForm.tpl` renders `#deleteOrcidButton` and its
confirmation only under `{if $orcid && $orcidAuthenticated}`; the
unauthenticated branch of `orcidProfile.tpl` renders the hollow-icon link
and the `orcid.authorise` button and nothing else. Contrast note e:
`FieldOrcid.vue` offers its delete button for an unverified iD beside
`orcid.field.unverified.shouldRequest`. Live-probed 2026-10-01 (OJS, two runs;
the `orcid` phase of `shared/playwright/checks/U14/Ks01/ks01.js`): a
throwaway Reader seeded with an unverified iD, signed in on a journal with
ORCID on, found no "Delete" on the Identity tab, while a second Reader's
verified iD offered it. OMP and OPS were not walked by that check; both
templates are identical in their lib/pkp, with no app override, and each
app's scenario 3 test already expects no `#deleteOrcidButton` on the
second user's unauthenticated tab.

<a id="fn-a14"></a>
**f-a14** — Live-probed 2026-10-05 on `main` (OJS and OPS, two runs each)
and `stable-3_5_0` (OJS and OPS, two runs each), signed out: a scratch
context on Public Sandbox (dummy `APP-TESTCLIENTID` pair) with a
submission whose contributor seed carries `orcid` and `orcidIsVerified:
true` (token scope `/authenticate`); the ORCID tab switched to "Member
Sandbox" on screen and saved; the article published on screen
("Schedule For Publication" › "Publish"; OPS "Post"); the queue drained
(`DepositOrcidSubmission`, then `SendUpdateScopeMail`). The contributor
received "Requesting updated ORCID record access" from the principal
contact ("Site Admin" on the scratch context), with ORCID's authorize
address twice (scope `/activities/update`) and the What-is-ORCID link;
ORCID's service is not needed for this half. Its `redirect_uri`,
`…/orcid/updateScope?token=…&itemId=…&itemType=work&userId=…&userIdType=author`
(no `state`), opened with `error=access_denied&error_description=…`
(Deny) or with `code=…` (Authorize), answered 500 with an empty page
every time, the server log reading "Uncaught TypeError:
PKP\orcid\actions\VerifyIdentityWithOrcid::__construct(): Argument #1
($identity) must be of type PKP\identity\Identity, null given, called in
…/lib/pkp/pages/orcid/OrcidHandler.php"; afterwards the contributor's
scope was still `/authenticate`, no `orcidAccessDenied` was stored and
the email token remained. OMP (no deposits, so no email): the same
address typed answered the same 500 on `main` and 3.5. Controls: on the
same contexts the verification request's link (`…/orcid/verify?…&state=…`)
returned the same two ways answered the "ORCID Authorization" page (200),
and `updateScope` typed bare answered the "no longer valid" page (200).
Mechanism: `SendUpdateScopeMail::handle()` builds the link without
`state`; `OrcidHandler::updateScope()` → `getIdentityToVerify()` →
`getAuthorToVerify()` filters the publication's authors by `state`, finds
none, prepares the failure (`handleNoAuthorWithToken()`) and goes on,
since `itemType` is set, to `new VerifyIdentityWithOrcid(null, …)`. The
handler and the job are the same on `stable-3_5_0`. A reviewer's
re-authorization (OJS `DepositOrcidReview` dispatches the same email
with `itemType=review`; `getReviewerToVerify()` looks the user up by
`userId` and token, without `state`) was not driven.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#932](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/932) ([docs/issues/U04-A14-orcid-reauthorization-link-blank-page.md](../issues/U04-A14-orcid-reauthorization-link-blank-page.md)).

<a id="fn-a15"></a>
**f-a15** — Live-probed 2026-10-05 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs,
signed out and as Site Administrator, Journal Manager and Author; on
`stable-3_5_0` signed out, the same): the `<title>` of `…/orcid/about`,
`…/orcid/verify` and `…/orcid/updateScope` read "| {context name}",
while the same context's "About the Journal" ("About the Press", "About
the Server") and "Login" pages read "About the Journal | {context name}"
and "Login | {context name}". Cause: `orcidAbout.tpl` and
`orcidVerify.tpl` include `frontend/components/header.tpl` without a
`pageTitle` (contrast `userLogin.tpl`, `pageTitle="user.login"`).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#933](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/933) ([docs/issues/U04-A15-orcid-pages-tab-no-page-name.md](../issues/U04-A15-orcid-pages-tab-no-page-name.md)).

<a id="fn-a16"></a>
**f-a16** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs
each): the tab's choices "Errors" and "All" with the description quoted
in the entry; with "Errors" saved, a typed
`{journal}/orcid/verify?token=<none>&state=1&author_id=1` wrote
`production.ERROR: OrcidHandler::verify = No author found with supplied
token` to the application log (`<files_dir>/logs/app-<date>.log`); with
"All" saved, the same visit wrote nothing. Under "All", publishing wrote
`production.INFO` lines from the publish request ("Request body (without
put-code): …", "Submitting reviews for submission …"; OJS, OPS); the
drained deposits and token revocations wrote no ORCID information line
at either level, while their connection failures appeared as
`production.ERROR: cURL error 7 … for https://…orcid.org/…` at both.
Mechanism: `OrcidManager::logError()` returns unless the level is
`ERROR`, `logInfo()` unless it is `INFO`; a queued job has no request, so
`getLogLevel()` falls back to `ERROR`.

<a id="fn-a17"></a>
**f-a17** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS three runs, OMP and OPS two each,
on `main`; the site record put back after each window): with "Enable
ORCID functionality site-wide" ticked and saved (Public Sandbox,
`APP-TEST`), "Save" on the tab of a journal whose own ORCID was off
posted `orcidEnabled=true&orcidCity=…&orcidSendMailToAuthorsOnPublication=false&orcidLogLevel=ERROR`
(200) and stored `orcidEnabled=1` beside an empty `orcidClientId`.
Site-wide unticked, the journal's rows were unchanged, its Identity tab
and Register page offered "Create or Connect your ORCID iD", and the
sign-in address behind it carried an empty `client_id`. Mechanism:
`OrcidSettingsForm` gives the disabled enable option the value true
while `OrcidManager::isGloballyConfigured()`, and the form posts it; the
same code on `stable-3_5_0` (read, not driven there).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#1006](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/1006) ([docs/issues/U04-A17-orcid-locked-tab-save-switches-journal-on.md](../issues/U04-A17-orcid-locked-tab-save-switches-journal-on.md)).

<a id="fn-a18"></a>
**f-a18** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs
each, OJS a third), ORCID unreachable through the test config's
dead-port `[proxy]`: the popup's returns
`{journal}/orcid/authorizeOrcid?targetOp=profile&code=…`,
`…?targetOp=profile&error=access_denied&error_description=…` and
`…?targetOp=register&code=…` answered 500 with an empty page, the popup
stayed open, the profile's notices were empty and no setting changed;
the server log read "PHP Fatal error: Uncaught
GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException: cURL error 7: Failed to connect to
pub.sandbox.orcid.org port 443 … for
https://pub.sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/token". With a local stand-in for
ORCID's token answer (two runs per app), a token request answered 500
gave the same blank, open popup and no notice ("Uncaught
GuzzleHttp\Exception\ServerException: Server error: `POST
https://pub.sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/token` resulted in a `500 Internal
Server Error` response"); a 401 gave Rule 6d's notice (note c).
Mechanism: `AuthorizeUserData::execute()` catches only the token
request's `ClientException`, ORCID's refusals; the same catch on
`stable-3_5_0` (read, not driven there).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#1007](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/1007) ([docs/issues/U04-A18-orcid-popup-blank-when-orcid-unreachable.md](../issues/U04-A18-orcid-popup-blank-when-orcid-unreachable.md)).

<a id="fn-a19"></a>
**f-a19** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs
each): a user with a verified iD typed "VeraChanged" over "Vera" in
"Given Name", then pressed "Delete" and "OK": the tab and a reload read
"Vera", the stored name stayed "Vera", the iD was removed, no notice.
Control: the same unsaved change and another profile tab pressed asked
"The data on this form has changed. Do you wish to continue without
saving?"; leaving the profile for another page asked nothing.

<a id="fn-a20"></a>
**f-a20** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS, OMP, OPS on `main`, two runs
each): "Delete" › "Yes" beside a contributor's unauthenticated iD
(`orcid/deleteForAuthor`, 200) queued `RevokeOrcidToken` as the verified
one's did; drained, both tried `https://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/revoke`
(and failed at the test config's dead-port `[proxy]`).
`OrcidController::deleteForAuthor()` calls
`OrcidManager::removeOrcidAccessToken()` (note f-a10), which dispatches
the job whatever the iD's state; the job posts whatever
`orcidAccessToken` holds, here nothing.

<a id="fn-a21"></a>
**f-a21** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS and OPS on `main`, two runs
each): the "Requesting updated ORCID record access" email delivered
after a publish (note f-a14's setup) read "…and we require updateded
permissions to add your contribution to your ORCID profile.". The text
is `emails.orcidRequestUpdateScope.body` in lib/pkp's
`locale/en/emails.po`, shared by the three apps, the same on
`stable-3_5_0`.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#1008](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/1008) ([docs/issues/U04-A21-orcid-update-scope-email-updateded.md](../issues/U04-A21-orcid-update-scope-email-updateded.md)).

<a id="fn-a22"></a>
**f-a22** — The landings: note f (live-probed 2026-10-16, OJS, OMP,
OPS, two runs each). `frontend/pages/orcidVerify.tpl` shows
`orcid.verify.sendSubmissionToOrcid.success` ("The submission has been
added to your ORCID record.") only under `$sendSubmission`, which
`OrcidHandler::verify()` assigns false and nothing sets otherwise
(`VerifyIdentityWithOrcid` sets only `sendSubmissionSuccess`), on `main`
and on `stable-3_5_0`.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#1009](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/1009) ([docs/issues/U04-A22-orcid-landing-silent-on-deposit.md](../issues/U04-A22-orcid-landing-silent-on-deposit.md)).

<a id="fn-a23"></a>
**f-a23** — `PKPSubmissionController::editPublication()` still dispatches
`MetadataChanged` after the save (lib/pkp `1f415a07ca`,
`api/v1/submissions/PKPSubmissionController.php:1457`), but `main` has no
listener for it: pkp/pkp-lib#8920's search rewrite (lib/pkp `b44cf27793`,
OJS `71a7bfccec`, OPS `43359941c6`, 2025-08-01) deleted
`MetadataChangedListener` and `MetadataChangedJob`, whose
`submissionMetadataChanged()` on 3.5 (OJS `ArticleSearchIndex.php:81-83`,
OPS `PreprintSearchIndex.php:80-83`) dispatched the ORCID send. The only
senders left are the publish listener (`SendSubmissionToOrcid.php:46-49`)
and the verification landing (`VerifyIdentityWithOrcid.php:205`).
Live-probed 2026-10-22 on OJS and OPS `main` (ojs `d05d8078d3`, ops
`5091e916d9`), scratch member-sandbox contexts, a published item whose
contributor holds a verified iD: the publish queued `DepositOrcidSubmission`;
the "Title & Abstract" save answered 200 and queued nothing (read from the
`jobs` table; no ORCID stand-in on the slot fleet). On OJS
`stable-3_5_0` the same save queued a `MetadataChangedJob`. Report:
`docs/reports/2026-10-22-pkp-lib-8920.md`; kept script
`shared/playwright/checks/sync/pkp-lib-8920/metadata-changed.js`.

<a id="fn-a24"></a>
**f-a24** — Test run 2026-10-26 (OMP on `main`, scenario 4 run alone in
the serial suite, job runner off): "Request verification" confirmed,
then "Resend Verification Email" confirmed before any queue drain, then
one drain: the contributor's mailbox held one "Submission ORCID", not
two; the field read "ORCID Verification has been requested!" with the
resend link throughout. OPS's test run the same day saw the same.
`OrcidController::requestAuthorVerification()` dispatches
`PKP\jobs\orcid\SendAuthorMail` on every press, and the job implements
`ShouldBeUnique` with `uniqueId()` the author id, so a second dispatch
while the first is still queued is dropped. The shipped
`config.TEMPLATE.inc.php` sets `[queues] job_runner = On`, which runs
jobs at the end of each request; the docs' "deploy-jobs" page advises a
worker or cron instead for high-volume sites. Not yet run: request,
resend, drain against request, drain, resend, drain side by side, nor on
OJS (the same lib/pkp code). The suites' scenario 4 drains the queue
between the request and the resend.

<a id="fn-ojs1"></a>
**f-ojs1** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OJS on `main`, two runs): Member
Sandbox, City "Burnaby", no country, a completed review by a
member-scope verified reviewer: "Send Review To ORCID" › "OK" answered
200 `[]` with no notice, and the queued `DepositOrcidReview` failed (a
`failed_jobs` row) with "OrcidManager::getCountry(): Return value must
be of type string, null returned"; control, country Canada: the job
tried `…/peer-review` (note g). `OrcidManager::getCountry()` declares a
string and returns the journal's unset `country`; the same on
`stable-3_5_0` (read, not driven there). The A1 issue report lists this
failure among the job's outcomes.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#1010](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/1010) ([docs/issues/U04-OJS1-orcid-review-no-country-fails-in-background.md](../issues/U04-OJS1-orcid-review-no-country-fails-in-background.md)).

<a id="fn-ojs2"></a>
**f-ojs2** — Live-probed 2026-10-16 with a local stand-in for ORCID's
token answer (OJS on `main`, two runs; DOIs on, a new journal's
default): a member-API journal's article published without an issue,
its contributor asked by "Request verification", the email's link
returned with a code: GET
`{journal}/orcid/verify?token=…&state=…&author_id=…&code=…` answered 500
with a blank page, the server log reading "Uncaught Error: Call to a
member function getData() on null" in `OrcidWork::getAppDoiExternalIds()`
(via `VerifyIdentityWithOrcid::depositOrcidItem()` →
`SendSubmissionToOrcid::getOrcidWork()`). The contributor then held
`orcid`, `orcidIsVerified=1` and a token, and the link returned again
answered "An ORCID iD was already stored for this submission.". Control:
the same journal's article published into its issue landed on the
success page. The publish side is *Publish, schedule & versions*' OJS4
(note j). Re-walked 2026-10-19 on OJS `main` 6b4323ced7 by the issue
reporter, on PKP's default dataset: the same 500 and stored iD.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#549](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/549) ([docs/issues/U49-OJS4-publish-without-issue-orcid-contributor-error.md](../issues/U49-OJS4-publish-without-issue-orcid-contributor-error.md)).

<a id="fn-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — `omp-main/classes/orcid/actions/SendSubmissionToOrcid`:
`canDepositSubmission()` returns false, `getOrcidWork()` returns null;
base `PKPSendSubmissionToOrcid::execute()` early-returns on the flag with
`FIXME … once functionality added to OMP`. Everything identity-side is the
shared lib/pkp path (empty-chain evidence: OMP adds no other ORCID
overrides). The page text is the shared lib/pkp locale
`orcid.about.howAndWhyMemberAPI`; live-probed 2026-10-05 (OMP, two runs,
the ORCID tab switched to "Member Sandbox" on screen): `orcid/about` read
the deposit sentence quoted in the entry, absent under Public Sandbox.
Live-probed 2026-10-16 (OMP, two runs in each of two checks, Member
Sandbox): publishing queued no deposit and no mail (note j); the landing
after an emailed authorization, with a local stand-in for ORCID's token
answer, read "The submission will be added to your ORCID record during
publication." for a monograph not yet published (note f).

<a id="fn-ops1"></a>
**f-ops1** — Note k: the trigger decisions do not exist in OPS's decision
roster; the settings form is the shared note-a component, so the toggle
renders. Live-probed 2026-08-07: the OPS ORCID tab shows the toggle with
the identical label; a submitted preprint's workflow offers only "Post the
preprint" and "Decline Submission" — no accepting decision.

<a id="fn-ops2"></a>
**f-ops2** — Note l: OPS `Repository::map()` override ("OPS uses distinct
mailables") lists no ORCID mailable while the OPS registry seeds all three
templates; same mechanism as the invitation-template gap recorded in
[User invitations](U06-user-invitations.md). Live-probed 2026-08-07: searching
"ORCID" on the OPS Emails screen returns "No items found.", while "Request
verification" on a preprint contributor delivered the "Submission ORCID"
email (positive control).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#519](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/519) ([docs/issues/U06-OPS1-preprint-emails-list-misses-sent-emails.md](../issues/U06-OPS1-preprint-emails-list-misses-sent-emails.md)).

<a id="fn-ops3"></a>
**f-ops3** — `ops-main/plugins/generic/orcidProfile` (submodule, release
1.3.4.3 / 2023-02-17, lazy-load) — the pre-3.5 plugin generation; absent
from `ojs-main`/`omp-main` plugin trees. OPS also carries the full built-in
integration (`ops-main/classes/orcid/*` mirroring OJS minus reviews). An
`OrcidProfileEmailDataMigration` class inside the plugin suggests it is
kept for upgrade data migration. Live-probed 2026-08-07: OPS Website
Settings → Plugins lists one row among Generic Plugins — "ORCID Profile
Plugin", "Allows for the import of user profile information from ORCID.",
enable box present and unchecked (enabling not exercised), no error
rendered; OJS and OMP list no ORCID plugin row (absence controls).
Retired 2026-10-16: no app lists the plugin any more, and the ops
checkouts no longer hold it (note q).
