# Publish, schedule & versions {OJS OMP OPS}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

Every step before this one prepared the submission. This feature is the
last mile: an editor takes a publication version live. On a journal that is
the **Schedule For Publication** flow, where the editor chooses whether the
article joins an issue, goes live at once, or waits as *scheduled* until its
issue is published. On a press the **Publish** button makes the catalog
entry public. On a preprint server the **Post** button posts the preprint.
The same feature owns the way back (**Unpublish** / **Unschedule**) and the
version machinery: creating a new version of a published work, the version
stages and numbering ("Author Original", "Version of Record 2.1"), the
version list in the workflow's side menu, and the status readout
("Status: Published") that every role sees.

A preprint server's screens say **Post**/**Unpost**/**Posted** where a
journal's say Publish/Unpublish/Published, and its confirmation window is
titled "Post the preprint". The press's per-submission "Catalog Entry"
page and its catalog flags belong to
*Catalog management* (no spec yet); this spec owns only the act of
publishing. A journal's issues themselves, meaning creating, ordering and
publishing them, belong to *Issues* (no spec yet); this spec owns the
issue-assignment choices offered while publishing an article.

## Actors & permissions

Who reaches the workflow screen at all is
[→ stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-access).
**May publish** below is one gate shared by every control in
this feature: the user's role on the Production stage is Journal Manager,
Editor or Site Administrator, and they are not a recommending editor.
Section Editors, Guest
Editors and assistant roles never get these controls, however they are
assigned ⚠ [A2](#a2). On a preprint server that includes the Moderator
role, the role the server's own submission screens say will "review and
post" preprints. <sup>a</sup>

| Action | Who may — and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Publish** (journal: "Schedule For Publication"; press: "Publish"; preprint server: "Post") | • may-publish roles: while the shown version is not yet published or scheduled ⚠ [A2](#a2)<br>• the submitting Author on a preprint server: never by default. The confirmation window lists "You can not post your own preprint. It must be approved and posted by a moderator." as an unmet requirement. A screening plugin can lift this, but even then the author's workflow view offers no Post control ⚠ [OPS3](#ops3) <sup>b</sup> |
| **Unschedule** | • may-publish roles: while the shown version's status is "Scheduled" <sup>c</sup> |
| **Unpublish** ("Unpost") | • may-publish roles: while the shown version's status is "Published" <sup>c</sup> |
| **Preview** | • may-publish roles: on a not-yet-published version once the submission has moved past the Review stage (journal, press), and always on a scheduled version. This row is about the Preview among the publishing controls. The workflow window's own header shows a separate Preview/View button to every role <sup>d</sup> |
| **Create New Version** | • may-publish roles: the side menu's "Create New Version" item, offered whatever the current version's state <sup>e</sup> |
| **Fill the publishing details** (Publication Settings page {OJS} / Preprint Entry page {OPS}; the "Review Publishing Details" panel {OJS}) | • may-publish roles. The entry pages additionally save for whoever may edit the publication (see [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md)) <sup>f</sup> |
| **Switch versions / read the status** | • every role the Publication area admits, the Author included. The side menu lists each version by name, and every version page heads with "Status: {state}" <sup>g</sup> |

## Fields & validation

Three surfaces carry fields. Everything else in this feature is buttons and
confirmation windows.

**"Review Publishing Details" panel {OJS}**: the side panel a journal opens
on the way to publishing, when the version still needs its details
(Rule 3). <sup>h</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Publication Stage | Yes | Select: Author Original · Published Manuscript Under Review · Version of Record. |
| Revision Significance | Yes | Major Revision / Minor Revision. "Minor Revision" can be selected only when a version of the chosen stage already exists (Rule 12). |
| Update Type | No | Select, "New Version" preselected. The other choices name the reason for the version (Correction, Erratum, Retraction, …). |
| Summary of Changes (Amendment Notice) | No | Rich text, multilingual. The screen describes it as the public amendment notice, but no reader page shows it (Rule 13) ⚠ [A5](#a5). An "Insert Content" button on the submission-language box offers the change summaries authors saved with their review revisions (Rule 14). |
| Issue Assignment | Yes | Radio. The choices offered depend on which issues the journal has (Rule 5): Don't Assign To An Issue · Assign To Future Issue and Publish Immediately · Assign To Future Issue and Schedule Only · Assign To Current/Back Issue. The panel opens with the saved choice preselected. With nothing saved, "Assign To Current/Back Issue" is preselected whenever the journal has a published or back issue. With only future issues nothing is preselected, and the first pick misfires ⚠ [OJS2](#ojs2). |
| Issue | Yes, when the assignment names an issue | Select over the matching issues (future or published, per the chosen assignment). |
| Associated review round | No | Select over the submission's review rounds. It arrives pre-filled with the submission's round ("Round 1 — opened {date}"), so an untouched publish keeps the link. A "Published Manuscript Under Review" version is refused only once the round has been deliberately cleared (Rule 7). |

**Create New Version dialog** (all apps; Rule 11): "Which version should
metadata be copied from?" (a select over the existing versions), Publication
Stage (arrives preselected with the copied version's stage), and Revision
Significance (same minor rule; "Minor Revision" preselected whenever the
stage allows it), with Confirm/Cancel. An untouched Confirm therefore
answers everything (Rule 11). <sup>i</sup>

**Publication Settings page {OJS} / Preprint Entry page {OPS}**: the
Publication area's entry page. A press's counterpart is the Catalog Entry
page, described in *Catalog management*. It saves onto the shown version.
<sup>j</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Issue Assignment + Issue {OJS} | Yes | The same radio and select as the panel above. A choice saved here is remembered and arrives pre-checked when the panel opens. The exception is "Assign To Future Issue and Schedule Only" on a journal with no published issues, which comes back as the immediate-publish choice ⚠ [OJS2](#ojs2). |
| Section {OJS OPS} | Always has a value | Defaults to the submission's section. The select offers no empty choice, so it cannot be blanked. It carries no on-screen required mark; only Issue Assignment and Issue are marked "Required". |
| Publication Date {OJS} / Date Posted {OPS} | No | Must be a date in the form YYYY-MM-DD ("The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD, such as 2019-01-01."). The description warns to leave it empty unless backdating, because the date is normally set by publishing (Rule 8). On a press or preprint server a FUTURE date entered here is what schedules the item (Rule 6). |
| Update Type · Summary of Changes | No | As on the panel above. On a preprint server the summary box has no "Insert Content" button. |
| Cover Image · Pages {OJS} · URL Path | No | Display extras of the published item. |

## Rules & state

1. **A version's states.** Every version is in exactly one of three states.
   Not yet published: the readout is **"Status: Unscheduled"** on the
   version readers would get (with nothing published, that is the highest
   version, by stage then number), worded **"Unposted"** on a preprint
   server, and **"Unpublished"** on any other version, in every app.
   **"Scheduled"**: accepted for publication and waiting (Rule 5/6).
   **"Published"** ("Posted" on a preprint server). The readout heads every
   Publication page as "Status: {state}" with a colored dot. A journal's
   in-between states (an issue choice saved but not yet confirmed) also
   read "Unpublished". <sup>g</sup>
2. **One flow, staged differently per app.** The publish button sits at
   the top right of the Publication area for may-publish roles. It is
   labeled **"Schedule For Publication"** on a journal (it reads
   **"Publish"** only once the submission itself counts as published,
   which takes a published final-stage version, Rule 8 ⚠ [A3](#a3)),
   **"Publish"** on a press, and **"Post"** on a preprint server. A press
   or preprint server goes straight to the confirmation window (Rule 4). A
   journal first opens the "Review Publishing Details" panel when needed
   (Rule 3). The Submission stage's own "Schedule For Publication" shortcut
   button belongs to that stage (see
   [Submission stage](U25-submission-stage.md#schedule)); it lands on this
   area. The Production stage view shows a same-labeled action button
   ("Post the preprint" on a preprint server) to every role who can open
   the stage, publish-excluded roles included. For them it merely lands on
   a Publication area with nothing to press ⚠ [A2](#a2). Nothing
   stage-gates the real publish button either: a journal submission still
   in External Review already offers "Schedule For Publication". Only
   Preview waits for Review to pass (Actors). <sup>k</sup>
3. **The details panel opens only while details are missing {OJS}.**
   Pressing the journal's publish button opens "Review Publishing Details"
   (Fields) if the version has no Publication Stage yet or no confirmed
   issue choice. Confirm saves the choices and continues to the
   confirmation window. When a saved issue choice and stage are already in
   place, the button skips the panel and opens the confirmation window
   directly. The issue choice may have been saved on the Publication
   Settings page. The stage comes from an earlier act such as a panel
   save, the version dialog or a prior publish (the settings page itself
   carries no stage field). The panel opens with the saved issue choice
   preselected. With nothing saved, it uses the same default as the Fields
   table above. <sup>h</sup>
4. **The confirmation window.** The final window is titled "Schedule For
   Publication" on a journal and press, and "Post the preprint" on a
   preprint server. It shows, in order: an optional warning list ("The
   following issues were found, but will not prevent publishing"; none in
   a stock install, plugins add them), then either the confirmation text
   with a Publish/Post/Schedule For Publication button, or, when
   requirements are unmet, "The following requirements must be met before
   this can be published." ("…posted." on a preprint server) with the
   list and **no confirm button at all**. The confirmation text opens "All
   publication requirements have been met." ("All requirements have been
   met." on a preprint server) and names the version: "The publication
   version is "{version}"". The exception is a press or preprint server
   publishing a version with no stage yet. It shows "The publication must
   have a version stage assigned before it can be published." instead: a
   sentence phrased as an unmet requirement right under the all-met line,
   though it blocks nothing ⚠ [A7](#a7). On a journal whose settings
   *require* a plain language summary, a version without one gets neither
   text nor button. The Confirm is refused with no message and publishing
   is never reached ⚠ [OJS1](#ojs1). <sup>l</sup>
5. **What the issue choice decides {OJS}.** The four assignments map to
   outcomes. Only the choices the journal's issues allow are offered: with
   no future issue there are no "Future Issue" options, and with no issues
   at all Rule 15 applies.

   | Choice | Outcome on confirm |
   |---|---|
   | Don't Assign To An Issue | Published at once, no issue ("…published immediately without any issue association…") |
   | Assign To Future Issue and Publish Immediately | Published at once as continuous publication, listed with its still-unpublished issue ("…published immediately as continuous publication even though it is assigned to {issue} which is not published yet…") |
   | Assign To Future Issue and Schedule Only | **Scheduled**. The window's text promises "…published when {issue} is published…" and its button reads "Schedule For Publication" |
   | Assign To Current/Back Issue | Published at once into the chosen issue ("…published immediately in {issue}…") |

   ⚠ On a journal with no published issues (a future issue only), the
   panel does not honor the FIRST pick of "Assign To Future Issue and
   Schedule Only". The window offers immediate publication instead
   ("…published immediately…", button "Publish"), and confirming
   publishes at once [OJS2](#ojs2). Saving the choice on the Publication
   Settings page beforehand fares no better on that journal: the saved
   "Schedule Only" comes back as the immediate-publish choice. Only
   changing the radio to another choice and picking "Schedule Only" again
   before Confirm yields the promised scheduling window.

   A scheduled article goes live when its issue is published. Releasing
   it is part of publishing the issue (see *Issues*, no spec yet), not a
   clock. <sup>m</sup>
6. **Scheduling on a press or preprint server is by date.** There is no
   issue step. Publish/Post with the entry page's date field empty ("Date
   Published" on the press's Catalog Entry page, "Date Posted" on Preprint
   Entry) publishes now and stamps today. With a FUTURE date saved there,
   it sets status "Scheduled" instead. Neither window says so: the press's
   still promises to "make this catalog entry public" ⚠ [OMP1](#omp1),
   and the preprint server's still asks "…post this?" ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1). A
   scheduled press item is published by a once-daily background check
   when its date arrives. A preprint server has no such check, so a
   scheduled preprint waits forever unless someone unschedules and
   re-posts it ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1). <sup>n</sup>
7. **What blocks publishing.** The requirements list (Rule 4) refuses the
   following. In every app: a declined submission ("A declined submission
   can not be published." / "…posted."), and a contributor's
   unauthenticated or duplicated ORCID iD when ORCID is enabled (see
   [ORCID integration](U04-orcid-integration.md)). On a journal: an
   assigned issue that no longer exists; an unpaid publication fee once
   publication fees are fully in force (enabling payments and setting the
   fee is not enough, the chosen payment method must itself be completely
   set up, which is *Payments & APCs*'s territory); and a "Published
   Manuscript Under Review" version whose associated review round has
   been cleared (the picker pre-fills the submission's round, so an
   untouched publish passes; Fields). On a preprint server: the author
   block (Actors). On a journal the declined refusal comes one step late.
   The publish button first opens "Review Publishing Details", which
   requires, and saves, a Publication Stage and Revision Significance on
   the declined submission before the no-button window appears. A press
   or preprint server opens the refused window directly. <sup>o</sup>
8. **What publishing writes.** Going live stamps the publication date
   (today if the field was empty; a filled date is kept, even a past one),
   fills the empty copyright/license fields from the journal's defaults,
   and assigns a Publication Stage if none was chosen: "Version of Record"
   on a journal or press, "Author Original" on a preprint server, numbered
   as the next major version. It also switches off the Author's edit
   permission on every assignment, permanently, surviving unpublish (that
   lock's story belongs to
   [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md#a4)). On a journal
   or preprint server the reader page goes live at once, whatever the
   version's stage. The submission itself moves to the dashboards'
   published lists (see [My Submissions](U22-my-submissions.md) and
   [Submissions dashboard](U23-submissions-dashboard.md)) only when the
   published version's stage is the final one ⚠ [A3](#a3): "Version of
   Record" on a journal or press, "Author Original" on a preprint server.
   On a press the catalog page waits for that final stage too, so
   publishing a non-final version leaves it down ⚠ [A3](#a3). Scheduling
   performs none of the fills; they run when the item actually goes live.
   <sup>p</sup>
9. **Unpublish and Unschedule are one act with two names.** "Unschedule"
   appears on a scheduled version, "Unpublish" ("Unpost") on a published
   one. Each opens a red confirmation dialog whose confirm button repeats
   the action name. On a journal or press the dialog asks "Are you sure
   you don't want this scheduled for publication?" / "Are you sure you
   don't want this to be published?"; on a preprint server "Are you sure
   you don't want this to be scheduled to be posted?" / "…don't want this
   to be posted?". Confirming sets the version back to Rule 1's
   unpublished readout: "Unscheduled" ("Unposted") on the version readers
   would get, "Unpublished" on any other. The reader page goes down only
   when no published version remains. Unpublishing a later version while
   an earlier one is still published leaves the page live serving that
   earlier version, with its "Versions" list one entry shorter. Everything
   else is KEPT: the publication date, the issue choice {OJS}, the version
   number, the filled copyright fields. <sup>q</sup>
10. **Publishing again re-decides from what was kept.** Because the date
    and issue survive (Rule 9), a re-publish behaves like a first publish
    with those values. A journal article's kept issue choice decides the
    outcome again per Rule 5's table: an article kept as continuous
    publication goes straight live again, its issue still unpublished. A
    press or preprint item whose kept date has meanwhile passed goes
    straight live carrying the ORIGINAL date. <sup>q</sup>
11. **Creating a new version.** "Create New Version" (side menu) opens a
    dialog (Fields). Confirm creates a new version copying the chosen
    version's metadata, contributors, references and files-for-readers
    (galleys on a journal or preprint server, publication formats with
    their chapters on a press), with no publication date and not yet
    published. On a stage-assigned source the dialog arrives pre-answered
    (Fields), so an untouched Confirm yields a minor version of the same
    stage: "Version of Record 1.1", not an unassigned one. The side menu
    gains the version, named by its stage and number ("Version of Record
    2.0"), or "Unassigned version ({date})" when no stage was chosen.
    Readers keep getting the published version until the new one is
    published. Yet the reader page's date line changes at once: the
    unpublished draft's creation day appears as the public "Published"
    date ⚠ [A6](#a6). Nor can a reader reach the draft by address. On a
    journal, a version address naming anything but an OLDER published
    version of the same article (the draft's number, the current version's
    own, a mistyped one) fails with a blank server error rather than a
    "not found" page ⚠ [OJS3](#ojs3). <sup>r</sup>
12. **Version stages and numbering.** A journal and press know three
    stages: Author Original, Published Manuscript Under Review, Version of
    Record. A preprint server knows only Author Original. Numbering is per
    stage: a major revision starts the stage's next whole number ("2.0"),
    a minor one increments behind the dot ("1.1"). "Minor Revision" is
    offered only when the chosen stage already has a version. Switching
    the stage in the dialog silently re-selects "Minor Revision" whenever
    it is allowed, discarding a "Major" pick ⚠ [A4](#a4). Versions are
    never renumbered or deleted by this feature. <sup>s</sup>
13. **Update type and the amendment notice.** The Update Type and Summary
    of Changes save onto the version, and every screen carrying them
    promises the summary "will appear publicly as the version amendment
    notice". But after publishing, no reader page shows it in any app.
    Readers are never told what the version changed ⚠ [A5](#a5).
    <sup>t</sup>
14. **Insert Content {OJS OMP}.** The Summary of Changes box (panel and
    entry page) carries "Insert Content" on the submission-language text
    only. It opens a side panel listing the change summaries authors saved
    with each review revision file, newest first, each labeled
    "Review (Round {n}) • {date} • {file}" ("External Review (Round {n})
    • …" on a press). Choosing one appends its text after whatever the box
    already holds. With none saved it reads "No saved summaries found for
    this submission's review revisions." A preprint server has no review,
    so it has no such button. <sup>u</sup>
15. **A journal with no issues {OJS}.** With not a single issue created,
    the publish flow shows no issue fields at all and publishes
    immediately, without an issue. Scheduling is unreachable. <sup>m</sup>
16. **Send to Text Editor {OJS OMP}.** The action lives on the workflow's
    Production stage, in its "Production Ready Files" list. A file row's
    "More Actions" menu offers "Send to Text Editor" only on files the text
    editor can import (Word, OpenDocument, RTF, LaTeX or Markdown files; a
    PDF row has no such action). It opens the same version dialog, titled
    "Send File to Text Editor", asking "To which version would you like to
    send this file?" ("Create New Version" first, then each existing
    version). What happens to the file afterwards belongs to *JATS & Body
    Text* (no spec yet). <sup>v</sup>
17. **The awaiting-approval notice.** While no version is published, a
    press's Production stage shows the banner "Awaiting approval." with
    "The monograph will not be listed in the catalog until it has been
    published…". Publishing replaces it with two stacked notices: "Status
    / Submission published." and the catalog notice (which belongs to
    *Catalog management*). A journal and preprint server record the same
    approval state internally, but their current workflow screens show no
    such banner. <sup>w</sup>

## Side effects

- **Email "Publication Published"**: sent when a version actually goes
  live (not on scheduling) to every user holding an Author-role assignment
  on the submission ("Your publication, {title}, … has been published.").
  No journal, press or server setting turns it off. Each recipient can
  switch the email off in their own profile's notification settings; that
  does not switch off the task notice. A preprint server sends it too,
  still worded "published" throughout ⚠ [OPS5](#ops5), alongside its own
  acknowledgement below. <sup>x</sup>
- **Task notice for the author**: the same publish files "A new version of
  your submission, "{title}", was published." into each of those users'
  Tasks. Unpublishing removes the notice again. <sup>x</sup>
- **Email "A new version was created for "{title}""**: creating a version
  emails exactly the users with a stage assignment on the submission, the
  submitting author included. The acting editor is among them only when
  they hold such an assignment themselves; a manager acting without one
  gets neither email nor notice. The template nevertheless presents itself
  as a notice to assigned editors ⚠ [A1](#a1). An assigned reviewer gets
  nothing. Each recipient also gets a matching task notice ("A new version
  of a submission was created"). <sup>y</sup>
- **Posted acknowledgements {OPS}**: posting emails the preprint's
  contributors (every listed contributor with an email address, account or
  not). Two templates exist, "Preprint Posted Acknowledgement" for the
  first version and "New Version Posted Acknowledgement" for later ones,
  but every post sends the new-version one. The first-post acknowledgement
  never goes out ⚠ [OPS4](#ops4). The acknowledgement is governed by one
  Workflow › Emails setting (Settings below) and is sent even when the post
  only scheduled the preprint ⚠ [OPS2](#ops2). <sup>z</sup>
- **Activity log**: one line per act. "The submission was published." /
  "…was scheduled for publication." for the first version; "A new version
  was published." / "…scheduled…" for later versions; "The submission was
  unpublished." / "A version was removed from publication."; "A new version
  was created." An unschedule logs the unpublish line ("The submission was
  unpublished."; no unschedule wording exists). A preprint server words
  them with posted/unposted throughout, the scheduling lines included
  ("The submission was scheduled to be posted." / "A new version was
  scheduled to be posted."). <sup>aa</sup>
- **Workflow closes on the final version.** Publishing a Version of Record
  (Author Original on a preprint server) also records the submission's
  workflow as finished. Unpublishing the last one reopens it. The activity
  log shows the move: "{user} moved this submission to the Done stage." /
  "{user} returned this submission to the workflow." <sup>ab</sup>
- **Passed along to other features**: publishing marks DOIs for deposit or
  update (*DOIs*), deposits the work to verified contributors' ORCID
  records (scheduled counts as published for this;
  [ORCID integration](U04-orcid-integration.md)), refreshes the search
  index, and on a press swaps the catalog availability records (*Catalog
  management*). <sup>ac</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

- **Preprint Posted {OPS}**: Settings › Workflow › Emails, "Preprint
  Posted": "Send an email to all authors." / "Do not send an email."
  Sending is the default. When off, neither posted acknowledgement is
  sent. The "Publication Published" email still arrives; this setting does
  not touch it. <sup>z</sup>
- **The journal's issues {OJS}**: which issues exist decides which
  assignment choices the publish flow offers (Rule 5) and whether it offers
  any (Rule 15). Publication fees add their requirement (Rule 7) only once
  fully in force: payments on, a fee amount, and the chosen payment method
  itself completely set up.
- **No switch for the rest.** No journal, press or server setting turns the
  "Publication Published" email off (each recipient can, in their own
  profile; Side effects). Nothing enables author self-posting on a preprint
  server (a plugin hook only; Actors). No setting turns scheduling itself
  on or off in any app. <sup>b</sup>

## Cross-feature interactions

- [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md): owns the metadata
  pages, the edit locks that published/scheduled states impose, and the
  copyright fill's field-level story (its Rule 12). This spec owns the
  publishing acts that trigger them. Its plain-language-summary finding
  surfaces here as the silent Confirm refusal ⚠ [OJS1](#ojs1).
- [Submission stage](U25-submission-stage.md#schedule): the journal's
  Submission-stage "Schedule For Publication" shortcut that lands here.
- *[Workflow screen & stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-access)*:
  who opens the workflow screen and sees the Publication area at all.
- *Issues* (no spec yet): issues themselves. Publishing an issue is what
  releases articles scheduled into it (Rule 5), and unpublishing an issue
  sets its articles back to "Scheduled".
- *Catalog management* (no spec yet): the press's Catalog Entry page,
  add-to-catalog and catalog flags. Its catalog notice replaces the
  awaiting-approval banner (Rule 17).
- *JATS & Body Text* (no spec yet): the "Send to Text Editor" import that
  this feature's version dialog opens (Rule 16).
- [My Submissions](U22-my-submissions.md) /
  [Submissions dashboard](U23-submissions-dashboard.md): the list views a
  publish, schedule or unpublish moves a submission between.
- [ORCID integration](U04-orcid-integration.md): the ORCID publishing
  requirements (Rule 7) and the on-publish deposit.
- *Payments & APCs* (no spec yet): the publication fee whose unpaid state
  blocks a journal's publishing (Rule 7).
- [Submission wizard](U21-submission-wizard.md): the preprint server's
  post-submission texts that tell a submitter whether they can post.

## Canonical scenarios

Scenarios 1–10 and 16 run on the seeded journal with ready accounts and
scratch submissions; scenarios 11–15 run on a scratch journal with
throwaway accounts, because each needs its own issues or a future-dated
item. The publish button and window are labelled per Rule 2; the mail
catcher and each scenario's seeding are in its footnote.

1. **Publish a submission and see it live** — Journal Manager: open an
   unpublished submission's Publication area. The head reads "Status:
   Unscheduled". Press the publish button and complete the flow (on a
   journal: pick "Assign To Current/Back Issue" and an issue in "Review
   Publishing Details", then Confirm). The confirmation window states that
   all requirements are met and names the version to be assigned ("Version
   of Record 1.0" / "Author Original 1.0"). Confirm. The head now reads
   "Status: Published", the reader page is live, the activity log shows
   "The submission was published.", and the submitting author finds the
   "Publication Published" email and a "was published" task notice.
   <sup>s1</sup>
2. **A declined submission cannot be published** — Journal Manager, on a
   declined submission: on a journal the publish button first opens
   "Review Publishing Details" and insists on a Publication Stage and
   Revision Significance. Confirm saves them onto the declined submission
   (Rule 7). A press or preprint server opens the window directly. Either
   way the window lists "A declined submission can not be published."
   ("…posted." on a preprint server) under "The following requirements
   must be met…", and no confirm button is offered. Close; the status is
   unchanged. <sup>s2</sup>
3. **Unpublish** — Journal Manager, on the published submission of
   scenario 1: the Publication area now offers "Unpublish". Pressing it
   asks "Are you sure you don't want this to be published?". Confirm. The
   status returns to "Unscheduled", the reader page is gone, and the log
   adds "The submission was unpublished." The author's task notice from
   scenario 1 is gone too: their Tasks list reads "No Items".
   <sup>s3</sup>
4. **Create a new version** — Journal Manager, on a published
   submission: side menu › "Create New Version". The dialog asks which
   version to copy metadata from, the Publication Stage and the Revision
   Significance; the published version's stage and "Minor Revision" arrive
   preselected. Confirm unchanged. The menu gains "Version of Record 1.1"
   ("Author Original 1.1" on a preprint server), its pages open with
   "Status: Unpublished" and the copied content, and the reader page still
   serves the OLD version, though its date line already shifts
   ⚠ [A6](#a6). The submitting author and the stage-assigned participants
   get the "A new version was created…" email and task notice
   ⚠ [A1](#a1). An assigned reviewer, and a manager acting without a stage
   assignment, get neither. <sup>s4</sup>
5. **Publish the new version** — continue scenario 4: fill an Update
   Type ("Correction") and a Summary of Changes, then publish the new
   version (a journal offers the saved issue choice pre-filled). The
   reader page now serves the new version and its "Versions" list gains
   the new entry. The saved summary appears nowhere on the page
   ⚠ [A5](#a5). The log adds "A new version was published." <sup>s5</sup>
6. **Minor and major numbering** — Journal Manager: create a version in
   the SAME stage as an existing one. "Minor Revision" is selectable and
   yields "… 1.1". Create another choosing a stage with no versions.
   "Minor Revision" is greyed and the result is that stage's "1.0". While
   switching stages, watch the Revision Significance re-select itself
   ⚠ [A4](#a4). <sup>s6</sup>
7. **The version list and the author's view** — the submitting Author
   opens their submission's tracking view (My Submissions). The
   Publication side menu lists every version by name, and each page heads
   with the status readout. No publish, unpublish or Create-New-Version
   control appears anywhere. <sup>s7</sup>
8. **Roles without the controls** — an assigned Section Editor (press:
   Series Editor; preprint server: Moderator) and an assigned Assistant
   {OJS OMP} open the same Publication area. The version pages are there;
   the publish/unpublish buttons and "Create New Version" are not
   ⚠ [A2](#a2). The Production stage view still shows each of them a
   "Schedule For Publication" ("Post the preprint") button. Pressing it
   only lands back on the Publication area, where nothing more is offered.
   <sup>s8</sup>
9. **Unschedule** — Journal Manager, on a scheduled version (journal:
   scenario 11's article; press or preprint server: scenario 14/15's
   future date): the button offered is "Unschedule". It asks "Are you sure
   you don't want this scheduled for publication?" ("Are you sure you
   don't want this to be scheduled to be posted?" on a preprint server).
   Confirm. The status is back to "Status: Unscheduled" ("Unposted").
   <sup>s9</sup>
10. **Republish with what was kept** — Journal Manager: unpublish a
    published item, then press the publish button again. The details
    panel does not reopen {OJS}, because the stage and issue choice
    survived the unpublish (Rules 9, 3). So check the kept issue choice
    {OJS} and publication date on the entry page (Fields) beforehand. The
    button goes straight to the confirmation window, whose text on a
    journal names the kept issue outcome. Confirm. On a press or preprint
    server the item returns to "Published"/"Posted" carrying its ORIGINAL
    date (Rule 10). On a journal the kept issue choice decides again:
    scenario 12's continuous-publication article goes straight back to
    "Published", its issue still unpublished. <sup>s10</sup>

Journal-only. A press and preprint server have no issues; their
scheduling is the date route of scenarios 14 and 15.

11. **Schedule into a future issue** — Journal Manager, on a journal
    with a future issue created AND at least one published issue: on the
    Publication Settings page choose "Assign To Future Issue and Schedule
    Only" plus the issue, and save. Press "Schedule For Publication".
    "Review Publishing Details" opens with the saved choice pre-checked;
    fill the remaining required fields and Confirm. The window promises
    "…published when {issue} is published…" with a "Schedule For
    Publication" button. Confirm. The head reads "Status: Scheduled", the
    reader page stays down, and the dashboards list the article under
    "Scheduled for publication". ⚠ On a journal with NO published issues
    neither route holds: the panel's first "Schedule Only" pick publishes
    immediately, and a choice saved on Publication Settings comes back as
    the immediate-publish choice [OJS2](#ojs2). Change the radio to
    another choice and pick "Schedule Only" again in the panel before
    Confirm to reach the scheduling window. <sup>s11</sup>
12. **Continuous publication warns and publishes** — Journal Manager:
    publish with "Assign To Future Issue and Publish Immediately". The
    window spells out that the article will be published immediately even
    though its issue is not. Confirm. The article is live at once, listed
    with the unpublished issue. Publishing that issue later (an *Issues*
    act) releases any SCHEDULED articles it holds. <sup>s12</sup>
13. **No issues, no choices** — Journal Manager on a scratch journal
    with zero issues: the publish flow shows no Issue Assignment at all
    and publishes the article immediately without an issue (Rule 15).
    <sup>s13</sup>

Press-only.

14. **A future date schedules the book** — Press Manager: on the Catalog
    Entry page set "Date Published" to a future date, save, then press
    Publish. The confirmation still reads "…make this catalog entry
    public?" ⚠ [OMP1](#omp1), but confirming yields "Status: Scheduled".
    The catalog page stays down and the offered controls become "Preview"
    and "Unschedule". The daily background check publishes it once the
    date arrives (Rule 6); that cannot be watched within a test session.
    <sup>s14</sup>

Preprint-server-only.

15. **Post the preprint** — Preprint Server Manager, on a submitted
    preprint: press "Post". The "Post the preprint" window shows the
    requirements met, the version to be assigned ("Author Original 1.0")
    and a "Related Publication" line (on a fresh preprint: "This
    preprint's relations have not been entered."). Confirm. The head reads
    "Status: Posted", the preprint page is live, and the contributors
    receive a posting acknowledgement, mis-titled "New Version Posted
    Acknowledgement" even on this first post ⚠ [OPS4](#ops4). A future
    date saved on Preprint Entry beforehand yields "Status: Scheduled"
    instead, a state nothing will ever post ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1), while the
    acknowledgement is sent anyway ⚠ [OPS2](#ops2). <sup>s15</sup>
16. **The author cannot post** — the submitting Author on a default
    server: the wizard's closing screen says a moderator will review and
    post the preprint (its texts belong to
    [Submission wizard](U21-submission-wizard.md)). The author's workflow
    view offers no Post control ⚠ [OPS3](#ops3). <sup>s16</sup>

### All apps

<a id="a1"></a>
**A1 — Who the new-version email reaches** · ❓ · user-visible.
Creating a version emails "A new version was created for "{title}"" to
every user with a stage assignment on the submission. That includes the
submitting author. The acting editor gets it only through an assignment
of their own; an unassigned acting manager gets nothing. Yet the email's
own description presents it as a notice to assigned editors. An assigned
reviewer gets neither the email nor the task notice. Question: is the
audience meant to be editors only? Lean: yes. The description and the
notice's editorial wording say so; the send filters by assignment, not
role. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a1](#fn-a1)</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — Publishing is managers-only on screen** · ❓ · user-visible.
The publish/unpublish buttons and "Create New Version" appear only for
Journal Managers, Editors and Site Administrators who are not limited to
recommendations. Assigned Section Editors, Guest Editors and Assistants
see none of them. The application's deeper plumbing names those roles for
the same acts, so screen and plumbing disagree about who may publish.
Worse, the Production stage view offers the SAME excluded roles a button
labeled "Schedule For Publication" / "Post the preprint" that is only a
navigation shortcut. Pressed, it lands on a Publication area where they
have nothing to press. On a preprint server the excluded set includes the
Moderator role, the role the submission screens tell authors will "review
and post" their preprint. For a Moderator that dead-end shortcut is the
only Post-labeled control anywhere. Question: is manager-only the intended
narrowing, and is the Moderator exclusion intended on a preprint server?
Lean: the narrowing looks deliberate in the new dashboard, but the
Moderator case contradicts the server's own texts and needs a ruling.
Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe (the absent controls and the dead-end
button, every app; the wider server roster is a code reading).
<sup>[f-a2](#fn-a2)</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — Only a final-stage version counts for the submission** · ❓ ·
user-visible.
The submission's own standing follows its FINAL version stage only. With
just an "Author Original" version published, a journal's article page is
live while the dashboards still list the submission as active or queued.
It joins the "Published" views only once a "Version of Record" is
published. The publish button follows the same rollup: with the article
live it still reads "Schedule For Publication", not "Publish". On a press
BOTH halves wait. With only an "Author Original" version published, the
workflow reads "Status: Published" while the public catalog page stays
down. The author is still emailed "Publication Published" with a link to
a page the public cannot open. On a preprint server Author Original IS
the final stage, so any post counts at once. Question: is a live article
on a submission the lists call unpublished intended? Lean: intended as a
versioning-model design (the lists track the version of record), but the
disagreement between a live reader page and an "active" listing will
surprise editors. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe.
<sup>[f-a3](#fn-a3)</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — The Revision Significance re-decides itself** · ❓ · minor.
In the version dialogs, changing the Publication Stage re-selects "Minor
Revision" whenever a minor version is allowed for the new stage. A user
who chose "Major Revision" and then corrects the stage gets a minor
version unless they notice. The reverse switch, to a stage with no
versions yet, correctly forces "Major Revision" and greys Minor. Only the
switch toward a stage with an existing version discards a choice. A
preprint server knows one stage and offers no switch. Question: should a
stage switch preserve the user's significance choice? Lean: yes. Silently
overriding a made choice is a defect-shaped convenience. Since:
2026-08-29 · Basis: probe.
<sup>[f-a4](#fn-a4)</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — The amendment notice never reaches readers** · 🐞 · user-visible.
Every screen carrying the Summary of Changes promises "This will appear
publicly as the version amendment notice…". Yet a version published with
Update Type "Correction" and a saved summary shows that notice on no
reader page in any app: not the article landing page, not the
per-version pages, not the press's catalog page, not the preprint page.
Readers see a new version appear with no word on what changed, while the
editor believes they published a correction notice. Since: 2026-08-29 ·
Basis: probe (all three apps, default themes).
<sup>[f-a5](#fn-a5)</sup>

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — An unpublished draft rewrites the public dates** · 🐞 ·
user-visible.
Merely creating a new, still unpublished, version changes the live reader
page's date line in every app. It becomes "Published {date} — Updated on
{date}", with the draft's creation day presented as the published date
and the real publication date demoted to "Updated on". Readers still get
the old version, and its "Versions" list shows nothing new. An editor who
quietly starts preparing a revision thereby falsifies the published
record's dates. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe.
<sup>[f-a6](#fn-a6)</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — A requirement-shaped sentence under "all met"** · ❓ · minor.
On a press or preprint server, publishing a version that has no
Publication Stage yet shows "The publication must have a version stage
assigned before it can be published." directly under "All publication
requirements have been met." It is phrased as an unmet requirement,
though it blocks nothing: the confirm button is present and the next line
names the stage that will be assigned. On an already-staged version the
pair collapses to "The publication version is "{version}"". A journal's
details panel assigns the stage first, so its window always shows the
assigned form. Question: should the notice say the stage WILL be assigned
rather than "must be"? Lean: yes. A first-time publisher reads a
contradiction. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe.
<sup>[f-a7](#fn-a7)</sup>

### OJS

<a id="ojs1"></a>
**OJS1 — A required plain language summary blocks Confirm silently** · 🐞 · user-visible.
On a journal that requires a plain language summary, the "Review
Publishing Details" panel's Confirm is refused with no message for a
version without one. Publishing and scheduling are never reached, and
nothing names the missing summary. The requirement's save-blocking side
is [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md#a1)'s finding; a
press and preprint server publish without a summary. Since: 2026-08-28 ·
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-ojs1](#fn-ojs1)</sup>

<a id="ojs2"></a>
**OJS2 — A "Schedule Only" choice is not honored where no issue is published** · 🐞 ·
user-visible.
On a journal with no published issues, where the only issue is a future
one, the "Review Publishing Details" panel opens with no choice
preselected, and the editor's FIRST pick of "Assign To Future Issue and
Schedule Only" is not honored. The confirmation window offers immediate
publication ("…published immediately… Are you sure you want to publish
this?", button "Publish") and confirming yields "Status: Published". The
promised "…published when {issue} is published…" scheduling never
happens. Saving the choice on the Publication Settings page beforehand
fails the same way on that journal: the reloaded settings page and the
panel both come back showing "Assign To Future Issue and Publish
Immediately" checked, and an untouched Confirm offers immediate
publication ("Publish" button). Only changing the radio to another choice
and picking "Schedule Only" again before Confirm produces the correct
scheduling window. With a published or back issue present, the first pick
and a saved choice both behave correctly. The failure is deterministic,
not a timing accident. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe.
<sup>[f-ojs2](#fn-ojs2)</sup>

<a id="ojs3"></a>
**OJS3 — A mistyped version address crashes instead of "not found"** · 🐞 ·
user-visible.
An article's reader page links each OLDER published version at its own
address (the "Versions" list). Typing any other version number into that
address returns a blank server error instead of the "not found" page the
reader should get. That covers a nonexistent number, the current
version's own, an unpublished draft's, and another article's. Because the
list links only older versions, an ordinary mistype or a curious probe of
the current number is enough to hit it. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis:
probe. <sup>[f-ojs3](#fn-ojs3)</sup>

### OMP

<a id="omp1"></a>
**OMP1 — "Make this catalog entry public?" — then it schedules** · ❓ ·
minor.
With a future Date Published saved, the press's publish confirmation
still asks "All publication requirements have been met. Are you sure you
want to make this catalog entry public?". Confirming yields "Status:
Scheduled", not a public entry: the catalog page stays down and the
controls become "Preview" and "Unschedule". Question: should the window
announce the scheduling, as a journal's does? Lean: yes. The journal flow
shows the pattern. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe (the later daily
release itself was not observed; the date lies in the future).
<sup>[f-omp1](#fn-omp1)</sup>

### OPS

<a id="ops1"></a>
**OPS1 — A scheduled preprint is never posted** · 🐞 · user-visible.
Posting a preprint that carries a future date on its Preprint Entry page
sets "Status: Scheduled". The "Post the preprint" window gives no hint of
this; it still asks "…post this?". Nothing ever posts it: the preprint
server runs no scheduled-publications check (a press runs one daily), and
no issue exists whose publication could release it. The preprint waits
until someone unschedules it, clears or passes the date, and posts again.
Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe for the reachable scheduled state
(twice); the never-posts half is a code reading, as no
scheduled-publications task is registered.
<sup>[f-ops1](#fn-ops1)</sup>

<a id="ops2"></a>
**OPS2 — Acknowledged as posted while merely scheduled** · ❓ · minor.
The posted acknowledgement to contributors is sent whenever Post is
confirmed, even when the future date meant the preprint was only
scheduled (OPS1). Authors then read that their preprint is posted while
the public page does not exist. The "Publication Published" email
correctly waits for the actual posting. Question: should the
acknowledgement wait too? Lean: yes; today it announces intent, not
fact. Since: 2026-08-29 · Basis: probe. <sup>[f-ops2](#fn-ops2)</sup>

<a id="ops3"></a>
**OPS3 — Author self-posting has no surface** · ❓ · latent.
A screening plugin can grant authors the right to post their own
preprint, and the server's texts anticipate it: the wizard's closing
screen invites can-post submitters to post. But the author's workflow
view builds no Post button for any author, granted or not, so the grant,
where it exists, has nothing to press. This cannot be verified on a stock
install, because no such plugin ships; it is recorded as the code stands.
Question: where is a granted author meant to post from? Lean: the
invitation text and the plumbing expect a control the current author view
lost. Basis: code. <sup>[f-ops3](#fn-ops3)</sup>

<a id="ops4"></a>
**OPS4 — First-time authors are thanked for "a new version"** · 🐞 ·
user-visible.
Every post sends the contributors "New Version Posted Acknowledgement",
the very first post of a preprint included. A first-time author therefore
reads "Thank you for posting a new version of your preprint… The new
version is now available." The "Preprint Posted Acknowledgement" template
meant for the first post is never sent at all. The acknowledgement body
also ends with a raw "{$signature}" placeholder. Since: 2026-08-29 ·
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-ops4](#fn-ops4)</sup>

<a id="ops5"></a>
**OPS5 — "Posted" and "published" split the same screen** · ❓ · minor.
A preprint server renames the act "Post", yet several surfaces still say
"published". After a post, the submission header's pill reads "Published"
beside a status strip reading "Posted". The author's "Publication
Published" email says their preprint "has been published". Their task
notice reads "A new version of your submission, "{title}", was
published." Question: should the Post vocabulary reach these surfaces
too? Lean: yes. The leftovers read as another application's words. Since:
2026-08-29 · Basis: probe.

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — The gate is computed client-side:
`useWorkflowPermissions.js` sets `canPublish` only when the user's
Production-stage roles intersect `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN | ROLE_ID_MANAGER`
and `currentUserCanRecommendOnly` is false on that stage (the OJS
"Editor" default group carries the manager role level, so it qualifies).
All three `workflowConfigEditorial*.js` return an empty right-hand
control set when `!permissions.canPublish` and gate the side menu's
`publication_create_new_version` item the same way. Server-side the
publish routes admit more (fn-a2).

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — OPS `Repository::canCurrentUserPublish()`: non-authors true;
assigned authors get `(bool) Hook::call('Publication::canAuthorPublish')`
— false with no plugin answering. Enforced as `validatePublish()` error
`authorCheck` → `author.submit.authorsCanNotPublish` ("You can not post
your own preprint. It must be approved and posted by a moderator."). No
context setting exists (`enableAuthorScreening` sits unused in the OPS
context schema). The OPS API re-registers publish/unpublish/version/add
with an author-inclusive role set (`OPSPublishHandler` adds
`ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` to the modal too), but the guard above still refuses.

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — `useWorkflowActions.js`: `workflowUnschedulePublication` and
`workflowUnpublishPublication` both `PUT
…/publications/{id}/unpublish`; only dialog title/message differ
(`publication.unschedule[.confirm]` / `publication.unpublish[.confirm]`),
both warnable, `modalStyle: 'negative'`. Offered per status in
`workflowConfigEditorial*.js` (`STATUS_SCHEDULED` → Unschedule,
`STATUS_PUBLISHED` → Unpublish).

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — Preview: `workflowPreviewPublication` redirects to the
publication's public URL. Guards: OJS queued/ready +
`hasSubmissionPassedStage(…, WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EXTERNAL_REVIEW)`;
OMP/OPS queued + same helper; all apps unconditional on a scheduled
version. On single-stage OPS the passed-stage check is expected true
from the start. Live-probed 2026-08-29: no Preview button anywhere in
the workflow modal of an in-review OJS submission; present on
Production (OJS), Copyediting (OMP), and pre-post and scheduled
versions (OPS) — Preview navigates the same page to the public
`…view/{id}/version/{v}` URL bannered "This is a preview and has not
been published. View submission". The header twin live-probed
2026-08-29: the workflow window's header chrome showed "Preview" to an
assigned Section Editor, an Assistant and the author, and "View" to a
Guest Editor on a published submission — roles the row excludes; that
header button is separate from the publishing-controls Preview the row
records.

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — Side menu item `publication_create_new_version`
(`getPublicationVersionItems` in `useWorkflowNavigationConfig*.js`),
guarded only by `permissions.canPublish`; dispatches
`workflowCreateNewVersion` → `WorkflowVersionDialogBody` mode
`createNewVersion`, title `publication.createVersion`.

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — OJS `IssueEntryForm` (`FORM_ISSUE_ENTRY`), served at
`…/_components/issue`, menu label `publication.publicationSettings`;
OPS ships its own `IssueEntryForm` (no `pages`, no assignment fields)
under the menu label `preprint.entry`. The assignment radio + issue
select + hidden status are injected client-side by
`useWorkflowPublicationFormIssue.js` (guard `formName === 'issue' &&
issueCount > 0 && isOJS()`).

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — `WorkflowPublicationVersionControl.vue` `statusProps`: queued on
the current publication → `publication.status.unscheduled`; scheduled →
`.scheduled`; published → `.published`; everything else (queued on a
non-current version, and OJS's persisted ready-to-publish/-schedule
statuses 6/7) → `.unpublished`. OPS locale: published = "Posted",
unscheduled = "Unposted". Version labels come from the read-only
`versionString` prop. The OMP author view shows the readout too:
`useWorkflowConfigOMP.js` deep-merges the OJS author config, whose
`common` block mounts the version control (live-probed 2026-08-29: the
OMP author's Publication pages head "Status: Unscheduled" —
`workflowConfigAuthorOMP.js` alone defines no `common` block, but the
merge inherits OJS's). OPS wording live-probed 2026-08-29: a
never-posted (and an unposted) reader-facing version reads
"Status: Unposted" for manager, Moderator and author alike, while a
queued NON-current version reads "Unpublished" in all three apps. The
journal's in-between state live-probed 2026-08-29: saving an issue
choice on Publication Settings flipped the readout "Unscheduled" →
"Unpublished", surviving a full page reload. Which version "readers
would get": `PKP\submission\Repository::getCurrentPublicationIdByPublications()`
— the most mature PUBLISHED publication, else the most mature overall,
publications ordered by version stage, then major, then minor
(live-probed 2026-08-29: with v1.0 still published, an unpublished v1.1
read "Unpublished"; v1.1 read "Unscheduled" only after v1.0 was
unpublished too).

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `WorkflowVersionSideModal.vue`, title
`publication.scheduledForPublication.reviewDetails.label` ("Review
Publishing Details"), description `…reviewDetails.description`; hosts
`useWorkflowVersionForm('publish')`. Opened by
`workflowAssignToIssueAndScheduleForPublication` when
`!versionStage || status ∉ [READY_TO_PUBLISH, READY_TO_SCHEDULE]`; its
submit `PUT`s the version fields (+ `issueId`, hidden `status`,
`reviewRoundIds`) onto the publication, then the flow re-enters and
opens the confirmation modal. Publish-mode field roster per
`useWorkflowVersionForm.js`: `versionStage` (required), `versionIsMinor`
(required), `updateType`, `summaryOfChanges`, issue fields (when
`issueCount > 0`), `reviewRoundIds` (on screen "Associated review round", helper "Link
this version to the review round whose findings it reflects. Leave
blank if not applicable.", picker "Select a review round" — live-probed
2026-08-29; the picker arrives pre-filled with the submission's
existing round, "Round 1 — opened {date}", despite the leave-blank
helper). Preselection, live-probed 2026-08-29 (scratch journals):
a settled panel on a version with nothing saved preselects "Assign To
Current/Back Issue" (fn-m's default; journal with a back issue — with
only future issues nothing is preselected and the first pick misfires,
fn-ojs2); a "Schedule Only" choice saved on
Publication Settings arrives pre-checked with its issue, and confirming
it yields the scheduling window and "Status: Scheduled" — on a journal
with a published back issue; with no published issue the saved choice
is not kept (fn-ojs2). Panel-open
traffic is read-only (GETs only) — the first write in the flow is the
Confirm's save, so an early radio click has nothing to race: three
forced-delay attempts produced no error and the early pick survived.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — `useWorkflowVersionForm('createNewVersion')`: `versionSource`
(`publication.versionSource.create.label`), `versionStage` (optional),
`versionIsMinor`; footer `common.confirm`/`common.cancel`; submit `POST
…/publications/{sourceId}/version`. Preselection live-probed 2026-08-29
(OJS, OMP, OPS, stage-assigned sources): the stage select opened on the
copied version's stage ("Version of Record (VoR)" / OPS's sole "Author
Original (AO)") and significance on "Minor Revision"; untouched Confirm
produced "Version of Record 1.1" / "Author Original 1.1". The field was
never observed empty on a stage-assigned source.

<a id="fn-j"></a>
**j** — OJS `IssueEntryForm` groups: placement (`sectionId`,
`categoryIds`), publicationTiming (`datePublished`, description
"…Do not enter a publication date unless the article was previously
published elsewhere and you need to backdate it."), versionAndUpdates
(`updateType`, `summaryOfChanges`), display (`coverImage`, `pages`),
access (`urlPath`). Date format error:
`publication.datePublished.errorFormat`. OPS variant per fn-f; OPS date
guidance: "The posted date will be set automatically when the preprint
is posted…". Labels live-probed 2026-08-29: OJS "Publication Date"
(group "Publication Timing"); the press's Catalog Entry page "Date
Published"; OPS "Date Posted" with description "The posted date will be
set automatically when the preprint is posted. Do not enter a posted
date unless you need to backdate it."

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — Button per `getPrimaryControlsRight`: OJS label
`submission.status === STATUS_PUBLISHED ? publication.publish :
editor.submission.schedulePublication`, action
`WORKFLOW_ASSIGN_TO_ISSUE_AND_SCHEDULE_FOR_PUBLICATION`, statuses
queued/ready; OMP/OPS label `publication.publish` ("Publish"/"Post"),
action `WORKFLOW_SCHEDULE_FOR_PUBLICATION`, status queued only. The
legacy confirmation modal is `modals.publish.PublishHandler` (OPS:
`OPSPublishHandler`, whose only change is admitting authors), title
`editor.submission.schedulePublication` — OPS locale renders that key
"Post the preprint"; the OMP window title, live-probed 2026-08-29, is
"Schedule For Publication" (the same key as OJS). The stage views'
same-labeled button is `getActionItems` in
`workflowConfigEditorial{OJS,OPS}.js`, pushed unconditionally with
`action: 'navigateToMenu'` (fn-a2); OMP inherits the same shortcut
through the editorial-config deep-merge — `useWorkflowConfigOMP.js`
merges the OJS editorial config under OMP's, as it does the author
config (fn-g) — live-probed 2026-08-29: the button renders for a
Series Editor and a press manager. In-review presence live-probed
2026-08-29: an OJS submission in External Review already showed
"Schedule For Publication" in its Publication area (recorded, not
pressed). Residual quirk, live-probed 2026-08-29 (reproduced twice on a
scratch journal): the FIRST press of "Schedule For Publication" is
occasionally swallowed — nothing opens and no request fires until a
second press.

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — `publish.tpl`: `$publishWarnings` list under
`publication.publish.warning`, then the app `PublishForm` — a
confirmation-only form (`FieldHTML`). With `$requirementErrors` the page
is added WITHOUT a submit button (`publication.publish.requirements`).
Warnings come only from the `Publication::validatePublishWarnings` hook
(core adds none). Confirmation strings: OJS
`publication.publish.confirmation[.backIssue|.continuousPublication|.issueLess|.futureIssue]`
(the future-issue branch relabels the submit
`editor.submission.schedulePublication`); OMP `…confirmation` ("…make
this catalog entry public?"); OPS "…post this?" plus the
related-publication table (`publication.publish.relationStatus.*`). All
three append the version-stage sentence
(`publication.required.versionStage[.assignment|.alreadyAssignment]`).
Live-probed 2026-08-29: the OPS window opens "All requirements have
been met." (no "publication") and its refusal heading reads "The
following requirements must be met before this can be posted." with "A
declined submission can not be posted."; A7's requirement-shaped stage
sentence ("The publication must have a version stage assigned before it
can be published.", then "The stage version that will be assigned to
the publication is "{version}"") was recorded on OMP and OPS first
publishes of stage-less versions, and collapsed to "The publication
version is "{version}"" on republish (fn-a7).
OJS1: with `plainLanguageSummary` required the panel's own save is
refused before the modal is ever reached (see the metadata spec's A1
evidence, live-probed 2026-08-28).

<a id="fn-m"></a>
**m** — `IssueAssignment` enum: NO_ISSUE/FUTURE_ISSUES_PUBLISHED →
`STATUS_READY_TO_PUBLISH`; FUTURE_ISSUE_SCHEDULED →
`STATUS_READY_TO_SCHEDULE`; CURRENT_BACK_ISSUES_PUBLISHED →
`STATUS_READY_TO_PUBLISH`; options filtered by which issues exist
(`getAvailableAssignmentOption`); default when nothing saved:
current/back issue if any issue exists, else no-issue — a default that
misfires when only future issues exist (fn-ojs2). OJS
`setStatusOnPublish()`: ready-to-publish → published (+ today if no
date), ready-to-schedule → scheduled; legacy fallback keys on the
issue's published flag. Release of scheduled articles:
`IssueGridHandler::publishIssue()` publishes every scheduled publication
of the issue; `unpublishIssue()` returns published ones to scheduled.
Zero-issue journals: the version form skips the issue fields and submits
publish-now (`issueId: null` + ready-to-publish). Live-probed 2026-08-29
(scratch journals): all four confirmation sentences appeared verbatim
per Rule 5's table with the matching buttons (the schedule-only
branch's "Schedule For Publication", the other three "Publish"); the
zero-issue journal showed no issue fields at all and published
issueless. Friction: the panel's description still says "…confirm the
issue it belongs to…" on a zero-issue journal.

<a id="fn-n"></a>
**n** — OMP/OPS `setStatusOnPublish()`: future `datePublished` →
`STATUS_SCHEDULED`, else `STATUS_PUBLISHED` (+ stamp now if empty). The
daily check is `PKP\task\PublishSubmissions` — registered in the OMP
scheduler only (`Scheduler.php` per app: OJS registers other tasks, OPS
only usage stats). It publishes the current publication of scheduled
submissions whose date has arrived.

<a id="fn-o"></a>
**o** — `validatePublish()`: shared — `publication.required.declined`,
ORCID `orcid.verify.duplicateOrcidAuthor` /
`orcid.verify.hasUnauthenticatedOrcid` (when ORCID enabled); OJS —
`publication.invalidIssue`,
`editor.article.payment.publicationFeeNotPaid` (when publication fees
enabled), `publication.required.pmurReview`; OMP — no additions
(positive evidence of shared behavior); OPS — `authorCheck` (fn-b).
Errors return as HTTP 400 to the confirmation form. Declined refusal
live-probed 2026-08-29 in all three apps; on OJS the "Review Publishing
Details" panel opened first and required Publication Stage + Revision
Significance (an empty Confirm marks both "This field is required.";
the filled values are saved onto the declined submission) before the
no-button window appeared; OMP and OPS opened the refused window
directly. The ORCID refusal live-probed 2026-08-29 on all three apps
(scratch journal, press and preprint server, each with a contributor
carrying an unauthenticated iD): the window listed "Unauthenticated
ORCiDs for contributors detected." with no confirm button; the
duplicate-iD case was not probed. The dangling-issue refusal ("The
issue for this publication could not be found.") was not reachable
through the screens — live-probed 2026-08-29: deleting the assigned
(unconfirmed) issue reverted the version to "Unscheduled" and the next
publish press re-opened the panel with re-filtered choices, so the
state never survived to the check; the requirement stands on the code
reading. The fee requirement did not arm on payments enabled + an APC
of 100 + "Manual Fee Payment" selected (live 2026-08-29, window still
all-met): `publicationEnabled()` additionally requires the chosen
payment plugin's own `isConfigured()` — ManualPayment demands its
payment-instructions text. The PMUR refusal
live-probed 2026-08-29 (the round deselected and saved empty
beforehand): "A PMUR version cannot be published without an associated
review round. Please assign a review round to this publication version
before proceeding." — no confirm button; with the pre-filled round
left untouched the PMUR publish went through.

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — `Repository::publish()`: status via `setStatusOnPublish`;
copyright/license back-fill only when the result is PUBLISHED; version
auto-assignment via `getNextAvailableVersion(…,
Publication::DEFAULT_VERSION_STAGE, false)` (OJS/OMP `VERSION_OF_RECORD`,
OPS `AUTHOR_ORIGINAL`). Author lock: the API controller
(`publishPublication`) sets `canChangeMetadata = 0` on every author
stage assignment after publishing — not restored on unpublish, and not
applied when the daily task publishes. Submission rollup:
`getStatusByPublications()` counts only versions whose stage equals
`VersionStage::finalVersionStage()` (A3). Live 2026-08-29 (OPS
controls): posting filled the empty copyright holder/year from the
server's defaults; the author's Save stayed disabled after unpost (the
lock survives); a future-date post that only scheduled left the
copyright fields empty (scheduling performs no fills). The stage
auto-assign is never exercised through the OJS screens — the journal's
details panel demands a stage before any UI publish — while a press or
preprint server exercises it live on every first stage-less publish
(fn-a7).

<a id="fn-q"></a>
**q** — `Repository::unpublish()` sets only `status = STATUS_QUEUED`;
`datePublished`, `issueId`, version numbers and the filled permission
fields are untouched; `updateStatus()` + `updateCurrentPublication()`
recompute the submission. The API refuses unless the status was
PUBLISHED or SCHEDULED (`api.publication.403.alreadyUnpublished`), which
is why one endpoint serves both dialogs (fn-c). Republish outcomes
follow `setStatusOnPublish` re-run on the kept data — live-probed
2026-08-29: an OJS continuous-publication article, unpublished while its
issue was still unpublished, reopened the panel with the kept choice
pre-checked and republished straight to "Published" through the same
confirmation window. OPS unpost dialog live-probed 2026-08-29: heading
"Unpost", message "Are you sure you don't want this to be posted?",
buttons Unpost/Cancel; the readout returned to "Unposted". OPS
unschedule dialog live-probed 2026-08-29: heading "Unschedule",
message "Are you sure you don't want this to be scheduled to be
posted?", buttons Unschedule/Cancel, red — the OPS locale overrides
the journal wording (`publication.unschedule.confirm`). Full
unpublish–republish cycles driven 2026-08-29 on OMP and OPS as well:
the public page returned 404 after every unpublish/unpost (all three
apps, single published version), and the republished item carried its
ORIGINAL date unchanged — no restamping. Multi-version unpublish
live-probed 2026-08-29 (OJS): unpublishing v1.1 while v1.0 stayed
published left the v1.1 page reading "Status: Unpublished" and the
article page live (HTTP 200) serving v1.0, its "Versions" list one
entry shorter; the page went 404 only after the last published version
was unpublished.

<a id="fn-r"></a>
**r** — `Repository::version()`: clone with `datePublished = null`,
`status = QUEUED`, `sourcePublicationId` set; copies citations, authors
(remapping the primary contact), data citations, non-default JATS file,
publication media; per app adds galleys (OJS/OPS) or publication
formats + chapters + chapter authors (OMP). `currentPublicationId`
(what readers get) = the last published publication, else the most
mature of any status — so an unpublished new version does not replace
the published one publicly, though it may become the workflow's shown
default. Email/notice are sent by the API layer only
(`createNewPublicationVersionAndNotify`).

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — `VersionStage` enum per app: OJS/OMP AO/PMUR/VoR (order 1/2/3,
final VoR); OPS AO only (final AO). Numbering:
`getNextAvailableVersion()` per stage, `++minor` or `++major`+`.0`;
display `publication.versionStage.display` "{stage} {major}.{minor}",
unassigned label `publication.versionStage.unassignedVersion`. Minor
availability: `allowMinorVersion = some publication already in the
chosen stage`; the auto-reselect quirk (A4) is
`updateMinorOptionAvailability()` passing the availability itself as
the field's new value on every stage change.

<a id="fn-t"></a>
**t** — `updateType` (12 values, default New Version) and
`summaryOfChanges` are stored on the publication;
`publication.summaryOfChanges.description`: "This will appear publicly
as the version amendment notice…". Rendering evidence: fn-a5.

<a id="fn-u"></a>
**u** — `useInsertSummaryOfChangesContent.js` adds the TinyMCE button on
the primary-locale editor only; `InsertSummaryOfChangesModal.vue`
(title `common.insertContent`) lists the `summaryOfChanges` texts saved
on review-revision files (OMP adds internal-review revisions), empty
state `publication.insertContent.empty`; insert APPENDS. Wired for the
OJS issue form / version form and the OMP catalogEntry form
(`(formName === 'issue' && isOJS()) || (formName === 'catalogEntry' &&
isOMP())`); skipped on OPS. Live-probed 2026-08-29 (scratch contexts,
two-locale forms): exactly one "Insert Content" button per page — the
submission-language box only; the empty message verbatim; entries read
"Review (Round 1) • 2026-08-29 • article.pdf" (OJS) / "External Review
(Round 1) • 2026-08-29 • article.pdf" (OMP); Insert appended the saved
summary after prefilled text, the other locale's box untouched; the OPS
Preprint entry page carried no such button on either box. The list is
fed by the author's revision-upload wizard, whose details step carries
the same "Summary of Changes (Amendment Notice)" field.

<a id="fn-v"></a>
**v** — `WorkflowVersionDialogBody.vue` accepts modes
`createNewVersion` and `sendToTextEditor` only; text-editor mode adds
the required `sendToVersion` select
(`publication.sendToTextEditor.label`) whose first option is "Create New
Version", then navigates to Body Text with the import parameters.
Live-probed 2026-08-29 (OJS Production Ready Files): the row's "More
Actions" menu offers "Send to Text Editor" only for pandoc-importable
extensions (`useFileManagerConfig.js` `PANDOC_IMPORT_EXTENSIONS`: docx,
odt, rtf, tex, latex, md, markdown — no action on a PDF); the dialog is
titled "Send File to Text Editor" and, on OJS, opens preselecting
"Create New Version". The OMP dialog's picker rendered with no
selection at all (live-probed 2026-08-29, confirmed visually) — hence
the rule claims the option's position, not a preselection. The OPS
workflow mounts no file manager at all (live-probed 2026-08-29: the
Production stage view's panels are Discussions and Participants only;
zero FileManager components in the OPS workflow configs) — hence the
rule's {OJS OMP} marker.

<a id="fn-w"></a>
**w** — `PKPApproveSubmissionNotificationManager::updateNotification()`
writes/clears the approve-submission and format-needs-approval notices
around the published state; the Vue workflow banner requests them on
OMP's Production stage only (OJS asks for its production-user/galley
notices instead; the OJS/OPS texts exist but nothing displays them —
"This submission is currently awaiting approval…" per-app wordings in
each app's locale). OJS/OPS refresh these records only on submission
completion; OMP also on publish/unpublish. Live-probed 2026-08-29: the
OMP banner read "Awaiting approval." / "The monograph will not be
listed in the catalog until it has been published. To add this book to
the catalog, click on the Publication tab.", replaced after publish by
"Status / Submission published." plus a "Catalog Management" notice;
OJS and OPS showed no approval banner before or after (OJS gains only
the "Status / Submission published." notice).

<a id="fn-x"></a>
**x** — `NotifyAuthorOnPublication` (shared listener, all three apps —
the mailable merely isn't listed among OPS's configurable emails):
recipients = users with author-role stage assignments; creates the
`PUBLICATION_PUBLISHED` task notice, then the email
(`AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_PUBLISHED`, subject "Publication Published")
unless the user opted out of that notification's emails
(profile notifications settings). The opt-out live-probed 2026-08-29,
both directions (OJS, recipient-scoped Mailpit): Profile ›
Notifications › Submission Events row "A new version of your
submission, "Title", was published." (email checkbox
`emailNotificationPublicationPublished`) — with the opt-out saved, the
next publish delivered NO email while the task notice still arrived; a
control publish without it delivered both. Settings › Workflow ›
Emails carries no switch for this mailable (full-tab check, OJS and
OMP). Runs only when the status became PUBLISHED. The handler's unpublish branch deletes the task notice again
— it runs live although `subscribe()` registers only the published
event (live-probed 2026-08-29, all three apps: after unpublish/unpost
the author's Tasks grid reads "No Items"; twice-reproduced on OJS, the
notification row gone within seconds). Notice text:
`notification.type.publicationPublished`. The OPS send live-probed
2026-08-29 (scratch server, recipient-scoped Mailpit): the author
received subject "Publication Published" on a first post; wording
evidence at fn-ops5.

<a id="fn-y"></a>
**y** — `createNewPublicationVersionAndNotify()`: for every user
`assignedTo(submission)` — STAGE assignments, so review assignments are
outside the set — creates the `SUBMISSION_NEW_VERSION` task notice and
sends `PublicationVersionNotify` (key `VERSION_CREATED`, subject
`emails.versionCreated.subject`); no role filter despite
`toRoleIds = [SUB_EDITOR]` and the description
`mailable.publicationVersionNotify.description` ("…notifies assigned
editors…") (A1). Versions created by any other path notify nobody.

<a id="fn-z"></a>
**z** — `SendPostedAcknowledgement` (OPS listener): gate
`postedAcknowledgement` context setting (default on; Settings ›
Workflow › Emails group "Preprint Posted", options live-probed
2026-08-29: "Send an email to all authors." / "Do not send an email."); meant to send `PostedAcknowledgement` (key `POSTED_ACK`)
for version 1 and `PostedNewVersionAcknowledgement`
(`POSTED_NEW_VERSION_ACK`) otherwise, but the version check is dead —
every post sends the new-version mailable (fn-ops4); recipients = the
publication's contributor records with an email. No
published-vs-scheduled check (OPS2). Setting flip live-probed
2026-08-29 (scratch server, recipient-scoped Mailpit): with "Do not
send an email." saved, a first post and a later-version post each
delivered "Publication Published" and neither acknowledgement;
same-window posts with the setting on delivered both (positive
controls). That the first-version template also leaves the
configurable-emails list when the setting is off is a code reading,
not re-checked live.

<a id="fn-aa"></a>
**aa** — Event log: `SUBMISSION_LOG_METADATA_PUBLISH` with
`publication.event.published` / `.scheduled` (first publication) or
`.versionPublished` / `.versionScheduled` (submission has more than one
version, unpublished drafts counted), `…_UNPUBLISH` with
`.unpublished` / `.versionUnpublished`, `…_CREATE_VERSION` with
`.versionCreated`. OPS wordings: "The submission was posted.", "This
version was unposted and is no longer publicly available.", etc.
Live-probed 2026-08-29 across the acts (publish, version publish,
unpublish, version creation; full cycles on OMP and OPS): the lines
appeared as listed, the OPS log worded posted/unposted. The OPS
scheduled-line wordings are the locale's (`publication.event.scheduled`
"The submission was scheduled to be posted.", `…versionScheduled` "A
new version was scheduled to be posted.") — the scheduled log line
itself was not driven live. Unscheduling
live-probed 2026-08-29 (OJS, single-version submission): the log
gained "The submission was unpublished." — no unschedule-specific
line exists in the wording family.

<a id="fn-ab"></a>
**ab** — `ApplyDoneWorkflowStage` listener (publish and unpublish):
records a move-to-done decision when a published final-stage version
exists, and a return-to-workflow decision when the count drops to zero.
Live-probed 2026-08-29: the activity log read "Mira Manager moved this
submission to the Done stage." after a final-stage publish and
"…returned this submission to the workflow." after unpublishing it;
the same pair observed on a preprint server around a post/unpost cycle
(Author Original being the final stage there).

<a id="fn-ac"></a>
**ac** — Listeners on the publish event: `VersionDois` (DOI creation),
`SendSubmissionToOrcid` (deposits when status is published OR
scheduled), `UpdateSubmissionInSearchIndex` (also on unpublish). OMP
`publish()`/`unpublish()` overrides additionally swap
publication-format tombstones and refresh the approval notices; OJS
reconciles article tombstones (OAI). DOI details: DOI versioning
clears/keeps version DOIs per app rules — the DOI feature's story.

<a id="fn-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — Send loop over `Repo::user()->getCollector()
->assignedTo($submissionId)` with no role filter
(`createNewPublicationVersionAndNotify`); the collector matches stage
assignments, which a review assignment is not. Live-probed 2026-08-29
(scratch journal + press, recipient-scoped Mailpit): the submitting
author and the stage-assigned participants received the email and the
task notice; the assigned, accepted reviewer received neither; the
acting manager holding NO stage assignment received nothing either
(OJS and OMP, same-window positive controls); the OPS
author receipt confirmed on a scratch server. Rider: the author's copy
links to the editorial dashboard URL
(`…/dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}`), not My
Submissions.

<a id="fn-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — UI gate fn-a vs server rosters: the publish API routes and
the legacy modal admit `SUB_EDITOR` and `ASSISTANT` (`SITE_ADMIN` on
the modal), and the OPS variants add `AUTHOR`; only the client-side
`canPublish` narrows to managers. The screens never offer the act, so
only the offer's absence is probe-able; the roster mismatch itself is a
code observation. OPS Moderator = the sub-editor slot
(glossary Part II), hence no Post button by the same gate. Live-probed
2026-08-29: assigned deciding and recommend-only Section Editors, a
Series Editor, Layout Editors (Assistant), the OPS Moderator and
submitting authors all lacked the top-right buttons (the container
absent from the DOM) and the "Create New Version" item, while every
version page and the status readout rendered. The stage views'
"Schedule For Publication" / "Post the preprint" button
(`getActionItems`, `action: 'navigateToMenu'`, no permission gate) was
pressed live as a Section Editor (OJS) and as the Moderator (OPS): the
page moved to the Publication area's "Title & Abstract", no dialog
opened, and no publish controls appeared.

<a id="fn-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — `getStatusByPublications()` requires a published/scheduled
publication whose `versionStage === finalVersionStage()` (VoR; OPS AO)
to move the submission to published/scheduled; `currentPublicationId`
(the reader-facing version) has no such filter — hence a live page on a
"queued" submission. Live-probed 2026-08-29 (scratch journal): with only
"Author Original 1.0" published the article page returned 200 while the
editor dashboard kept the submission under "Assigned to me" / "Active
submissions" (Published count unmoved) and the author's My Submissions
read "Published 0"; the top-right button still read "Schedule For
Publication". Publishing a "Version of Record 1.0" moved it to
"Published" on both dashboards. OPS control: a first post (Author
Original being final there) flipped both dashboards at once. OMP: the
public catalog page is gated on the SUBMISSION's published status
(`CatalogBookHandler`), unlike OJS's article page which serves any
published publication — live-probed 2026-08-29 (scratch press): with
only "Author Original 1.0" published the strip read "Status:
Published" while the anonymous catalog page returned 404, and the
author's "Publication Published" email was delivered regardless.

<a id="fn-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — `updateMinorOptionAvailability()` sets the field's
`currentValue` to the availability boolean on every stage change and
clears its error. Live-probed 2026-08-29 (OJS create dialog; the shared
dialog also exercised on OMP and OPS): with "Version of Record" chosen
and "Major Revision" picked, switching to the empty "Author Original"
stage kept Major and greyed Minor; switching back to "Version of
Record" re-selected "Minor Revision" by itself, discarding the Major
pick. The same auto-switch fires in the journal's publishing panel.
Numbering: a minor version on an existing stage produced "Version of
Record 1.1"; an empty stage produced that stage's "1.0".

<a id="fn-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — Live-probed 2026-08-29, all three apps (default themes,
scratch contexts): Update Type "Correction" and a summary ("U49D
correction notice…") saved and re-checked as persisted, version
published; the full page HTML of the article landing page, both
per-version URLs, the press's catalog page and the preprint page
contained neither the summary text nor the word "Correction". The
promise is `publication.summaryOfChanges.description` ("This will
appear publicly as the version amendment notice. Ensure it accurately
reflects the changes made in this version before publishing."), shown
on the panel and every entry page.

<a id="fn-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — Live-probed 2026-08-29, all three apps (scratch contexts):
an OJS article published 2026-08-28 read "Published 2026-08-28" before,
and "Published 2026-08-29 — Updated on 2026-08-28" immediately after a
new version was created and left unpublished — the page otherwise
unchanged (old content, "Versions" list still one entry). The press's
catalog page and the preprint page grew the same "Updated on" line
("Published August 29, 2026 — Updated on August 29, 2026" / "Posted
2026-08-29 — Updated on 2026-08-29"); same-day dates masked the
inversion there.

<a id="fn-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — Live-probed 2026-08-29 (scratch press + preprint server):
first publish of a stage-less version — OMP window "All publication
requirements have been met. Are you sure you want to make this catalog
entry public?" / "The publication must have a version stage assigned
before it can be published." / "The stage version that will be assigned
to the publication is "Version of Record 1.0"", Publish button present
and working; OPS identical in shape ("Author Original 1.0", button
"Post"). Republishing the now-staged version collapsed the two
sentences to "The publication version is "Version of Record 1.0"".
Strings: `publication.required.versionStage[.assignment|.alreadyAssignment]`.

<a id="fn-ojs1"></a>
**f-ojs1** — Live 2026-08-28 (metadata spec, register A1): with
"Require the author to provide a plain language summary…" on, the
panel's Confirm was refused with no message on a summary-less version;
OMP published and OPS posted under the same requirement. The
requirement is checked against what each save sends; the panel's save
does not carry the summary field.

<a id="fn-ojs2"></a>
**f-ojs2** — `getIssueAssignmentStatus()` returns the default
`CURRENT_BACK_ISSUES_PUBLISHED` + `STATUS_READY_TO_PUBLISH` whenever
ANY issue exists (`IssueAssignment::defaultAssignment`);
`useWorkflowPublicationFormIssue.js` writes that hidden status into the
form. With no published issues the default names an option the panel
does not offer, so `currentAssignmentOption` stays null, the
`isInitialDataLoad` slot is never consumed, and the user's first pick
takes the initial-load branch and skips `setHiddenValue('status', …)` —
the Confirm submits still carrying the default ready-to-publish status.
With a published or back issue present the default is offered and
preselected, the initial-load slot is consumed on open, and every pick
writes its status (code reading). Live-probed 2026-08-29, twice, with
a settled status fetch before the pick (deterministic, not timing): on
a journal whose only issue was a future one, the first "Schedule Only"
pick's window read "…published immediately… Are you sure you want to
publish this?" with button "Publish" and confirming yielded "Status:
Published"; changing the radio a second time before Confirm produced
the "…published when {issue} is published…" window and
"Status: Scheduled". The Publication-Settings-first route live-probed
2026-08-29 on the same journal shape (the same defaulting mechanism):
saving "Assign To Future Issue and Schedule Only" stored the default
ready-to-publish state instead — the reloaded settings page and the
panel both came back with "Assign To Future Issue and Publish
Immediately" checked, and an untouched Confirm offered the
continuous-publication window with a "Publish" button. On a journal
with a published back issue the saved choice arrived pre-checked and
confirmed into "Status: Scheduled" (fn-h).

<a id="fn-ojs3"></a>
**f-ojs3** — Live-probed 2026-08-29: `GET
…/article/view/{id}/version/{publicationId}` returned HTTP 500 with an
empty body for a nonexistent publication id, another submission's
publication id and an unpublished draft's id alike; only an OLDER
published version of the same article renders (the current version has
no version link of its own). Server error log: `PHP Fatal error:
Uncaught Error: Typed property
APP\pages\article\ArticleHandler::$publication must not be accessed
before initialization` — `ArticleHandler`'s `if (!$this->publication)`
guard reads the typed property before it was ever assigned, so the
intended not-found response is unreachable. Empty body, no disclosure —
a robustness bug, nothing security-shaped.

<a id="fn-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — OMP `PublishForm` shows the single confirmation string for
every date; `setStatusOnPublish()` decides scheduled-vs-published only
after Confirm. Live-probed 2026-08-29 (scratch press): "Date Published"
saved as 2027-03-01, the Publish window verbatim unchanged ("…make this
catalog entry public?"); confirming returned "Status: Scheduled" with
controls Preview and Unschedule, and the anonymous catalog page stayed
404. The daily release itself was not observed (future date) — it rests
on the registered task (fn-n).

<a id="fn-ops1"></a>
**f-ops1** — OPS `setStatusOnPublish()` schedules on a future date, but
the OPS scheduler registers no publish task (fn-n) and OPS has no
issue-publish release path. The scheduled state live-probed 2026-08-29,
twice (scratch servers): "Date Posted" saved as a future date, the
"Post the preprint" window unchanged from the immediate-post one,
confirm → "Status: Scheduled" with controls Preview and Unschedule, the
anonymous preprint page 404. The never-posts claim rests on the absent
task registration.

<a id="fn-ops2"></a>
**f-ops2** — `SendPostedAcknowledgement` runs on the publish event with
no status filter (fn-z), unlike `NotifyAuthorOnPublication` which
checks for the published status. Live-probed 2026-08-29
(recipient-scoped Mailpit): the scheduling post delivered the
acknowledgement while "Publication Published" correctly did not arrive
for it.

<a id="fn-ops3"></a>
**f-ops3** — `workflowConfigAuthorOPS.js` builds
`getPrimaryControlsLeft` only (status readout + relation dropdown); no
author config produces publish controls, and `canPublish` (fn-a)
excludes authors regardless of the hook. The wizard-side texts are the
submission wizard spec's (its OPS complete-screen footnotes,
live-probed 2026-08-25).

<a id="fn-ops4"></a>
**f-ops4** — `SendPostedAcknowledgement::handle()` picks the mailable
by `$publication->getData('version') == 1`, but the publication schema
keeps only `versionMajor`/`versionMinor`/`versionStage`/`versionString`
(the `version` column is gone; this listener is the datum's only
consumer), so the check is always false and the `PostedAcknowledgement`
branch is unreachable. Live-probed 2026-08-29: five first posts across
three scratch servers all delivered subject "New Version Posted
Acknowledgement" with body "…Thank you for posting a new version of
your preprint… The new version is now available. If you have any
questions, please contact me.{$signature}" — the "{$signature}"
rendered raw; "Preprint Posted Acknowledgement" appeared in no mailbox
(recipient-scoped Mailpit).

<a id="fn-ops5"></a>
**f-ops5** — Live-probed 2026-08-29 (scratch server): after a post the
submission header pill read "Published" while the controls strip read
"Status: Posted"; the author's mail arrived as subject "Publication
Published", body "…has been published."; the author's Tasks row read "A
new version of your submission, "{title}", was published." — the OPS
locale does not override these (`NotifyAuthorOnPublication`'s mailable
and `notification.type.publicationPublished` render the shared
wording).

<a id="fn-s1"></a>
**s1 — scenario 1 seeding.** A scratch submission moved to Production
(any app); OJS needs a published or future issue for the "Current/Back
Issue" pick — use a scratch back issue. Watch Mailpit for the author's
"Publication Published"; the task notice is under the bell/Tasks. OPS:
the button is "Post", the window "Post the preprint", the resulting
status "Posted".

<a id="fn-s2"></a>
**s2 — scenario 2 seeding.** Decline a scratch submission (journal/press:
Decline Submission while queued; preprint server: Decline on the
Production stage), then open the Publication area as manager and press
the publish button (on the journal, fill the panel's required stage and
significance to reach the refusal — Rule 7's late refusal, live-probed
2026-08-29).

<a id="fn-s3"></a>
**s3 — scenario 3 seeding.** Scenario 1's published submission; check
the author's Tasks after confirming the unpublish.

<a id="fn-s4"></a>
**s4 — scenario 4 seeding.** A published scratch submission with an
assigned reviewer left on it (for A1's recipient check) on OJS/OMP; on
OPS any posted preprint.

<a id="fn-s5"></a>
**s5 — scenario 5 seeding.** Scenario 4's new version; the
amendment-notice absence (A5) is asserted against the full page HTML,
not just the visible text.

<a id="fn-s6"></a>
**s6 — scenario 6 seeding.** A submission with one "Version of Record"
(journal/press) or "Author Original" (preprint server) version
published; create versions choosing same-stage and new-stage options.
OPS has a single stage — its leg covers only the minor/major numbering.

<a id="fn-s7"></a>
**s7 — scenario 7 seeding.** A roster Author's own submission with two
versions (one published); open via My Submissions.

<a id="fn-s8"></a>
**s8 — scenario 8 seeding.** Assign the Section Editor / Series Editor /
Moderator and (OJS/OMP) an Assistant to the Production stage of an
unpublished scratch submission; record the Publication area's controls
for each, and press the Production stage view's "Schedule For
Publication" / "Post the preprint" button once per role (it navigates
only — fn-a2). Cross-app control for the exclusivity claim in Actors.

<a id="fn-s9"></a>
**s9 — scenario 9 seeding.** Journal: scenario 11's scheduled article.
Press/preprint server: scenario 14/15's future-dated item.

<a id="fn-s10"></a>
**s10 — scenario 10 seeding.** OMP/OPS: publish/post normally, wait for
the stamped date to be in the past (immediate), unpublish, republish.
OJS: scenario 12's continuous-publication article — unpublish it while
its issue is still unpublished, then republish (live-probed 2026-08-29:
back to "Published" at once through the same continuous-publication
confirmation).

<a id="fn-s11"></a>
**s11 — scenario 11 seeding.** Scratch journal with a future issue
(Issues › Future Issues › Create Issue) AND a published back issue —
on that shape the settings-first route works (live-probed 2026-08-29:
the saved choice arrived pre-checked and confirmed into
"Status: Scheduled") and a direct panel pick registers normally. The
⚠ rider's journal shape is the same journal WITHOUT a published
issue — there both the first panel pick and the settings-saved choice
misfire, and only the re-pick choreography schedules (fn-ojs2).

<a id="fn-s12"></a>
**s12 — scenario 12 seeding.** Same future issue; second scratch
submission. The issue-publish leg drives Issues › Future Issues ›
Publish Issue and then re-checks the scheduled article of scenario 11.

<a id="fn-s13"></a>
**s13 — scenario 13 seeding.** A brand-new scratch journal with no
issues created and one production-ready submission.

<a id="fn-s14"></a>
**s14 — scenario 14 seeding.** Scratch press; Catalog Entry page (the
catalog feature's surface, used here as the date's home), date e.g.
one year ahead.

<a id="fn-s15"></a>
**s15 — scenario 15 seeding.** Scratch preprint server (default
settings — "Preprint Posted" on); a submitted preprint. The future-date
leg uses a second preprint with the date saved on Preprint Entry before
posting.

<a id="fn-s16"></a>
**s16 — scenario 16 seeding.** A roster Author's freshly submitted
preprint on a stock server; the wizard's closing screen plus the
author's workflow view.

Scope notes: API-065's `relate` operation (preprint relations) is OUT OF
SCOPE per the campaign scope ruling — only its author-inclusive
re-registrations of the publish/version routes are claimed here.
API-057's `submissionPayment` component is cited by *Payments & APCs*
(rider). AFFW-424's `catalogEntry` half and NOTIF-037's OMP
format-approval surface belong to *Catalog management* (riders); the
publish/versions endpoint cluster of the omnibus submissions controller
is homed at
*[Workflow screen & stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md)*
(rider both ways).
