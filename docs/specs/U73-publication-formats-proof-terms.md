# Publication formats & proof terms {OMP}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

A press offers each book in one or more **publication formats**: a PDF
or EPUB edition, a printed paperback or hardback, or a copy hosted on
another website. Press staff build a version's formats on its
"Publication Formats" page: each format gets a name, a kind from the
book trade's list (such as "Paperback / softback (BC)"), a physical or
digital flag, and either files readers download from the press's site
or the address of the remote copy. Each file of a format (a **format
file**; the windows call it a "proof") carries **terms**: "Open Access"
(free), "Direct Sales" (at a price) or "Not Available". "Format
Approval" approves the format's catalog data and "Format Availability"
makes the format available to readers; these two decide what the book's
page shows. "Approve Proof" marks a format file approved, which changes
nothing readers get [A10](#a10). Each format also carries catalog data
for the book trade (identification codes such as the ISBN, trade dates,
product details),
kept in its window's "Metadata" tab. What readers then see and buy on
the book's page belongs to [Monograph landing page](U69-monograph-landing-page.md); the
trade blocks only the ONIX feed reads ("Sales Rights", "Market
Territories", representatives) belong to [ONIX metadata & export](U74-onix-metadata-export.md).
<sup>a</sup>

A journal and a preprint server do not install publication formats.
Their publication's pages list "Galleys" and no "Publication Formats",
and a galley has no terms, no approval and no availability switch
([Galleys](U46-galleys.md)). <sup>b</sup>

## Actors & permissions

**The Publication Formats page** is the workflow's "Publication" › the
version › "Publication Formats". Who is offered the page at all is the
workflow screen's rule
([→ the Publication tabs](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#publication-tabs)):
the editorial roles; an assistant role only while the book is in a
stage its role takes part in, and every assistant role once the version
is published; the Author on their own book, in the author's view. **The
managing roles** below are the Press manager, Press editor and
Production editor, the Site Administrator, the Series editor assigned to
the book, and the assistant roles assigned to it that take part in
Production (Layout Editor, Designer, Indexer, Proofreader); "the
assigned assistant roles" below means these four. An assigned
Copyeditor, Marketing and sales coordinator or Funding coordinator can
be offered the page (the first two while the book is in Copyediting,
all three once the version is published) and finds only "You don't
currently have access to that stage of the workflow." there, with no
list ⚠ [A13](#a13). The assignment's metadata-edit permission ("Permit
submission metadata edit.") plays no part on this page, and neither
does a published version (Rule 16). <sup>c</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **See the page and its list** (Rules 2, 3) | • every role the page is offered to (the preamble), except the three assistant roles that find no list there [A13](#a13). The managing roles get the columns "Name", "Complete" and "Availability" and every control of the Fields tables<br>• the Author: the "Name" column alone, with no "Add publication format", no "Change File" or "Select Files" and no arrow before a name; a format file's name still downloads the file, and a remote format's name still opens its address <sup>c</sup> <sup>td1</sup> |
| **Add, edit and delete formats** ("Add publication format"; a format's "Edit" and "Delete"; Rules 4–8, 20) | • the managing roles<br>• the Author: never offered <sup>c</sup> <sup>td2</sup> |
| **Add files to a format and handle its files** ("Change File", "Select Files"; a format file's "More Information", "Edit", "Delete", "Dependent Files"; Rules 9–11) | • the Press manager, Press editor, Production editor, Site Administrator and the assigned Series editor: all of it<br>• the assigned assistant roles: "Change File", and a file's "Edit" and "Delete"; "More Information" opens its window, whose "History" never loads ([Submission files, its A3](U36-submission-files.md#a3)); "Select Files" opens its window, but the window's list of files does not load ⚠ [A1](#a1)<br>• the Author: never offered <sup>c</sup> <sup>td3</sup> |
| **Approve a format and approve a format file** ("Awaiting Approval" / "Approved" in the "Complete" column; Rules 12, 13) | • the managing roles <sup>c</sup> <sup>td4</sup> |
| **Make a format available, and set a file's terms** ("Not Available" / "Available", and "Set Terms" or the terms named, in the "Availability" column; Rules 14, 15) | • the Press manager, Press editor, Production editor, Site Administrator and the assigned Series editor<br>• the assigned assistant roles: both links are offered, and the choice is refused [A1](#a1) <sup>c</sup> <sup>td5</sup> |
| **Fill a format's catalog data** (the format window's "Metadata" tab; Rules 17–19) | • the Press manager, Press editor, Production editor and Site Administrator: the whole tab<br>• the assigned Series editor and assistant roles: the tab opens and its "Save" stores the fields, but its four lists ("Product Identification", "Sales Rights", "Market Territories", "Publication Dates") do not load ⚠ [A2](#a2) <sup>c</sup> <sup>td6</sup> |
| **Set a format's or a format file's identifiers** (the "Identifiers" tabs) | • see [Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md), which names who may save them |

## Fields & validation

<a id="formats-page"></a>
**The Publication Formats page.** Under the heading "Publication:
Publication Formats", one table headed "Publication Formats", with "Add
publication format" above it for the managing roles. One row per format
of the chosen version, and under each format one row per format file,
the newest first. The formats' order is not fixed: saving a format with
"OK" on its "Edit" tab, even with nothing changed, or with "Save" on
its "Metadata" tab, changing its approval or availability, or emptying
its DOI on the DOIs page ([DOIs](U45-dois.md#press-dois)) can move it
to the front, to the end or between two others, or leave it in place
⚠ [A14](#a14). A format file's terms or approval do not move its
format. The new order shows at once and after a reload, and the
Author's list, the book's page and the DOIs page (its Rule 45) list the
formats in the same order. A version with no
format reads "No Items"; a format with no files shows "No Items" under
its row, and a remote format (Rule 5) "This item is remotely hosted."
<sup>d</sup> <sup>td7</sup>

A format's row:

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | — | The format's name, followed without a space by its "Publication Format" choice, such as "PDFDigital (on physical carrier) (DA)", both in the same grey type (a remote format's name in link colour). A remote format's name is a link that opens its address in a new tab. For the managing roles, a format that is not remote also shows the links "Change File" ⚠ [A3](#a3) and "Select Files" (Rules 9, 10), and an arrow before the name opens "Edit" and "Delete" (Rules 8, 20). <sup>d</sup> <sup>td8</sup> |
| **Complete** | — | "Awaiting Approval" or "Approved", a link that opens "Format Approval" (Rule 12). <sup>d</sup> |
| **Availability** | — | "Not Available" or "Available", a link that opens "Format Availability" (Rule 14). <sup>d</sup> |

A format file's row:

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | — | The file's number, with an icon for its kind of document, and its name, a link that downloads the file ([→ downloading](U36-submission-files.md#download)). For the managing roles an arrow before it opens "More Information", "Edit" and "Delete", and on an HTML or XML file also "Dependent Files" (Rule 11). <sup>h</sup> <sup>td8</sup> |
| **Complete** | — | "Awaiting Approval" or "Approved", a link that opens "Approve Proof" or "Revoke Proof Approval" (Rule 13). <sup>h</sup> |
| **Availability** | — | The file's terms, a link that opens "Set Terms for Downloading" (Rule 15): "Set Terms" until terms are saved, then "Open Access", "Direct Sales" or "Not Available". <sup>h</sup> |

**In French.** With the interface in French (Canada), the "Format
Availability" window (Rule 14) is titled "Approbation du format"
("Format Approval") ⚠ [A25](#a25). <sup>f-a25</sup>

<a id="format-window"></a>
**The format window.** "Add publication format" opens a window headed
"Add publication format" with one tab, "Edit". A format's "Edit" opens a
window headed "Edit" with the tabs "Edit", "Metadata" and, while the
press gives formats identifiers (Settings bullets 1 and 3) and the format
is not remote, "Identifiers" (see [Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)). The
"Edit" tab holds a group headed "Format Details", then "Required fields
are marked with an asterisk: *", "OK" and "Cancel". <sup>e</sup> <sup>td9</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Yes, in the book's language and in the press's primary language | One box per language the press offers for metadata. Empty in the book's language, "OK" is refused with "This field is required." under the box and nothing is saved. On a press with more than one metadata language, a book in another language needs the name in the press's primary language too: on a press whose primary language is English, a French book's format with only the French name is refused with "This field is required." under the English box ⚠ [A15](#a15). <sup>e</sup> <sup>td10</sup> |
| **Publication Format** | Yes | A list of five kinds, in alphabetical order: "Audio (AA)", "Digital (delivered electronically) (EA)", "Digital (on physical carrier) (DA)", "Hardback (BB)" and "Paperback / softback (BC)". A new format arrives on "Digital (on physical carrier) (DA)". <sup>e</sup> |
| **Physical format** | No | One box, unticked on a new format. <sup>e</sup> |
| **This format will be available at a separate website** | No | One box. Ticking it shows "URL of remotely-hosted content" and hides "URL Path", emptying it (Rule 5). Unticking it hides the address box but keeps what it holds ⚠ [A4](#a4). <sup>e</sup> <sup>td11</sup> |
| **URL of remotely-hosted content** | No | Shown only while the box above is ticked; a web address box. <sup>e</sup> |
| **URL Path** | No | Help: "An optional path to use in the URL instead of the ID." Shown only while the box above is unticked. Refusal in Rule 6. <sup>e</sup> |
| **ISBN** | No | Two boxes, under the lines "A 13-digit ISBN code, such as 978-951-98548-9-2." and "A 10-digit ISBN code, such as 951-98548-9-4.". Nothing checks what is typed (Rule 7). <sup>e</sup> |

<a id="metadata-tab"></a>
**The "Metadata" tab.** Top to bottom: the lists "Product
Identification" (Rule 18), "Sales Rights" and "Market Territories"
([ONIX metadata & export](U74-onix-metadata-export.md)) and "Publication Dates" (Rule 19), each with
its own add link and rows; then the fields below; then "Required fields
are marked with an asterisk: *", "Cancel" and "Save". Switching to the
"Edit" tab with a changed field asks "The data on this form has changed.
Do you wish to continue without saving?": "OK" switches and drops the
change, "Cancel" stays. The window's close arrow and the tab's "Cancel"
close at once, without asking, and keep nothing ⚠ [A16](#a16).
<sup>f</sup> <sup>td12</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Product Composition** | Yes | A list of seven kinds in alphabetical order ("Multiple-component retail product (10)" first), empty on a new format. Left empty, "Save" is refused with "This field is required." under the list, and nothing is saved. <sup>f</sup> |
| **Product Detail (not required)** | No | A long list of product details, empty on a new format. <sup>f</sup> |
| **Product Availability** | — (always set) | A list ("Available (20)", "In stock (21)", "Not yet available (10)"…), on "Available (20)" for a new format. It has no empty choice, so it always holds a value, and its label carries no asterisk. It is a catalog statement for the trade; it does not change the "Availability" column (Rule 14). <sup>f</sup> |
| **Imprint (Brand Name)** | No | Free text; typing stops at 255 characters. <sup>f</sup> |
| **Page Counts**: "Front Matter", "Back Matter" | No | Free text each ⚠ [A17](#a17). <sup>f</sup> |
| **Returnable Indicator** | No | A list, on "Yes, returnable, full copies only (Y)" for a new format. <sup>f</sup> |
| **Physical Dimensions**: "Height", "Width", "Thickness", "Weight", "Country of Manufacture" | No | Free text each [A17](#a17), with a unit list beside it ("Millimeters (mm)" preselected for the three sizes, "Grams (gr)" for the weight). Every unit list offers the same eight units, lengths and weights alike ⚠ [A18](#a18). The country list arrives on "Canada (CA)". <sup>f</sup> |
| **Digital Information**: "File Size in Mbytes", "Digital Technical Protection", "Enter your own file size value?" | — | Never shown: every format's tab shows the physical groups above, whatever its "Physical format" box says ⚠ [A6](#a6) (Rule 17b). <sup>f</sup> <sup>td13</sup> |

<a id="code-window"></a>
**The code window and the date window.** "Add Code" (under "Product
Identification") and a code's "Edit" open a window with "Code Value"
(required) and "ONIX Code Type" (required), then "OK" and "Cancel".
"Add publication date" (under "Publication Dates") and a date's "Edit"
open a window with "Date" (required), "Date Format" (required, with
"YYYYMMDD (H)" preselected on a new date ⚠ [A7](#a7)) and "Role"
(required; what it arrives on is Rule 19a), then "OK" and "Cancel".
Each window ends with "Required fields are marked with an asterisk: *".
What each list offers and refuses is Rules 18 and 19. <sup>g</sup> <sup>td14</sup>

<a id="terms-window"></a>
**The "Set Terms for Downloading" window.** A format file's terms link
opens it: the text "File formats can be made available for downloading
from the press website through open access at no cost to readers or
direct sales (using an online payment processor, as configured in
Distribution). For this file indicate the basis of access.", the choices
"Open Access", "Direct Sales" and "Not Available", a box "Price
({currency})" ({currency} is the press's currency code, Settings bullet
5) with the line "Prices should be numeric only. Do not include currency
symbols." under it, then "Cancel" and "Save". Rule 15 says what each
choice does and what the price box accepts ⚠ [A8](#a8). Nothing in the
window or the tab says whether the press has a payment method set up
[A9](#a9). "Cancel" closes the window and keeps nothing, without asking.
With a choice or the price changed, the window's close arrow asks "The
data on this form has changed. Do you wish to continue without
saving?": "OK" closes it and drops the change, "Cancel" keeps the
window. <sup>j</sup> <sup>td15</sup> <sup>td31</sup>

**The approval and availability windows.** Each shows a short text and
"OK" and "Cancel" (texts in Rules 12–14). <sup>k</sup> <sup>l</sup>

**The delete dialog.** Titled "Delete", with "Are you sure you wish to
delete this item? This action cannot be undone." and "OK" and "Cancel"
(Rule 20). <sup>m</sup>

## Rules & state

1. **What a format is.** A format belongs to one version of the book.
   It has a name, a kind ("Publication Format"), a physical flag, and
   either format files or, for a remote format, an address. It carries
   two independent states shown in its row: approval ("Awaiting
   Approval" / "Approved") and availability ("Not Available" /
   "Available"); each of its files carries its own approval and terms.
   <sup>a</sup> <sup>d</sup>
2. **Which formats the page lists.** The page lists the formats of the
   version chosen under "Publication"; choosing another version lists
   that version's formats. The page and everything on it work the same
   whichever stage the book is in, so a format can be built while the
   book is still in review, by any managing role the side menu offers
   the page to. <sup>d</sup> <sup>td7</sup>
3. **The Author's view.** The Author sees each format's name and kind
   and, under it, its files by number and name, each name a link that
   downloads the file. The Author sees no approval, availability or terms
   and has no control on the page (Actors). <sup>c</sup> <sup>td1</sup>
4. **Adding a format.** "Add publication format" › fill the "Edit" tab
   › "OK" closes the window and lists the new format at the end, reading
   "Awaiting Approval" and "Not Available", with "No Items" under it.
   Nothing else opens and no notice appears; files are added from the
   row afterwards (Rules 9, 10) and the catalog data from its "Edit"
   (Rule 17). <sup>e</sup> <sup>td2</sup>
   - 4a. **Leaving without saving.** "Cancel" closes the window and keeps
     nothing, without asking. With a field changed, the window's close
     arrow asks "The data on this form has changed. Do you wish to
     continue without saving?": "OK" closes and drops the change,
     "Cancel" keeps the window. <sup>e</sup> <sup>td9</sup>
5. **Remote formats.** A **remote format** is one saved with "This
   format will be available at a separate website." ticked: it sends
   readers to the address in "URL of remotely-hosted content" and holds
   no files. Its row offers no "Change File" or "Select Files", shows
   "This item is remotely hosted." under it, and its name is a link to
   the address. Its "Edit" window has no "Identifiers" tab, and its
   "Format Approval" asks no identifier question (Rule 12a). A remote
   format stays remote once saved: unticking the box and pressing "OK"
   keeps the address and the format [A4](#a4). <sup>e</sup> <sup>td11</sup>
6. **URL Path is checked on "OK".** An empty box is fine. A path holding
   anything but letters and digits joined by single dots, dashes or
   underscores (a space, a "/", a leading dash) is refused with "This
   may only contain letters, numbers, dashes, underscores and periods."
   under the box, and nothing is saved. In a format's "Edit" window the
   message also comes back later: the next "OK" that saves the format
   shows it again as a notice, once per refused path ⚠ [A24](#a24). A
   path made only of digits, or one another format of the same version
   already uses, is saved ⚠ [A5](#a5). What
   the path changes for readers is in Side effects. <sup>e</sup> <sup>td16</sup>
7. **The ISBN boxes.** The "ISBN" boxes are a shortcut into the
   format's "Product Identification" list (Rule 18): "OK" stores the
   13-digit box as the code "ISBN-13 (15)" and the 10-digit box as
   "ISBN-10 (Discontinued)", replacing any such codes the format had; an
   emptied box removes its code. The boxes show the codes' current
   values when the window opens. <sup>e</sup> <sup>td17</sup>
8. **Editing a format.** An arrow before the format's name, then "Edit",
   opens the format window (Fields). "OK" on the "Edit" tab stores it,
   closes the window, and the row shows the new name and kind at once.
   The save shows no notice of its own; a "URL Path" refused earlier in
   the same window shows its message as a notice now [A24](#a24).
   Switching tabs with a changed field asks the question
   of Rule 4a. <sup>e</sup> <sup>td9</sup>
9. **Adding a file with "Change File".** A format's "Change File" opens
   the upload wizard titled "Upload a File Ready for Publication"
   ([→ the upload wizard](U36-submission-files.md#upload-wizard)). After
   "Complete" the file is listed under the format, "Awaiting Approval",
   with "Set Terms" as its terms. Each upload adds another file; the
   label says "Change File" though nothing is replaced [A3](#a3). A
   format holds any number of files. <sup>h</sup> <sup>td18</sup>
10. **Adding a file with "Select Files".** A format's "Select Files"
    opens a window titled "Select Files" with the text "Any files that
    have already been uploaded to any submission stage can be added to
    the Proof Files listing by checking the Include checkbox below and
    clicking Search: all available files will be listed and can be
    chosen for inclusion." ⚠ [A19](#a19), a list headed "Page Proofs"
    of the book's "Production Ready Files" with the columns "Select",
    "Name" and "Component", each file unticked, the box "Show files from
    all accessible workflow stages." that reloads the list at once with
    the other stages' files, and "Cancel" and "OK". How the window's
    list behaves is
    *[Submission files](U36-submission-files.md#select-window)*'.
    <sup>i</sup> <sup>td19</sup>
    - 10a. **"OK" and closing.** "OK" copies each ticked file into the
      format as a new format file, "Awaiting Approval" and with "Set
      Terms" as its terms; the file it was copied from stays where it
      was. Ticking the same file again later adds a second copy. The
      window's close arrow closes it at once, ticks and all, without
      asking, and nothing is copied. <sup>i</sup> <sup>td19</sup>
11. **A format file's own actions.** "More Information" opens the file's
    window of *[Submission files](U36-submission-files.md#more-information)*.
    "Edit" opens a window headed "Edit a file" with the tabs "Edit
    Metadata" (the file's details) and, while the press gives files
    identifiers (Settings bullets 2 and 3), "Identifiers" (see
    [Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)). The window works as on any file
    list ([→ Submission files](U36-submission-files.md#file-details)):
    "Save" stores the details, and "Cancel" and the close arrow close
    it at once, without asking, even with the name changed, and keep
    nothing. "Delete" works as on any file list
    ([→ deleting](U36-submission-files.md#delete)). On an HTML or XML
    file, "Dependent Files" opens a window of that name holding the
    file's dependent-files list
    ([→ dependent files](U36-submission-files.md#dependent-files)).
    <sup>h</sup> <sup>td8</sup>
12. **Approving a format.** A format's "Awaiting Approval" opens a window
    titled "Format Approval": "Approve the metadata for this format.
    Metadata can be checked from the Edit panel for each format.", with
    "OK" and "Cancel". "OK" closes it and the row reads "Approved".
    "Approved" opens the same title with "Indicate that the metadata for
    this format has not been approved."; "OK" sets "Awaiting Approval"
    again. What approval changes for readers is in Side effects.
    <sup>k</sup> <sup>td4</sup>
    - 12a. **The URN step.** While URNs are assigned to publication
      formats (Settings bullet 3) the window also carries the format's
      URN step, which is *[Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)*' (its Rule
      16a); a remote format's window has none. With that step's box
      changed, the window's close arrow asks "The data on this form has
      changed. Do you wish to continue without saving?": "OK" closes it
      and keeps nothing (reopened, the box is ticked again), "Cancel"
      keeps the window. <sup>k</sup> <sup>td4</sup>
13. **Approving a format file.** A file's "Awaiting Approval" opens a
    window titled "Approve Proof": "Approve this proof to indicate
    proofreading is complete and the file is ready to be published.",
    with "OK" and "Cancel"; "OK" sets "Approved". "Approved" opens
    "Revoke Proof Approval": "Revoke approval for this proof to indicate
    proofreading is no longer complete and the file is not ready to be
    published."; "OK" sets "Awaiting Approval" again. A file's approval
    changes nothing readers get: an unapproved file with terms in an
    available format is offered on the book's page all the same
    ⚠ [A10](#a10). <sup>k</sup> <sup>td20</sup>
14. **Making a format available.** A format's "Not Available" opens a
    window titled "Format Availability": "Make this format available to
    readers. Downloadable files and any other distributions will appear
    in the book's catalog entry.", with "OK" and "Cancel"; "OK" sets
    "Available". "Available" opens the same title with "This format will
    unavailable to readers. Any downloadable files or other distributions
    will no longer appear in the book's catalog entry." ⚠ [A11](#a11);
    "OK" sets "Not Available". Availability does not wait for approval:
    a format still "Awaiting Approval" can be made available, and the
    reverse. <sup>l</sup> <sup>td21</sup>
15. **Setting a file's terms.** The terms link opens "Set Terms for
    Downloading" (Fields). <sup>j</sup>
    - 15a. **Opening.** A file with no terms saved opens with "Not
      Available" chosen and the price box greyed out; a file with terms
      opens on its choice, and a "Direct Sales" file with its price.
      Pressing "Save" on a file with no terms, without a change, stores
      "Not Available": the link turns from "Set Terms" to "Not
      Available". <sup>j</sup> <sup>td22</sup>
    - 15b. **"Direct Sales".** Choosing it makes the price box editable;
      "Save" stays greyed out while the box is empty or holds something
      that is not a number. On "Save" the price must be a whole number
      or carry exactly two decimals ("10", "10.50", or ".99" with no
      whole part); anything else, "10.5" and "-5" included, is refused
      with "A valid price is required." and nothing is saved: the window
      stays open with "Errors occurred processing this form" at its top
      and the message in place of the "Price (…)" label [A8](#a8).
      <sup>j</sup> <sup>td15</sup>
    - 15c. **"Open Access" and "Not Available".** Choosing either greys
      out the price box, which keeps showing what was typed until the
      window is saved; "Save" stores the choice and drops any price.
      <sup>j</sup> <sup>td22</sup>
    - 15d. **After "Save".** The window closes and the file's link reads
      the choice: "Open Access", "Direct Sales" or "Not Available". A
      "Direct Sales" price of 0 is saved: the link still reads "Direct
      Sales", the window then reopens on "Open Access", and the book's
      page offers the file free ⚠ [A20](#a20). <sup>j</sup> <sup>td15</sup>
16. **Published versions.** On a published version the page keeps every
    control and every window above, for the same roles, and each change
    reaches readers at once. The editorial view shows "Warning: This
    version has been published. Editing it may impact the published
    content." above the list; the author's view shows "This version has
    been published and can not be edited." <sup>n</sup> <sup>td23</sup>
17. **The "Metadata" tab.** It exists once the format is saved: a new
    format's window has only the "Edit" tab. <sup>f</sup>
    - 17a. **"Save".** "Save" stores the tab's fields and closes the
      window, with no notice. "Product Composition" is required: left
      empty, "Save" is refused with "This field is required." under it
      and nothing is saved. "Product Availability" has no empty choice,
      so it always holds a value (Fields). The four lists save on their
      own (Rules 18, 19), not with "Save". <sup>f</sup> <sup>td12</sup>
    - 17b. **Always the physical groups.** Every format's tab shows
      "Page Counts", "Returnable Indicator" and "Physical Dimensions",
      a digital or remote format's included, and never "Digital
      Information" [A6](#a6). <sup>f</sup> <sup>td13</sup>
18. **"Product Identification".** The list shows each code under "Code
    Value" and "ONIX Code Type". "Add Code" opens the code window
    (Fields); "OK" adds the row and the notice "Identification Code
    added." appears. A row's arrow offers "Edit" ("Identification Code
    edited.") and "Delete", which asks as the delete dialog does and
    ends with "Identification Code removed.". <sup>g</sup> <sup>td24</sup>
    - 18a. **What the code window accepts.** The "ONIX Code Type" list
      offers each type once per format: a type the format already uses
      is not offered again, except a code's own type in its "Edit".
      While the press assigns DOIs (Settings bullet 4), "DOI (06)" is
      never offered, even when the press gives formats no DOIs
      ⚠ [A21](#a21). An empty "Code Value" is refused with "This field
      is required." under the box, and nothing is saved. Nothing checks
      a value's form, an ISBN's included. <sup>g</sup> <sup>td24</sup>
    - 18b. **A "Code Value" of spaces.** A "Code Value" holding only
      spaces is refused: the window stays open with the box emptied and
      no message, "Required fields are marked with an asterisk: *"
      shows a second time, and no row is added. "A value is required."
      shows only later, as a notice beside the next "Identification
      Code added." [A23](#a23). <sup>g</sup> <sup>td32</sup>
19. **"Publication Dates".** The list shows each date under "Date" and
    "Role". "Add publication date" opens the date window (Fields); "OK"
    adds the row with the notice "Publication Date added.". A row's
    "Edit" and "Delete" end with "Publication Date edited." and
    "Publication Date removed.". <sup>g</sup> <sup>td14</sup>
    - 19a. **"Role".** The list offers each role once per format, in
      alphabetical order, and arrives on the first one the format has
      not used ("CIP date (35)" on a format with no date) ⚠ [A22](#a22).
      A date's "Edit" also offers, and arrives on, the date's own role.
      <sup>g</sup> <sup>td14</sup>
    - 19b. **The date check.** A date must have as many characters as
      its "Date Format" without the bracketed part (8 for "YYYYMMDD" and
      "YYYYMMDD (H)", 4 for "YYYY"); a "Text string" format takes any
      text. Nothing checks that the characters make a date. A date of
      the wrong length is refused: the window stays open with no
      message, and "Required fields are marked with an asterisk: *"
      shows a second time ⚠ [A23](#a23). The message "A date is required
      and the date value must match the chosen date format." appears
      only later, as a notice beside the next "Publication Date added.".
      An empty "Date" is refused with "This field is required." under
      the box, and nothing is saved. <sup>g</sup> <sup>td14</sup>
20. **Deleting a format.** An arrow before the format's name, then
    "Delete", opens the delete dialog. "OK" removes the format and its
    files, and the notice "Publication Format removed." appears. There
    is no undo. "Cancel" changes nothing.
    Its codes, dates, sales rights and markets go with it (read from the code: no screen shows a deleted format's lists).
    <sup>m</sup> <sup>td25</sup>
21. **A new version.** "Create New Version"
    ([→ Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md),
    its Rule 11) gives the new version a copy of each format with its
    name, kind, physical flag, address, URL path, approval, availability
    and catalog data, and a copy of each of its files with the file's
    approval and terms. The copies then change on the new version's page
    without touching the earlier version's. <sup>n</sup> <sup>td26</sup>

## Side effects

- **Notices.** Deleting a format shows "Publication Format removed.";
  the code and date lists show their notices (Rules 18, 19). Adding or
  editing a format, uploading or selecting its files, the two approvals,
  availability, terms and the "Metadata" tab's "Save" show none of their
  own; an edit saved after a refused "URL Path" shows that refusal's
  message (Rule 6, [A24](#a24)).
  <sup>o</sup> <sup>td27</sup>
- **No email.** Nothing on this page sends an email or adds a Tasks
  entry. <sup>o</sup> <sup>td27</sup>
- **Activity Log.** Creating and deleting a format, approving it or
  revoking the approval, and making it available or not available each
  add a line to the book's Activity Log; the lines and their wording are
  *[Submission activity log & notes](U38-submission-activity-log-and-notes.md)*'
  (its Rule 11). A choice the app refuses adds none. A file's upload
  writes the lines any upload writes
  ([→ Submission files](U36-submission-files.md#more-information)).
  <sup>o</sup> <sup>td20</sup>
- **A format file's "History".** Approving a format file, and revoking
  that approval, each add the same two lines to the file's "More
  Information" › "History": 'The metadata for file "{file name}" was
  edited by {username}.' and '"{full name}" ({username}) has signed off
  on the signoff for "{file name}."' ⚠ [A12](#a12). The first of the two
  also goes to the book's Activity Log. <sup>o</sup> <sup>td20</sup>
- **What readers see.** Once the version is published, the book's page
  lists each remote format that reads "Available" as a link to its
  address, and each file an available format offers (next bullet) under
  its format's name. A format that reads "Available" but whose files
  are all "Not Available" or have no terms is not on the page. A format
  that also reads "Approved" shows its catalog block (identification
  codes, dates, identifiers) there. A format's URL Path replaces its
  number in its files' addresses. The page, the purchase and the
  downloads are [Monograph landing page](U69-monograph-landing-page.md)'s. <sup>p</sup> <sup>td28</sup>
- **The files readers are offered.** An "Open Access" file is a link
  reading the format's name that opens the file's view page. A "Direct
  Sales" file's link reads "{price} Purchase {format} ({price}
  {currency code})", such as "25.00 Purchase PDF (25.00 USD)", on a
  press with a currency and a payment method; a signed-in reader who
  presses it gets the payment page ("Manual Fee Payment", "Fee 25.00
  (USD)"). On a press with neither, the link reads only the format's
  name, with no price; a visitor who presses it is sent to "Login" and
  a signed-in reader to the "Catalog", with no message ⚠ [A9](#a9). A
  file set "Not Available", or with no terms saved, is not offered.
  <sup>p</sup> <sup>td28</sup>
- **Harvesting.** A format of a published book that reads "Available"
  is a record of the press's OAI list, whether or not it reads
  "Approved"; one set "Not Available" is not
  ([Harvesting (OAI-PMH)](U19-oai-pmh.md), its Rule 3a). <sup>p</sup>
- **DOIs.** A press that gives publication formats DOIs assigns them as
  *[DOIs](U45-dois.md)* describes. <sup>q</sup>
- **Files deleted.** Deleting a format deletes its files (Rule 20):
  they leave a chapter's "Files" list too. <sup>m</sup> <sup>td25</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

1. **"Enable for Publication Formats"** under "Publisher ID" (Settings ›
   Workflow › Submission › "Metadata", *[Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)*).
   Unticked on a new press: a format's "Edit" window has the tabs "Edit"
   and "Metadata". Ticked: it gains "Identifiers" on every format that is
   not remote (Fields, the format window). <sup>q</sup>
2. **"Enable for Files"** under the same "Publisher ID". Unticked on a
   new press: a format file's "Edit a file" window has "Edit Metadata"
   alone. Ticked: it gains "Identifiers" (Rule 11). <sup>q</sup>
3. **The "URN" plugin with "Publication Formats" or "Files" ticked**
   (Settings › Website › "Plugins", the "URN" row's "Settings",
   *[Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)*). Off on a new press. With
   "Publication Formats": the format window gains "Identifiers" and
   "Format Approval" gains the URN step (Rule 12a). With "Files": a
   format file's "Edit a file" gains "Identifiers", and "Approve Proof"
   gains the file's URN step. The plugin's settings window saves
   "Files" only together with "Monographs" or "Publication Formats"
   ([Identifiers, its OMP1](U44-identifiers.md#omp1)). <sup>q</sup> <sup>td29</sup>
4. **"DOIs"** (Settings › Distribution › "DOIs", the box "Allow Digital
   Object Identifiers (DOIs) to be assigned to work published by this
   press.", *[DOIs](U45-dois.md)*). Ticked on a new press: the "ONIX Code
   Type" list never offers "DOI (06)" (Rule 18a). Unticked: it offers it.
   <sup>q</sup> <sup>td24</sup>
5. **"Currency"** (Settings › Distribution › "Payments",
   *[Payments & APCs](U52-payments-and-apcs.md#payments-tab)*). None on a
   new press: the terms window's price box reads "Price ()". Saved, it
   names the currency's code, such as "Price (USD)" (Fields, the terms
   window). <sup>q</sup> <sup>td30</sup>

## Cross-feature interactions

- *[Workflow screen & stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#publication-tabs)*:
  who is offered the Publication Formats page, its heading and the

  setting that hides "DOI (06)" from the code list.
- *[Payments & APCs](U52-payments-and-apcs.md)*: the press's payment
  method and currency, used by "Direct Sales".
- *[Submission activity log & notes](U38-submission-activity-log-and-notes.md)*:
  the Activity Log lines of a format.
- *[Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)*:

- *[Harvesting (OAI-PMH)](U19-oai-pmh.md)*: one record per available
  format.
- *[Media files](U47-media-files.md)*: the images an HTML format file
  shows on the book's page.
- *[Chapters & work type](U72-chapters-work-type.md)*: a chapter's
  "Files" list, which offers format files too.
- *[Usage statistics](U64-usage-statistics.md)*: downloads of format
  files.
- [Monograph landing page](U69-monograph-landing-page.md): the book's page, its format
  list, the downloads and the purchase of a "Direct Sales" file.

## Canonical scenarios

Scenarios 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 run on the seeded press with ready accounts
and scratch books, and scenario 11 on the seeded journal and the seeded
preprint server, its control on the seeded press. Scenario 6 runs on a
scratch press that takes payments in US dollars, its control on a second
scratch press with no payment settings, and scenario 10 on a scratch
press with DOIs switched off, each with a throwaway Press manager and a
throwaway Author. The accounts, the passwords, the mail catcher and the
tooling recipe are in the footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **A format built and made available**

   Given: Press manager and the Author, on the Author's book in
   Production, which has no publication format.

   - **The empty page**: open the book's "Publication" › the version ›
     "Publication Formats": under the heading "Publication: Publication
     Formats" a table headed "Publication Formats" reads "No Items", with
     "Add publication format" above it and the columns "Name", "Complete"
     and "Availability" (Fields, the page; Actors row 1).
   - **"Add publication format"**: press it: a window headed "Add
     publication format" opens with the one tab "Edit", holding the
     group "Format Details" with "Name", "Publication Format" on
     "Digital (on physical carrier) (DA)", "Physical format" unticked,
     "This format will be available at a separate website", "URL Path"
     and the two "ISBN" boxes, then "Required fields are marked with an
     asterisk: *", "OK" and "Cancel" (Fields, the format window).
   - **An empty name**: press "OK" with nothing typed: "This field is
     required." shows under the "Name" box, the window stays open, and
     nothing is saved (Fields, "Name").
   - **"PDF"**: type PDF in "Name" and press "OK": the window closes with
     no notice, and the list shows one format reading "PDFDigital (on
     physical carrier) (DA)", "Awaiting Approval" and "Not Available",
     with the links "Change File" and "Select Files" and "No Items" under
     it (Rule 4; Fields, a format's row).
   - **A file uploaded**: press "Change File": the upload wizard titled
     "Upload a File Ready for Publication" opens
     ([→ the upload wizard](U36-submission-files.md#upload-wizard)).
     Upload article.pdf with "Book Manuscript" as its component and press
     "Complete": under "PDF" a row shows the file's number and
     article.pdf, "Awaiting Approval" and "Set Terms", and no notice
     appears (Rule 9; Fields, a format file's row).
   - **"Open Access"**: press "Set Terms": the window "Set Terms for
     Downloading" opens with "Not Available" chosen and the price box
     greyed out (Rule 15a). Choose "Open Access" and press "Save": the
     window closes and the file's link reads "Open Access" (Rules 15c,
     15d).
   - **The format approved**: press the format's "Awaiting Approval": a
     window titled "Format Approval" reads "Approve the metadata for this
     format. Metadata can be checked from the Edit panel for each
     format.", with "OK" and "Cancel"; press "OK": the format reads
     "Approved" (Rule 12).
   - **The file approved**: press the file's "Awaiting Approval": a
     window titled "Approve Proof" reads "Approve this proof to indicate
     proofreading is complete and the file is ready to be published.";
     press "OK": the file reads "Approved" (Rule 13).
   - **Made available**: press the format's "Not Available": a window
     titled "Format Availability" reads "Make this format available to
     readers. Downloadable files and any other distributions will appear
     in the book's catalog entry."; press "OK": the format reads
     "Available". None of the presses above showed a notice (Rule 14;
     Side effects, "Notices").
   - **The Author's view**: Author: open the book from My Submissions and
     choose "Publication" › the version › "Publication Formats": the list
     has the "Name" column alone, reading "PDFDigital (on physical
     carrier) (DA)" with the file's number and article.pdf under it, and
     offers no "Add publication format", "Change File", "Select Files",
     "Awaiting Approval", "Approved", "Available", terms link or arrow
     before a name. Press article.pdf: the browser downloads article.pdf
     (Rule 3; Actors row 1).
   - **Control**: the mail catcher holds no email to the Author about the
     book's formats (Side effects, "No email"). <sup>s</sup>

2. **A format's catalog data**

   Given: Press manager, on a book in Production with the format "PDF",
   which holds article.pdf and reads "Approved" and "Available".

   - **The "Metadata" tab**: on the book's "Publication Formats" page
     press the arrow before "PDF", then "Edit": a window headed "Edit"
     opens on its "Edit" tab, with a "Metadata" tab
     beside it. Press "Metadata": from the top it shows the lists
     "Product Identification", "Sales Rights", "Market Territories" and
     "Publication Dates", each with its own add link; then "Product
     Composition", empty, "Product Detail (not required)", empty,
     "Product Availability" on "Available (20)" and "Imprint (Brand
     Name)"; and at the bottom "Cancel" and "Save" (Fields, the
     "Metadata" tab). Which groups follow on this digital format is
     [A6](#a6), neither a pass nor a fail here.
   - **"Product Composition" required**: type Tidewater Books in "Imprint
     (Brand Name)" and press "Save": "This field is required." shows
     under "Product Composition" and the window stays open (Rule 17a).
   - **Saved**: choose "Multiple-component retail product (10)" in
     "Product Composition" and "Not yet available (10)" in "Product
     Availability", and press "Save": the window closes with no notice,
     and the "PDF" row still reads "Available" (Rule 17a; Fields,
     "Product Availability"). Reopen "Edit" › "Metadata": the tab holds
     "Multiple-component retail product (10)", "Not yet available (10)"
     and Tidewater Books.
   - **The ISBN boxes**: on the "Edit" tab type 978-951-98548-9-2 in the
     13-digit "ISBN" box and press "OK": the window closes. Reopen "Edit"
     › "Metadata": "Product Identification" lists 978-951-98548-9-2 under
     "Code Value" with "ISBN-13 (15)" under "ONIX Code Type" (Rule 7).
   - **"Add Code"**: press "Add Code": a window opens with "Code Value"
     and "ONIX Code Type", then "OK" and "Cancel", and the type list does
     not offer "ISBN-13 (15)", which the format already uses (Rule 18a).
     Press "OK" with "Code Value" empty: "This field is required." shows
     under the box and no row is added (Rule 18a). Choose "ISBN-10
     (Discontinued)", type 951-98548-9-4 in "Code Value" and press "OK":
     the row is added and the notice "Identification Code added."
     appears (Rule 18).
   - **A code edited and deleted**: press the arrow before the
     951-98548-9-4 row, then "Edit", replace the value with
     951-98548-9-5 and press "OK": the row reads 951-98548-9-5 and the
     notice "Identification Code edited." appears. Press its arrow, then
     "Delete": the dialog titled "Delete" reads "Are you sure you wish to
     delete this item? This action cannot be undone."; press "OK": the
     row is gone and the notice "Identification Code removed." appears
     (Rule 18).
   - **A publication date**: press "Add publication date": a window
     opens with "Date", "Date Format" and "Role", then "OK" and "Cancel".
     Choose "YYYYMMDD" in "Date Format" and leave "Role" as it arrives
     (what it arrives on is [A22](#a22), neither a pass nor a fail
     here). Press "OK" with "Date" empty: "This field is required." shows
     under the box. Type 2026091 and press "OK": the window stays open
     and no row is added (what the window shows is [A23](#a23), neither
     a pass nor a fail here). Replace it with 20260915 and press "OK":
     the window closes, a row is added under "Date" and "Role", and the
     notice "Publication Date added." appears (Rules 19, 19b).
   - **Control**: on the "Edit" tab empty the 13-digit "ISBN" box and
     press "OK": reopened, "Metadata"'s "Product Identification" no
     longer lists 978-951-98548-9-2 (Rule 7). <sup>s</sup>

3. **A Layout Editor and a Series editor build a format**

   Given: Layout Editor, Series editor and the Author, on the Author's
   book in Production, which has no publication format and to which the
   Layout Editor and the Series editor are assigned.

   - **The Layout Editor's page**: Layout Editor: open the book's
     "Publication" › the version › "Publication Formats": the table shows
     "Add publication format" and the columns "Name", "Complete" and
     "Availability" (Actors row 1).
   - **"EPUB" added**: press "Add publication format", type EPUB in
     "Name" and press "OK": "EPUB" is listed, "Awaiting Approval" and "Not
     Available", with "No Items" under it; the arrow before its name
     offers "Edit" and "Delete" (Rule 4; Actors row 2).
   - **A file uploaded**: press "EPUB"'s "Change File", upload
     article.pdf with "Book Manuscript" as its component and press
     "Complete": article.pdf is listed under "EPUB", "Awaiting Approval"
     and "Set Terms"; the arrow before it offers "More Information",
     "Edit" and "Delete" (Rule 9; Actors row 3).
   - **Both approved**: press "EPUB"'s "Awaiting Approval", then "OK" in
     "Format Approval": "EPUB" reads "Approved". Press the file's
     "Awaiting Approval", then "OK" in "Approve Proof": the file reads
     "Approved" (Rules 12, 13; Actors row 4). The Layout Editor's row
     also offers "Not Available" and "Set Terms"; what they do for this
     role is [A1](#a1), neither a pass nor a fail here.
   - **The Series editor**: Series editor: open the same page: "EPUB"
     reads "Approved" and "Not Available", its file "Approved" and "Set
     Terms". Press "Set Terms", choose "Open Access" and press "Save": the
     link reads "Open Access". Press "Not Available", then "OK" in
     "Format Availability": "EPUB" reads "Available" (Rules 14, 15;
     Actors rows 3, 5).
   - **Control**: Author: the book's "Publication Formats" list reads
     "EPUBDigital (on physical carrier) (DA)" with article.pdf under it
     and no "Approved", "Available" or "Open Access" (Rule 3).
     <sup>s</sup>

4. **Files added with "Select Files", and a file's approval revoked**

   Given: Press manager, on a book in Production whose "Production Ready
   Files" hold replacement.pdf, with the format "PDF", which holds
   article.pdf.

   - **"Select Files"**: on the book's "Publication Formats" page press
     "PDF"'s "Select Files": a window titled "Select Files" opens with a
     list headed "Page Proofs" under the columns "Select", "Name" and
     "Component", listing replacement.pdf unticked, the box "Show files
     from all accessible workflow stages.", and "Cancel" and "OK" (Rule
     10). Its text is [A19](#a19), neither a pass nor a fail here.
   - **Closed from its arrow**: tick replacement.pdf and press the
     window's close arrow: the window closes at once, without asking, and
     "PDF" still holds article.pdf alone (Rule 10a).
   - **A file copied**: press "Select Files" again, tick replacement.pdf
     and press "OK": replacement.pdf is listed under "PDF" as a new format
     file, "Awaiting Approval" and "Set Terms" (Rule 10a).
   - **A format file's actions**: press the arrow before article.pdf: it
     offers "More Information", "Edit" and "Delete". "More Information"
     opens the file's window of
     [Submission files](U36-submission-files.md#more-information); close
     it. "Edit" opens a window headed "Edit a file" on its "Edit Metadata"
     tab ([→ the file's details](U36-submission-files.md#file-details));
     close it (Rule 11; Fields, a format file's row).
   - **Approved and revoked**: press article.pdf's "Awaiting Approval",
     then "OK" in "Approve Proof": the file reads "Approved". Press
     "Approved": a window titled "Revoke Proof Approval" reads "Revoke
     approval for this proof to indicate proofreading is no longer
     complete and the file is not ready to be published."; press "OK":
     the file reads "Awaiting Approval" again (Rule 13).
   - **The copy deleted**: press the arrow before replacement.pdf under
     "PDF", then "Delete", and confirm as on any file list
     ([→ deleting](U36-submission-files.md#delete)): "PDF" holds
     article.pdf alone (Rule 11).
   - **Control**: the Production stage's "Production Ready Files" still
     lists replacement.pdf: copying it into the format left it where it
     was (Rule 10a). <sup>s</sup>

5. **A published book's formats, withdrawn and restored**

   Given: Press manager, the Author and a visitor, on the Author's
   published book with the formats "PDF", which holds article.pdf, and
   "EPUB", which holds replacement.pdf, each reading "Approved" and
   "Available" with its file on "Open Access".

   - **The warning**: Press manager: the book's "Publication Formats"
     page shows "Warning: This version has been published. Editing it
     may impact the published content." above the list, with "Add
     publication format" and the columns "Name", "Complete" and
     "Availability" (Rule 16).
   - **The book's page**: visitor: open the book's page from the press's
     catalog ([Catalog browse](U68-catalog-browse.md#book-summary)): it
     lists "PDF" and "EPUB", each file a link reading its format's name
     that opens the file's view page (Side effects, "What readers see"
     and "The files readers are offered").
   - **Leaving the terms window**: Press manager: press the "Open Access"
     link of "EPUB"'s file: "Set Terms for Downloading" opens on "Open
     Access" (Rule 15a). Choose "Not Available" and press "Cancel": the

8. **A format edited, its URL Path refused, and the format deleted**

   Given: Press manager, on a book in Production whose files hold
   article.pdf, with the chapter "Tides" and the format "PDF", which
   holds replacement.pdf.

   - **The chapter's "Files"**: on the book's "Publication" › the version
     › "Chapters" page press
     "Tides": its window's "Files" offers replacement.pdf
     ([Chapters & work type](U72-chapters-work-type.md)); press "Cancel"

     Format", replace a/b with print-edition in "URL Path" and press
     "OK": the window closes, and the row reads "PrintPaperback /
     softback (BC)". Reopened, "Edit" holds Print, "Paperback / softback

   - **"Create New Version"**: create a version with the side menu's
     "Create New Version"
     ([Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)):
     the new version's "Publication Formats" page lists "PDFDigital (on
     physical carrier) (DA)", "Approved" and "Available", with
     article.pdf under it, "Awaiting Approval" and "Open Access" (Rule
     21).

     replace the name with PDF second edition and press "OK": the row
     reads "PDF second editionDigital (on physical carrier) (DA)" (Rules

    Given: Journal Manager (Preprint Server Manager), on the seeded
    journal (the seeded preprint server), with an article (a preprint)
    in Production carrying the galley "PDF".

    - **The version's pages**: open the article's "Publication" (the
      preprint's "Preprint") › the version: it lists "Galleys" and no
      "Publication Formats" (Purpose, the absence paragraph).
    - **The galley**: choose "Galleys": the galley "PDF" is listed with
      no "Awaiting Approval", "Approved", "Not Available", "Available" or
      "Set Terms" (Purpose, the absence paragraph).

      Production lists "Publication Formats" under "Publication" › the

## Coverage

Left out of the scenarios above, by reason:

- **Planned**:
  - the guard for A6 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A6-digital-format-metadata-tab-asks-physical-details.md`):
    a digital format's "Metadata" tab shows "Digital Information" and no
    physical group, and a remotely hosted format's shows neither
  - the guard for A1 and A2 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A1-A2-format-controls-offered-then-refused.md`):
    the assigned Layout Editor makes a format "Available", opens "Set
    Terms" on its form and "Select Files" on its list, and the "Metadata"
    tab's four lists load for the Layout Editor and the assigned Series
    editor
  - the guard for A9 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A9-priced-file-no-payment-method-turns-readers-away.md`):
    on a press with no currency, a "Direct Sales" save in "Set Terms for
    Downloading" is refused with its message, and a reader who opens a
    file priced earlier is told it is not available
  - the guard for A17 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U74-A7-A8-sales-rights-market-values-fail-native-export.md`):
    a physical format's "Metadata" tab refuses "xii" as "Front Matter"
    and "tall" as "Height", and the book's Native XML export completes
  - the guard for A3 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A3-format-change-file-only-adds.md`): a format's
    second "Change File" offers its first file to replace, and with it
    chosen the format still lists one file
  - the guard for A4 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A4-remote-format-cannot-be-made-local.md`): the
    dataset's remote "PDF", its box unticked and "OK" pressed, reopens
    unticked with an empty address and offers "Change File"
  - the guard for A12 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A12-proof-approval-revoke-logged-as-sign-off.md`):
    a format file approved and then revoked shows two different lines in
    its "History"
  - the guard for A13 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A13-copyeditor-formats-page-no-list.md`): a press
    Copyeditor on a book in Copyediting is not offered "Publication
    Formats", and the assigned Layout Editor in Production is
  - the guard for A15 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A15-format-name-required-primary-language.md`): on a
    press with English and French form languages, a French book's format
    and chapter save with French names alone
  - the guard for A24 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U09-A11-static-page-refusal-repeated-after-save.md`):
    after two refused "URL Path" values in a format's "Edit" window, the
    save of a good one shows no notice
  - the guard for A20 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U73-A20-direct-sales-price-zero-gives-file-free.md`):
    "Direct Sales" at "0" and at "0.00" is refused in "Set Terms for
    Downloading", the window staying on "Direct Sales"
  - the guard for A25 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U69-A15-omp-french-purchase-link-and-availability-title-wrong.md`):
    in French (Canada), the window a format's availability link opens
    is titled for availability ("Disponibilité du format")
  - a format file's "Edit a file" closed with its close arrow after the
    name is changed: no question, the row keeping the old name after a
    reload, and "Edit" reopening on it (Rule 11): likely a bullet in
    scenario 4's "A format file's actions", which closes that window
  - the guard for A14 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U46-A7-galley-format-moves-in-list-when-saved.md`): an
    unchanged "OK" on the first of three formats, an approval and an
    availability change leave the list in the order the formats were added
  - the guard for A7 (issue report
    `docs/issues/U74-A5-new-market-and-date-preselect-hijri-calendar.md`):
    "Add publication date" opens with "Date Format" on "YYYYMMDD"
- **Nothing new to test**:
  - "Format Approval" with its URN box changed, whose close arrow asks
    before closing, on a press that assigns URNs to publication formats
    (Rule 12a; Settings bullet 3)
  - the Press editor, Production editor and Site Administrator, offered
    what the Press manager is (Actors rows 2–6; scenario 1)
- **Register carries it**:
  - A1 (availability, terms and "Select Files" offered to the assigned
    assistant roles and refused; Actors rows 3, 5; scenario 3 passes it)
  - A2 (the "Metadata" tab's four lists for the Series editor and the
    assistant roles; Actors row 6)
  - A4 (a remote format unticked stays remote; Rule 5)
  - A5 (a "URL Path" of digits, or one another format uses; Rule 6)
  - A6 (the physical groups on a digital format; Rule 17b; scenario 2
    passes it)
  - A7 ("Date Format" arriving on "YYYYMMDD (H)"; Fields, the date
    window)
  - A8 (the price box's two checks; Rule 15b)
  - A9 (a priced file on a press with no payment method; Side effects,
    "The files readers are offered")
  - A10 (a file's approval changes nothing for readers; Rule 13)
  - A11 (the wording of the unavailable window; Rule 14; scenario 5
    passes it)
  - A12 (the file's "History" lines on approve and revoke; Side effects,
    "A format file's "History"")
  - A13 (the Copyeditor, Marketing and sales coordinator and Funding
    coordinator offered the page without a list; Actors preamble)
  - A14 (a format saved from "Edit" or "Metadata", whose approval or
    availability changes, or whose DOI is emptied on the DOIs page moves
    in the list, and a file's terms or approval move nothing; Fields,
    the page)
  - A15 (a book in the press's second language; Fields, the format
    window)
  - A16 (the "Metadata" tab's close arrow and "Cancel" drop a change;
    Fields, the "Metadata" tab)
  - A17 (page counts and dimensions in free text; Fields, the "Metadata"
    tab)
  - A18 (every unit list offers every unit; Fields, the "Metadata" tab)
  - A19 (the "Select Files" text; Rule 10; scenario 4 passes it)
  - A20 (a "Direct Sales" price of 0; Rule 15d)
  - A21 ("DOI (06)" withheld while the press gives formats no DOIs;
    Rule 18a)
  - A22 ("Role" arriving on "CIP date (35)"; Rule 19a; scenario 2
    passes it)
  - A23 (a refused date, or a "Code Value" of spaces, shows no message
    in its window; Rules 18b, 19b; scenario 2 passes the refused date)
  - A24 (a refused "URL Path" comes back as a notice on the next save;
    Rule 6; scenario 8 passes it)
  - A25 (the French title of the "Format Availability" window; Fields,
    "In French")
- **Owned by another feature**:
  - the "Identifiers" tabs and who is offered them (Actors row 7;
    *[Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)*)
  - "Enable for Publication Formats" and "Enable for Files" ticked
    (Settings bullets 1, 2; *[Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)*)
  - the "URN" plugin with "Publication Formats" or "Files" ticked
    (Settings bullet 3; *[Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)*)

**A1 — The assistant roles are offered availability, terms and file selection, and refused** · 🐞 · medium.
An assigned Layout Editor, Designer, Indexer or Proofreader gets the
full Publication Formats page: they add, edit, delete and approve
formats and upload files. The same row also offers them "Not Available"
/ "Available", each file's terms link and "Select Files", and those
fail. "OK" in "Format Availability" pops up "The current role does not
have access to this operation." and the window stays open, the format
still "Not Available". The terms link opens "Set Terms for Downloading"
holding only that sentence. The "Select Files" window shows "Loading"
where the list belongs, after two pop-ups, "The current role does not
have access to this operation." and "undefined"; its "OK" pops up the
first again and copies nothing. Expected: a control a role cannot use
is not offered, or the role may use it like the rest of the page.

**A3 — A publication format's "Change File" cannot say which file it replaces, so every upload adds one more** · 🐞 · medium.
On a press, a publication format's "Change File" opens "Upload a File
Ready for Publication" with no way to say which of the format's files
is being changed. Whatever is uploaded is added as one more file, and
the file the person meant to replace stays listed beside it.

Readers keep getting the old file until the press sets the new file's
terms (open access, or direct sale with a price). After that, the
book's page lists both files, unless the press deletes the old one.

This affects every format that already holds a file, including the
formats of a published book.

In a remote format's "Edit" tab, unticking "This format will be
available at a separate website." hides "URL of remotely-hosted
content" but keeps the address in it. "OK" then saves the format still
remote. Its name stays a link to the address, and its row offers no
"Change File", so no file can be attached to it. When the editor opens
"Edit" again, the box is ticked.

A press that moves an e-book from another website onto its own files
cannot do it the obvious way, and no message says why.

**A5 — "URL Path" accepts a number or a path already used** · ❓ · minor.
The format's "URL Path" is saved when it is made only of digits, or
when another format of the same version already has it. With two
formats sharing "pdf", the second format's file link on the book's page
answers "404 Not Found" while the first one's opens. A path equal to
another format's number takes that number's addresses over: the other
format's own file link then answers "404 Not Found". A journal's galley
window refuses both, with "The URL path can not be a number." and "The
URL path has already been used and can not be used again.".
Question: should a format's URL Path be refused on the same grounds as a galley's?
Lean: yes; the checks are the galley's, and without them a reader's link breaks.

**A6 — An e-book's "Metadata" tab asks for page counts and dimensions, never for its file size or DRM** · 🐞 · low.
A press editor opens the "Metadata" tab of a digital publication
format, such as a PDF or an e-book whose "Physical format" box is
unticked. The tab asks for "Page Counts", "Returnable Indicator" and
"Physical Dimensions", as it does for a paperback. It never shows
"Digital Information", where the press would enter the e-book's own
file size and its "Digital Technical Protection" (DRM). A format hosted
at another website should show neither the physical groups nor
"Digital Information", but it gets the physical groups too.

So no press can enter an e-book's own file size or its DRM. The
book's ONIX product carries the file size OMP works out from the
format's files, and no DRM statement; a remotely hosted format with
no files gets "0.3" megabytes.

A digital format whose tab has been saved also stores the tab's
preselected physical values, "Canada (CA)" as country of manufacture
and "Yes, returnable, full copies only (Y)". Its ONIX product states
the country, and the returns code for each market it is sold in.

With "Direct Sales" chosen, "Save" is pressable for "10.5" and the save
is refused with "A valid price is required.", while "1,500.00", which
the save would accept, keeps "Save" greyed out. Only a whole number or
exactly two decimals get through (".99" too).
Question: should the price accept one decimal and thousands separators, and should the two checks agree?

**A9 — A press that cannot take payments can put a book file on sale, and readers who open it are turned away without a word** · 🐞 · medium.
A press can set a book file to "Direct Sales" with a price while it
cannot take payments, that is, while it has no currency, or while its
"Manual Fee Payment" has no instructions. The "Set Terms for
Downloading" window saves the price without a word about payments.
Every new press is in this state until it sets up "Payments". A press
that already sells falls into it when it empties its payment
instructions, which the Payments tab saves without a word.

From then on no reader can get the file. A visitor who opens its link
is sent to the Login page, and a signed-in reader to the "Catalog".
Neither page says anything about the file. On a press with a currency
the link still reads "25.00 Purchase PDF (25.00 USD)"; without one it
reads "PDF", like a free file.

The press can get out by filling in "Payments" or by setting the file
back to "Open Access", but nothing on screen tells it that it needs to.

**A13 — On a press, the Copyeditor is offered "Publication Formats", and the page shows a refusal instead of the list** · 🐞 · low.
On a press, the side menu lists "Publication Formats" under a book's
version for roles whose work stops before Production: the Copyeditor
and the Marketing and Sales Coordinator on a book in Copyediting, the
Funding Coordinator on a book in Submission or review, and all three on
a published book. Any custom editorial role without Production in its
stages gets the same entry on a book in one of its stages. Choosing it
shows the page's heading and the version's status, then only "You
don't currently have access to that stage of the workflow." where the
list of formats should be.

The refusal itself is intended: formats and their files are production
material, and OMP 3.4 showed the tab only to roles with Production
access. What is wrong is the menu entry. These roles have no work on
formats, so no work is lost; they meet a page that promises a list and
gives a technical refusal.

**A14 — A format moves in the list when it is saved from "Edit", its approval or availability changes, or its DOI is emptied on the DOIs page** · 🐞 · medium.
The Publication Formats page lists a version's formats in the order
they were added until one of them changes. Saving a format with "OK"
on its "Edit" tab, even with nothing changed, revoking or giving back
its approval, setting it "Not Available" or "Available", or emptying
its DOI on the DOIs page and pressing "Save" can move it to the front,
to the end or between two others, or leave it in place. No change
moves it the same way every time: an unchanged "OK" has put a format
first, left it in place and put it last. The "Metadata" tab's "Save"
moved a format to the front once and left it in place once. Changing a
format's DOI to another value, changing the book's own DOI, a format
file's terms and its "Approve Proof" move nothing. So a book whose
formats were each approved and made available as they were added can
already list them out of that order. Each new order shows at once and
after a reload, and the Author's list, the book's page and the DOIs
page follow it. A press cannot keep its formats in the order it chose,

A press editor sets a book file's terms to "Direct Sales" with a price
of zero, and the save is accepted. The file then reads "Direct Sales"

typed:

- At "0", the "Set Terms for Downloading" window reopens on "Open

- At "0.00", the book page offers "0.00 Purchase PDF (0.00 USD)". A
  signed-in reader gets a payment page that shows no fee. Its only
  action leads back to the same page, so the file stays out of reach.

`APP\controllers\grid\catalogEntry\form\PublicationFormatForm`
(`formatForm.tpl`): group `grid.catalogEntry.publicationFormatDetails`
"Format Details"; `name` multilingual over the press's metadata

toggle is lib/pkp `js/controllers/grid/representations/form/RepresentationFormHandler.js`
(`toggleRemote_()`); leaving with changes is `AjaxFormHandler`'s form
tracking (`form.dataHasChanged`). `execute()` inserts or updates the
format and, for a new one, writes `SUBMISSION_LOG_PUBLICATION_FORMAT_CREATE`.
The harness builds formats through this form (`publicationFormats[]`,
scenarios.md): "Add publication format", the name, "OK". On screen the
in-browser check refuses an empty name first ("This field is
required.", no request sent), so "A name is required." never shows;
that check also asks for the press's primary language (A15).

**f** — `editFormatMetadata()` / `updateFormatMetadata()` build
`APP\controllers\grid\catalogEntry\form\PublicationFormatMetadataForm`
with three arguments, so its `$isPhysicalFormat` stays at the
constructor's default `true` and `$remoteURL` at `null`;
`templates/controllers/tab/catalogEntry/form/publicationMetadataFormFields.tpl`
therefore always includes `physicalPublicationFormat.tpl` and never
`digitalPublicationFormat.tpl` (`{if $isPhysicalFormat}…{elseif
!$remoteURL}`). The form loads the four sub-grids by `load_url_in_div`
(identification codes, sales rights, markets, publication dates), then
`productCompositionCode` (`monograph.publicationFormat.productComposition`,
required, empty default; list 2), `productFormDetailCode`
(`monograph.publicationFormat.productFormDetailCode` "Product Detail
(not required)"; list 175), `productAvailabilityCode`
(`monograph.publicationFormat.productAvailability`, required, default
`20`; list 65), `imprint` (maxlength 255), then the physical groups
(`pageCounts`, `returnInformation` default `Y`, `productDimensions` with
units default `mm` / `gr`, country default `CA`; lists 50, 66, 91).
Validators: `grid.catalogEntry.productAvailabilityRequired`,
`grid.catalogEntry.productCompositionRequired`; a leftover
`directSalesPrice` check for a field the form does not show.
`trackFormChanges: true` in `PublicationFormatMetadataFormHandler.js`.
The form's `inPlaceNotification` asks for
`NOTIFICATION_TYPE_CONFIGURE_PAYMENT_METHOD`, which no code creates (see
note f-a9). On screen the in-browser check refuses an empty "Product
Composition" first ("This field is required.", no request sent), so
"A product composition code must be chosen." never shows; "Product
Availability" has no empty entry, so its check never fires. The
composition list shows alphabetically. Live-probed 2026-09-28: notes

used roles; the custom check compares `count(str_split($date))` with the
format's text stripped of its bracket, and accepts any non-empty date
for a "string" format; message `grid.catalogEntry.dateRequired`). Row
actions: `grid.action.edit`, `grid.action.delete` with
`common.confirmDelete`. On screen the in-browser check refuses an empty
"Code Value" or "Date" first ("This field is required.", no request
sent), so the form's own required check on `value`
(`grid.catalogEntry.valueRequired` "A value is required.") is reached
only by a value of spaces, which the in-browser check lets through
(Rule 18b, note td32). `str_split()` splits
bytes, not characters: "202609é" (7 characters, 8 bytes) was saved as
"YYYYMMDD" and "2026091é" (8 characters) refused. Live-probed

and view-notes while `_canManage` (actions `FileInfoCenterLinkAction`
"More Information", `EditFileLinkAction` "Edit" with the modal title
`grid.action.editFile` "Edit a file", `DeleteFileLinkAction` "Delete"),
plus `dependentFiles` (`submission.dependentFiles` "Dependent Files")
for `application/xml` and `text/html`. The name cell is
`FileNameGridColumn` (number and extension icon, `DownloadFileLinkAction`).
Row actions sit behind the `show_extras` arrow of
`templates/controllers/grid/gridRow.tpl`. The format row's file links:
`AddFileLinkAction` for `SUBMISSION_FILE_PROOF`, whose
`_getTextLabels()` gives the wizard title `submission.upload.proof`
"Upload a File Ready for Publication" and the button
`submission.changeFile` "Change File", and `SelectFilesLinkAction`
(`editor.submission.selectFiles` "Select Files"). The file's status links:

("Awaiting Approval" / "Approved"); terms `editor.monograph.approvedProofs.edit.linkTitle`
"Set Terms", or `payment.directSales.openAccess` "Open Access",

`payment.directSales.notAvailable` "Not Available". OMP's
`ManageFileApiHandler::editMetadata()` shows the "Identifiers" tab of
`templates/controllers/api/file/editMetadata.tpl` for a proof file while
"file" is in `enablePublisherId` or a `pubIds` plugin covers

`approval` and no `urlRemote`); modal title
`grid.catalogEntry.approvedRepresentation.title` "Format Approval",

`templates/frontend/objects/monograph_full.tpl` shows a format's
catalog block only `{if $publicationFormat->getIsApproved()}`;
`templates/frontend/components/downloadLink.tpl` shows
`payment.directSales.purchase` for a priced file; the download refuses a
format that is not available, is remote, or a file with no price.
`PublicationFormat::getBestId()` uses the URL Path. Seed-facts (U44 claim

`manager.maya` (the Press manager), `sectioneditor.ana` (the Series
editor), `layouteditor.leo` (the Layout Editor) and `author.alex` (the
Author, the books' submitter); the visitor is signed out. Scenario 11
runs as `manager.maya` on OJS and OPS `publicknowledge` (Journal Manager,
Preprint Server Manager), its control as `manager.maya` on OMP. Scenarios
6 and 10 run on scratch presses from `POST scenarios/context` with a
throwaway `manager` (the Press manager) and a throwaway `author` (the
books' submitter), passwords the username twice: scenario 6 with
`payments: {enabled: true, currency: 'USD', paymentPluginName:
'ManualPayment'}` and its control on a second scratch press with no
`payments` key; scenario 10 with `enableDois: false`. Every book is a
scratch submission from `POST scenarios/submission` with its press's
Author as `submitter`, `submitted: true` and `decisions:
['skipExternalReview', 'sendToProduction']` (Production); a published
book adds `published: true`. Formats seed through `publicationFormats[]`
(scenarios.md), which builds each one on the screen as `admin` through to
"Approved" and "Available", its file on "Open Access" and still
"Awaiting Approval"; a file there is `genre: 'Book Manuscript'`.
Scenario 1: no format. Scenario 2: `[{name: 'PDF', file:
'article.pdf'}]`. Scenario 3: no format, `participants: [{username:
'sectioneditor.ana', role: 'sectionEditor'}, {username:
'layouteditor.leo', role: 'layoutEditor'}]`. Scenario 4: `files:
[{file: 'replacement.pdf', list: 'productionReady'}]` and "PDF" with
article.pdf. Scenario 5: published, "PDF" with article.pdf and "EPUB"
with replacement.pdf. Scenario 6: `[{name: 'PDF'}]`, no file; its
control's book "PDF" with article.pdf. Scenarios 7 and 9: published,
"PDF" with article.pdf. Scenario 8: `files: [{file: 'article.pdf'}]`,
`chapters: [{title: 'Tides'}]` and "PDF" with replacement.pdf. Scenario
10: `[{name: 'PDF'}]`. Scenario 11: `galleys: [{label: 'PDF', file:

reach Production. The mail catcher of scenario 1 is read after the
job queue has run.
Live-probed 2026-09-28: every throwaway account signed in with its

with the URN plugin on for "Publication Formats", a local format's
window added "URN" and the ticked box "Assign the URN
urn:nbn:de:0000-… to this publication format", and "OK" assigned it; a

first version's page read "No Items". "PDF" renamed from its "Edit"
moved to the end ("EPUB", "Print", "PDF renamed") at once and after a
reload, and the book page's links followed that order; a new version's

format showed "Change File" and "Select Files"; the format's arrow
offered "Edit", "Delete". A file row showed its number in the kind's

"Edit" and "Metadata" on a new press, and with "Identifiers" as well
for a local format on a press with "Enable for Publication Formats" and
URNs for formats on. The bottom "Cancel" closed without asking; the
close arrow with a name typed asked the question as a browser pop-up:
its "Cancel" kept the window and the name, its "OK" closed it and
nothing was saved; with nothing changed the arrow closed at once. A
changed name, then "Metadata", asked the same: "Cancel" stayed on
"Edit" with the change, "OK" moved to "Metadata" and dropped it.

<a id="fn-td10"></a>
**td10** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Fields, the format window, "Name"; A15), two
runs: one box on a one-language press; "English" and "French (Canada)"
boxes on a two-language press, the second shown while the first has
focus. An empty name showed "This field is required." under the box,
the window stayed open and no request was sent. An English book's
format saved with the English name alone and was refused with the
French alone; a French book's was refused with the English alone and
with the French alone.

<a id="fn-td11"></a>
**td11** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Fields, the remote box; Rule 5; A4), two runs,
as the Press manager: ticking the box showed "URL of remotely-hosted
content" and hid "URL Path", emptying it ("abc" gone, still empty after
unticking). The saved remote format's name was a link to its address,
opening in a new tab, with no "Change File" or "Select Files" and "This
item is remotely hosted." under it; its "Edit" had no "Identifiers" tab
where a local format of the same press had one. Unticked and "OK": the
name stayed a link, and reopened the box was ticked with the address.
Control on OJS and OPS: unticking the galley window's box emptied the
address.

<a id="fn-td12"></a>
**td12** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Fields, the "Metadata" tab; Rule 17a; A16),
two runs, as the Press manager: the tab's order as in Fields, ending
"Required fields are marked with an asterisk: *", "Cancel", "Save".
"Save" with "Product Composition" empty sent nothing and showed "This
field is required." under the list; an imprint typed with it was gone
on reopening. "Single-component retail product (00)" › "Save" closed
the window with no notice, and the fields read back on the same page
and after a reload. A changed "Imprint (Brand Name)", then the "Edit"
tab, asked the question: "Cancel" stayed, "OK" switched and dropped the
change. The close arrow and the tab's "Cancel" closed without asking
and kept nothing, while the close arrow did ask for a changed "Edit"
tab field. "Product Availability" at "Available (20)" and at "Not yet
available (10)" left the "Availability" column as it was; 300
characters typed in "Imprint (Brand Name)" left 255.

<a id="fn-td13"></a>
**td13** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 17b; A6), two runs: on "PDF" ("Physical
format" unticked), "Print" (ticked) and a remote format, the tab showed
"Page Counts", "Returnable Indicator" and "Physical Dimensions", and
none of "Digital Information", "File Size in Mbytes", "Digital
Technical Protection" or "Enter your own file size value?".

<a id="fn-td14"></a>
**td14** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Fields, the code and date windows; Rules 19,
19a, 19b; A7, A22, A23), two runs, as the Press manager. "Add
publication date": "Date*", "Date Format*" on "YYYYMMDD (H)", "Role*"
on "CIP date (35)" (21 roles, alphabetical), "Cancel", "OK", then
"Required fields are marked with an asterisk: *". "YYYYMMDD" refused
"2026091" and took "20260915"; "YYYY" refused "20261" and took "2026";
"YYYYMMDD (H)" took "20261001"; "Text string" took "hello";
"abcdefgh" was saved as "YYYYMMDD". A refused date: no message six
seconds later, the window open with the required-fields line twice;
the message came with the next "Publication Date added.". An empty
"Date": "This field is required." under the box, no request. After a
date with "Publication date (01)", the next "Add publication date" no
longer offered it and arrived on the next unused role; that row's
"Edit" offered and preselected it. A date typed without touching the
lists was stored as "YYYYMMDD (H)" and "CIP date (35)", and the book's
Native XML export carried it as `<onix:Date dateformat="20">20261001</onix:Date>`
with the role 35. "Edit" › "OK" showed "Publication Date edited.";
"Delete" asked with the delete dialog and showed "Publication Date
removed.".

<a id="fn-td15"></a>
**td15** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rules 15b, 15d; A8, A20), two runs, as the
Press manager with "Direct Sales" chosen: "Save" stayed greyed for an
empty box, "abc" and "1,500.00" (a press did nothing, no request);
"10.50", "25.00", ".99" and " 10" were saved (reopened "10.50",
"25.00", ".99", "10"); "10.5" and "-5" left "Save" pressable and were
refused with "A valid price is required.", the window open with "Errors
occurred processing this form" at its top, the link unchanged after a
reload. "0" was saved: the link read "Direct Sales" after a reload and
the window reopened on "Open Access"; on the published book a
visitor's link opened the file's view page with no sign-in.

<a id="fn-td16"></a>
**td16** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 6; A5), two runs, as the Press manager:
refused with the message under the box, the window open and nothing
saved: "my pdf", "-pdf", "a/b", "a..b", "pdf."; saved: "123", "pdf",
and "pdf" again on a second format of the same version; no notice at the
moment of either (the notices a later save shows: A24). On the book's page, with "pdf" on two formats the first's
file view page opened and the second's answered "404 Not Found"; with
the second's path set to the first's number and the first's path
emptied, the second's opened and the first's answered "404 Not Found".
OJS and OPS galley windows refused a number with "The URL path can not
be a number." and a used path with "The URL path has already been used
and can not be used again.".

<a id="fn-td17"></a>
**td17** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 7), two runs, as the Press manager: the
two boxes stored the rows "ISBN-13 (15)" and "ISBN-10 (Discontinued)";
the "ISBN-13 (15)" row edited to "9780000000002" in the list showed in
the 13-digit box when the "Edit" tab was opened again, an unchanged
"OK" kept it, an emptied 10-digit box removed its row and a changed
13-digit box replaced the row's value; "not an isbn" in the 13-digit
box was stored as the code.

<a id="fn-td18"></a>
**td18** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 9; A3), two runs, as the Press manager:
the wizard "Upload a File Ready for Publication", steps "1. Upload
File", "2. Review Details", "3. Confirm"; step 1 held "Submission
Component*", "Drag and drop a file here to begin upload", "Upload File"
and "Continue", greyed until a file was added. Three uploads
(article.pdf, replacement.pdf, article.html) listed three files, each
"Awaiting Approval" and "Set Terms", newest first, none replaced, no
notice.

<a id="fn-td19"></a>
**td19** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 10; A19), two runs, as the Press manager:
the window's title and text as quoted, "Page Proofs" with the columns
"Select", "Name", "Component", the production-ready file under
"Production", unticked; the buttons "Close", "Cancel", "OK" and no
"Search". Ticking "Show files from all accessible workflow stages."
reloaded the list at once with every stage. "OK" with the file ticked:
no notice, the copy listed under a new number, "Awaiting Approval",
"Set Terms"; "Production Ready Files" still listed the source; a second
"Select Files" showed it unticked and "OK" added a second copy. The
close arrow with a file ticked closed the window at once, with no
question, and the rows stayed as they were.

<a id="fn-td20"></a>
**td20** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 13; Side effects, "Activity Log" and "A
format file's "History""; A12), two runs, as the Press manager: "Approve
Proof" and "Revoke Proof Approval" with their texts and "Cancel", "OK";
the row read "Approved", then "Awaiting Approval", at once and after a
reload, with no notice. The file's "History" held two lines after the
upload, four after the approval and six after the revoke, each press
adding 'The metadata for file "article.pdf" was edited by {username}.'
and '"Kim Manager" ({username}) has signed off on the signoff for
"article.pdf."'; the book's Activity Log gained the first line per
press. A format's creation, approval, revoked approval, availability,
withdrawn availability and deletion each added one Activity Log line
("…is no longer published." and "…is no longer available." among them;
the created and removed lines print "{$formatName}", a finding of
Submission activity log & notes); a refused availability added none.

<a id="fn-td21"></a>
**td21** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 14; A11), two runs, as the Press manager
and the assigned Series editor: "Format Availability" with both texts
as quoted and "OK" before "Cancel"; "OK" set "Available", then "Not
Available", at once and after a reload; "Cancel" sent nothing. A format
"Awaiting Approval" was made available, and a format approved while
"Not Available" stayed so until made available.

<a id="fn-td22"></a>
**td22** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rules 15a, 15c; Fields, the terms window), two
runs, as the Press manager: a new file's window opened on "Not
Available", the box empty and greyed; "Save" unchanged turned the link
to "Not Available", on the same page and after a reload. "Direct
Sales" at "25.00" reopened with "25.00"; "Open Access" and "Not
Available" reopened with the box empty. "12.00" typed, then "Open
Access" or "Not Available", stayed in the greyed box and was editable
again on "Direct Sales". "Cancel" with a change asked nothing and the
link was unchanged; the close arrow with a change asked the question,
and its "OK" closed the window and dropped the change.

<a id="fn-td23"></a>
**td23** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 16), two runs: on a published book the
Press manager revoked an approval, edited a format, made one
unavailable, set terms, added a format and a file, added and approved a
remote format and deleted a format; each change read back after a
reload and on the book's page right after. The assigned Layout Editor
and Series editor got the page with "Add publication format" and the
three columns, and the Layout Editor approved a format there. The texts
above the list read as quoted, the Author's included.

<a id="fn-td24"></a>
**td24** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 18; Settings bullet 4; A21), two runs, as
the Press manager: "Add Code" opened "Add Code" with "Code Value*",
"ONIX Code Type*" (alphabetical, on "ARK (35)", no empty entry),
"Cancel", "OK". On a new press (DOIs on, "Monographs" the only item
with DOIs) and on one with "Publication Formats" among "Items with
DOIs": 21 types, no "DOI (06)", "ISBN-10 (Discontinued)" present; with
DOIs off: 22 types, "DOI (06)" offered. "ISBN-13 (15)" with
"9780000000002" › "OK" added the row and "Identification Code added.";
"Add Code" then no longer offered "ISBN-13 (15)", while the row's
"Edit" offered and preselected it; "Identification Code edited.";
"Delete" asked with the delete dialog, "Cancel" kept the row, "OK"
removed it with "Identification Code removed.". An empty "Code Value":
"This field is required." under the box, no request. "not-an-isbn" was
saved as "ISBN-10 (Discontinued)". A code added, then the tab left by
"Cancel", was kept.

<a id="fn-td25"></a>
**td25** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 20; Side effects, "Files deleted"), two
runs, as the Press manager: the dialog titled "Delete" with its text,
"OK", "Cancel"; "Cancel" changed nothing, after a reload too; "OK"
removed the format and its file with "Publication Format removed.".
The file left a chapter window's "Files" list (six entries before,
five after); "Production Ready Files" was unchanged, the file never
having been there. The deleted file's download link then answered "The
current user is not authorized to access the specified submission
file.". The codes and other lists going with the format is note m's.

<a id="fn-td26"></a>
**td26** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 21), two runs, as the Press manager:
after "Create New Version" the new version listed "PDF" ("Paperback /
softback (BC)", "Approved", "Available") with its file under a new
number ("Approved", "Open Access"), and the remote "Web" with its
address, "Awaiting Approval" and "Not Available". The copy's "Edit"
reopened with its kind, "Physical format" ticked, its URL Path and
ISBN-13, and its "Metadata" listed the "ISBN-13 (15)" code. Renaming
the copy left the first version's "PDF" unchanged.

<a id="fn-td27"></a>
**td27** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Side effects, "Notices" and "No email"), two
runs, as the Press manager: notices "Publication Format removed.",
"Identification Code added." and "Identification Code edited."; none on
"Add publication format" › "OK", "Edit" › "OK", two uploads, "Select
Files" › "OK", both approvals, availability, terms "Save" and
"Metadata" › "Save". After all of these and a drained job queue the
mail catcher held nothing for the book's Author, the Press manager, the
Series editor or the Layout Editor, and the Press manager's "Tasks"
count was unchanged.

<a id="fn-td28"></a>
**td28** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Side effects, "What readers see" and "The files
readers are offered"; A9, A10, A20), two runs and a third for the
reader side, as a visitor and as a signed-in Reader on published
books. Listed: an available format with an "Open Access" file, whether
that file read "Approved" or "Awaiting Approval" (a file uploaded on
screen and never approved too); a remote available format, as a link
to its address; a format with the URL Path "pdf", its link
`…/catalog/view/{book}/pdf/{file}` opening its view page. Not listed: a
"Not Available" format; an available format whose one file was "Not
Available"; one whose file had no terms. An "Approved", available
format with an ISBN showed "Details about the available publication
format: {name}" with "ISBN-13 (15) 9780000000002"; an available one
"Awaiting Approval" showed no such block. A "Direct Sales" file at
"25.00": on a press with "US Dollar" and "Manual Fee Payment" set up
the link read "25.00 Purchase PDF (25.00 USD)", a visitor was sent to
Login and a signed-in Reader got "Manual Fee Payment", its instructions
and "Fee 25.00 (USD)"; on a new press (no currency, no payment method)
the link read "PDF", a visitor was sent to Login and a signed-in Reader
to the catalog, with no message. Which of the currency and the payment
method decides the link's wording was not separated. Every file's view
page opened; its download failed (note p).

<a id="fn-td29"></a>
**td29** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Settings bullet 3; Rule 12a), two runs: a new
press lists "URN" unticked, and its "Settings" window offers
"Monographs", "Chapters", "Publication Formats", "Files". With
"Publication Formats" and "Files": the format window's "Identifiers",
"Format Approval"'s URN step, "Edit a file"'s "Identifiers", and
"Approve Proof" reading "URN" with the ticked box "Assign the URN
urn:nbn:de:0000-… to this file". A press with URNs for "Files" alone,
built through the tooling because the window refuses to save it
(Identifiers, its OMP1), showed the same on its files and no URN step
on its formats.

<a id="fn-td30"></a>
**td30** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Settings bullet 5; Fields, the terms window),
two runs: "Price ()" on a new press, "Price (USD)" on a press with "US
Dollar" saved. On a new press Settings › Distribution › "Payments"
shows only the unticked "Enable"; "Currency" appears once it is ticked.
The seeded press was not changed; a scratch press stood in for "a new
press".

<a id="fn-td31"></a>
**td31** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Fields, the terms window; A9), two runs, as the
Press manager on a new press (no payment method) and on one with a
payment method set up: the window's text and choices as quoted, and no
notice about a payment method in the window or in the format's
"Metadata" tab, before and after saving "Direct Sales" at "25.00".

<a id="fn-td32"></a>
**td32** — Walked 2026-10-03 (Rule 18b; A23), OMP `main`, as `dbarnes`
on PKP's default test dataset: submission 4's format "PDF" › "Edit" ›
"Metadata" › "Add Code" (the kept walk
`shared/playwright/checks/issues/catalog-windows-refuse-without-message/walk.js`
with `MODE=reach`, its step `r3-code-value-space`). A "Code Value" of
one space › "OK": the window stayed open with no message in it and none
at the top right, the box emptied, one more "Required fields are marked
with an asterisk: *" line under the form, and no row added; a good value
then saved, and the refusal's notice came with that save. The request
trims the value to nothing (`PKPRequest::getUserVars()`), so the form's
required check on `value` refuses it. Walked again 2026-10-07 (the same
walk, steps `r3-code-value-space` and `r4-code-good`; OMP `main` at omp
`0c6a3ebed1`, the default dataset freshly reset) for the late notice's
words: the same refusal, then the good save closed the window and two
notices showed, "A value is required." and "Identification Code added."
(the page's notification fetch after the save: a `general` pair, "Errors
occurred processing this form: A value is required." and "Notification:
Identification Code added."). The words are
`grid.catalogEntry.valueRequired` in OMP's `locale/en/locale.po` on
`main` and `stable-3_5_0`. `stable-3_5_0` was read in the code, where
`codeForm.tpl` and `IdentificationCodeForm.php` are the same files.

<a id="fn-f-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — Notes c and j. `setAvailable`, `editApprovedProof` and
`saveApprovedProof` lack `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT`, while the cell provider
renders both links for any `_canManage` user; `selectFiles` includes the
assistant role but the list inside (`ManageProofFilesGridHandler`) does
not. Every refusal answered with `status: false`, no server error.

one file uploaded per galley in OJS"). A journal's or preprint server's
galley has its own "Change File" in the row's "More Actions" menu
("Edit", "Change File", "More Information", "Delete"), which replaces
the galley's one file (Submission files), live-probed 2026-09-28 on OJS

<a id="fn-f-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — Note e. `RepresentationFormHandler::toggleRemote_()` empties
`input[id^="urlRemote"]` on untick, but the box's id is `remoteURL`, so
nothing is emptied; `PublicationFormatForm::execute()` stores
`urlRemote` whenever `remoteURL` is posted non-empty, and a hidden input
is still posted. A journal's galley window empties it (Galleys, its
Fields).

**f-a6** — Note f. Introduced by pkp/pkp-lib#2072 (omp `ce205d583`,
2019-08-21, "Implement versioning and split publications from
submissions"), which added `editFormatMetadata()` passing three
arguments; before it the catalog-entry tab passed the format's physical

digital formats (`MonographONIX30XmlFilter`).

<a id="fn-f-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — Note g. `PublicationDateForm::fetch()` assigns
`'dateFormat' => '20'` with the comment "YYYYMMDD Onix code as a
default"; in the shipped list 55, `00` is "YYYYMMDD" and `20` is
"YYYYMMDD (H)" (Hijri). The preset dates from omp `a92b2dd34`
(2012-01-12); the comment shows plain YYYYMMDD was meant, so it reads as
a slip, not a choice.

**f-a13** — Note c. `useWorkflowNavigationConfigOMP.js` adds
`publicationFormats` to the side menu with no Production check

policy refuses a role without Production access. Live-probed
2026-09-28: note c's probe line, two runs.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#804](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/804) ([docs/issues/U73-A13-copyeditor-formats-page-no-list.md](../issues/U73-A13-copyeditor-formats-page-no-list.md)).

<a id="fn-f-a14"></a>
**f-a14** — Note d: every format is created with `seq` 0 and the list
is ordered by `seq` alone, so the database decides the order (the test
install runs PostgreSQL). Live-probed 2026-09-28: note td7. Live-probed
2026-09-29 (Fields, the page; A14), two runs, as the Press manager, one
published book per case with the formats Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and
Delta, each holding article.pdf on "Open Access", "Approved" and
"Available", the case acting on Bravo; the order read at once, after a
reload and on the book's page. Bravo's "Edit" › "OK" with nothing
changed: last, both runs. Approval revoked: last three times of four,
once third ("Charlie, Delta, Bravo, Alpha" from "Bravo, Charlie, Delta,
Alpha"). "Not Available": first three times of four, once last (the
book's page then without Bravo). Approval given back: first once, back
to second once; availability given back: still first once, back to
second once. A file's terms saved unchanged and then set to "Direct
Sales" at 10.00, a file's "Approve Proof", and two reloads with no
action: no move. The three reads agreed every time, and the Author's
list matched the manager's order in four reads. One book of sixteen
listed "Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Alpha" before any action: the seeding
approves each format and makes it available through the same windows.
The two different six-format orders of 2026-09-28 fit such moves.
Live-probed 2026-09-30 (Fields, the page; A14), two runs and a shorter
third, as the Press manager on a press giving DOIs to monographs and
publication formats, the same four-format book per case; the order read
at once, after a reload, on the DOIs page's expanded view, on the
book's page and as the Author. Bravo's "Edit" › "OK" with nothing
changed: first three times in each run; in the third run first, then
in place, then last. A changed name: first, both runs. "Metadata" ›
"Save" after choosing "Product Composition": first once, in place once;
a second "Save" unchanged: no move. Approval revoked: first four times
of four; given back: no move. "Not Available": first twice, third once,
last once; "Available" again: from third to last once, last kept once.
Bravo's DOI emptied on the DOIs page (a `POST` with
`X-Http-Method-Override: DELETE` to `/api/v1/dois/{id}`): first, all
three runs. Typed back into the emptied box (`POST /api/v1/dois`, then
`PUT /api/v1/_dois/publicationFormats/{id}`): stayed first. Changed to
another value (`PUT /api/v1/dois/{id}` alone), the book's own DOI
changed, and "Save" with nothing changed (no request): no move. A
file's terms and "Approve Proof": no move. Every save on the DOIs page
showed "DOI(s) successfully updated". The four reads agreed every time,
and the rows' physical order in `publication_formats` matched them;
every `seq` read 0, and a step that moved a format had rewritten its
row. One book of thirty listed "Charlie, Delta, Alpha, Bravo" before
any action.

<a id="fn-f-a20"></a>
**f-a20** — Note j: "Direct Sales" at 0 stores `salesType`
`directSales` with `directSalesPrice` 0; the link shows the sales type,
the window's opening logic reads a price of 0 as "Open Access", and the
book's page offers a file whose price is 0 as free. Live-probed

Live-probed 2026-09-28: note td24.

<a id="fn-f-a22"></a>
**f-a22** — Note g: the roles are ONIX list 163 minus the format's used
ones, with no preset and no empty entry, so the browser selects the
first. Live-probed 2026-09-28: note td14 (the book's export carried the
role as 35).

<a id="fn-f-a23"></a>
**f-a23** — Note g (the custom length check, `grid.catalogEntry.dateRequired`).
Live-probed 2026-09-28: note td14. The code window: note td32
(`IdentificationCodeGridHandler::updateCode()` answers a refusal with
the form drawn again, and `codeForm.tpl` gives "Code Value" no place for
a message and puts the required-fields line after `</form>`, so the
redraw adds one).

<a id="fn-f-a24"></a>
**f-a24** — Test run 2026-09-28 (OMP suite, scenario 8, as the Press
manager): after "my pdf" and "a/b" were refused in "PDF"'s "Edit" window
and "print-edition" saved, the window closed and the page's notice area
held two notices "This may only contain letters, numbers, dashes,
underscores and periods.", each with "Close". Each refused "OK" answered
200 with the form again (`update-format`); the page's
`notification/fetchNotification` after the saving "OK" returned two
`general` notifications titled "Errors occurred processing this form",
class `notifyFormError`, with that message. The refused date of A23
arrives the same way. Evidence: `.reports/U73/tomp/`.

<a id="fn-f-a25"></a>
**f-a25** — Notes d, e. OMP's `locale/fr_CA/locale.po` holds "Approbation
du format" for `grid.catalogEntry.availableRepresentation.title`, the
text of 2013, when the window's English title was also "Format
Approval"; the English became "Format Availability" in 2015 (omp
`b9affacac`) and `locale/fr/locale.po` reads "Disponibilité du format".
`PublicationFormatGridCellProvider::getCellActions()` titles the window
with it whether the format is made available or taken back (code; only
making it available was opened). Walked 2026-10-04 on `main` and
`stable-3_5_0`, on PKP's default dataset, as `dbarnes` on submission 4's
format "PDF": the window read "Approbation du format" over "Ce format
sera accessible aux lecteurs. …", and was cancelled. The same entries
stand on `stable-3_4_0` and `stable-3_3_0` (code, 2026-10-08). The
page's other French (Canada) texts that show as raw codes (the
"Availability" column heading, the format window's remote box and ISBN
lines, the "Format Approval" window) are texts the language lacks, and
no finding; they were live-probed 2026-09-30, two runs, on a scratch
press with English and French (Canada) as interface languages, every
French read paired with the same read in English.
