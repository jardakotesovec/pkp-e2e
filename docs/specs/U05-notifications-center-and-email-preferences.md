# Notifications center & email preferences

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

This spec is about how the application tells a person that something
happened, and how that person controls it. It covers four surfaces that
every signed-in user meets, whatever their role:

- the **Tasks panel**: the bell in the editorial header, with a red count of
  unread tasks, opening a window headed "Tasks" that lists the tasks the
  application has raised for this account across every journal;
- the **message at the top right** of an editorial page after an action
  ("Your changes have been saved." and its warning and error cousins), a
  *toast*;
- the **choices on the Profile page's "Notifications" tab**: for every
  event type, whether the event reaches this account at all in this
  journal, and whether it also arrives by email;
- the **Unsubscribe page** that the footer link of a notification email
  opens, where the addressee switches off notification emails without
  signing in.

*Editorial pages* here are the pages under the Dashboard, whose header
carries the bell and, under the signed-in name at the top right, "Edit
Profile" (the Profile page); *reader-facing pages* are the journal's
public site, with "Dashboard" and "View Profile" under the signed-in
name.

The tab as a screen, "Save" included, is described in
[User profile](U03-user-profile.md) (its Rule 11 and scenario 10), and each
event type belongs to the feature that raises it (Rule 6 names each). This
spec owns the delivery: the task, the toast, the email footer, the person's
choices and the Unsubscribe page.

## Actors & permissions

"The account holder" is the signed-in user; the Tasks panel and the
Notifications tab always act on that account, and no address opens another
person's. "The addressee" of an email is the account the email was sent to;
the Unsubscribe page acts on the addressee, whoever opens it. A "task" is
one row in the Tasks panel. A *manager-level role* is one of the roles
whose permission level on Settings › Users & Roles › "Roles" is the
Journal Manager's
([→ manager-level roles](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md#settings-access)):
on a default journal the Journal Manager, the Editor and the Production
Editor; on a press the Press Manager, the Press Editor and the Production
Editor; on a preprint server the Preprint Server Manager alone. <sup>e</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Open the Tasks panel** | • Any signed-in user on an editorial page, whatever their roles, including a user with no role in that journal, a user with no role in any journal, and the Site Administrator (Rule 2). The panel lists the account holder's own tasks only; what one Journal Manager deletes leaves another's rows untouched <sup>a</sup> |
| **Mark tasks read or new, delete tasks** | • The account holder, on their own list only (Rule 3) <sup>a</sup> |
| **See the unread count on the reader-side header** | • A signed-in user holding, in the journal, a role whose permission level (Settings › Users & Roles › "Roles", column "Permission level") is Journal Manager, Assistant, Reviewer or Author (on a default journal the Journal Manager, the Editor, the Production Editor, every assistant-level role, the Translator, the Reviewer and the Author), or the Site Administrator, on a journal whose only "Forms" language is English (Rule 4a); the count shows even when it is "0"<br>• The same roles on a journal with French under "Forms": beside the name nobody; only a window narrower than 992 px shows the number, after "Dashboard" [A15](#a15) (Rule 4c)<br>• On the site's own home page, in a window 992 px or wider, nobody: every name is bare, and the "Dashboard" entry under the Site Administrator's name carries the number without displaying it [A13](#a13); in a narrower window the Site Administrator sees it after "Dashboard" (Rule 4d)<br>• A user whose roles in the journal are all at the Section Editor permission level (a Section Editor, {OJS} a Guest Editor) sees their name without a count, with or without unread tasks ⚠ [A3](#a3); a Reader sees the bare name too <sup>c</sup> |
| **Choose which events reach them, and which by email** | • The account holder, per journal, on the Profile page's "Notifications" tab (Rule 5) <sup>d</sup> |
| **Open the Unsubscribe page and unsubscribe** | • Whoever holds the emailed link, signed in or not; the page names and acts on the addressee, not on whoever is signed in (Rule 8, scenario 6) <sup>f</sup> |
| **Receive a task or a notification email** | • Decided per event type by the feature that raises it; the roster in Rule 6 says who is told, where it shows and whether an email goes out <sup>e</sup> |

## Fields & validation

**Profile › "Notifications" tab.** The tab opens with one sentence, its
only explanation of the two boxes: "Select the system events that you wish
to be notified about. Unchecking an item will prevent notifications of the
event from showing up in the system and also from being emailed to you.
Checked events will appear in the system and you have an extra option to
receive or not the same notification by email." Under it the event types
are listed in four groups, headed "Public Announcements", "Submission
Events", "Reviewing Events" and "Editors", in this order. Each row is the
event's sentence, followed by the two boxes named below. Where the row's
sentence would name a submission, the tab shows the word "Title" in its
place. Where a row's wording differs by application, the versions share one line,
separated by "·". Every role is offered the same groups and rows: an Author
or a Reader sees the "Editors" group too. <sup>d</sup>

| Group | Rows, in order |
|-------|----------------|
| "Public Announcements" | "A new announcement has been created." {OJS OPS} · "New announcement." {OMP}<br>"An issue has been published." {OJS}<br>"An issue has been made open access." {OJS} |
| "Submission Events" | "A new article, "Title," has been submitted." {OJS} · "A new monograph, "Title," has been submitted." {OMP} · "A new preprint , "Title", has been submitted." {OPS} ⚠ [OPS2](#ops2)<br>"A new version of your submission, "Title", was published."<br>"A new article has been submitted to which an editor needs to be assigned." {OJS} · "A new monograph has been submitted to which an editor needs to be assigned." {OMP} · "A new preprint has been submitted to which a moderator needs to be assigned." {OPS}<br>"Discussion added."<br>"Discussion activity." ⚠ [A1](#a1) |
| "Reviewing Events" | "A reviewer has commented on "Title"." (listed on a preprint server too ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1)) |
| "Editors" | "Weekly email of outstanding tasks" (the email is monthly; *[Submissions dashboard](U23-submissions-dashboard.md#a8)* records the mislabel)<br>"Statistics report summary." — only while the journal's editorial statistics email is on (Settings), and never on the site-level profile |

| Box (UI label, under every row) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Enable these types of notifications." | — | Ticked by default. Unticked, the event is not raised for this account in this journal (Rule 5a; one email ignores the box ⚠ [A10](#a10)). Unticking it greys out the email box below it, whose tick is dropped on save (Rule 5c) |
| "Do not send me an email for these types of notifications." | — | Unticked by default. Ticked, the event still reaches the account in the application but sends no email (Rule 5b). Greyed out while "Enable these types of notifications." is unticked |

**The Unsubscribe page** (Rule 8): under the heading "Unsubscribe" and the
sentence "Select the emails that you no longer wish to receive at {email}
from {journal name}.", one box for every row the tab ever shows, each
labelled with the row's sentence (the word "Title" itself where the tab has
it), without group headings and in the page's own order, given below; then
the sentence "You can resubscribe to email notifications at any time from
your user profile." with "user profile" as a link, and a button
"Unsubscribe". Every box is ticked when the page opens, whatever the
person's tab holds ⚠ [A2](#a2). The boxes, in order:

- {OJS} "An issue has been published." · "An issue has been made open
  access." · "A new article, "Title," has been submitted." · "A new version
  of your submission, "Title", was published." · "A new article has been
  submitted to which an editor needs to be assigned." · "A reviewer has
  commented on "Title"." · "Discussion added." · "Discussion activity." ·
  "A new announcement has been created." · "Weekly email of outstanding
  tasks" · "Statistics report summary."
- {OMP OPS} the same list without the two issue boxes, so the submission
  box comes first (worded per application as on the tab) and the
  announcement box seventh ("New announcement." on a press).

The list is the same on every journal: the "Statistics report summary." box
is listed even where the journal's statistics email is off ⚠ [A9](#a9).
<sup>f</sup>

**The Tasks panel** (Rule 2): a full-height panel over the page with a
back-arrow button "Close" (the Escape key closes the panel too) and the
heading "Tasks"; inside it a table with the columns "Select" (a box at
the start of every row and none in the header, so no box ticks every row
at once) and "Tasks", the three actions "Mark New", "Mark Read" and
"Delete" under the table (offered even while the list is empty), and a line counting the rows ("0 - 0 of 0
items" on an empty list). No text can be typed anywhere in the panel.
<sup>a</sup>

## Rules & state

1. **Four ways a notification reaches a person.** An event may produce any
   of these, and the roster in Rule 6 says which:
   - a *toast*: a short message at the top right of the editorial page
     the person is on, gone after a few seconds (Rule 9);
   - a *task*: a row in the Tasks panel, shown as unread until read
     (Rule 2). It stays until the person deletes it, except the "needs an
     editor" task (Rule 6), which leaves every manager's list once a
     Section Editor is assigned to the submission with "Assign" on its
     Participants panel;
   - a *notice on a screen*: a sentence or box that another feature's screen
     shows while a situation lasts (the review round's status box, the
     "awaiting approval" notice); those belong to the screen's own spec;
   - an *email*, most of them with an Unsubscribe link in the footer
     (Rule 7).
   The choices on the Notifications tab govern tasks and emails (Rule 5).
   Toasts and the screens' own notices are never subject to a choice.
   <sup>e</sup>
2. **The Tasks panel.** <sup>a</sup>
   - 2a. **The bell.** Every editorial page's header carries a bell icon
     (its hidden name for screen readers is "Tasks", and "Tasks 1", "Tasks
     2" and so on while there are unread tasks). While the account has
     unread tasks, a red badge on the bell shows their number as it stood
     when the page loaded; a task raised while the page is open shows on
     the next page the person opens. While the
     Tasks window is open the bell stays in the header greyed out, cannot
     be pressed and shows no badge; the moment the window is closed the
     badge shows the current number again.
   - 2b. **The window.** Pressing the bell opens the Tasks panel described
     in Fields over the page. It lists the account's tasks newest first
     under the column headed "Tasks", by the moment each task was raised;
     two tasks raised within the same second come in either order
     ⚠ [A12](#a12). Each row shows the task's sentence and, under it, the
     title of the submission it is about when the task carries one: the
     "needs an editor" task does; the published-version task names the
     title inside its sentence and shows nothing under it; the statistics
     task ("This is a kind reminder for you to check your publication's
     health through the editorial report.", Rule 6) is about no
     submission and shows nothing under it. An unread
     row's sentence is bold; a read row's is in regular
     type, with no other marker. When the account holds roles in more than
     one journal, each row also shows the journal's initials (the "Journal
     Initials" typed on the Create Journal form; "Press Initials" on a
     press, "Server Initials" on a preprint server) between the sentence
     and the title (Rule 2d). With no task at all the list reads "No Items".
     Beyond 25 rows the list is paged: the line under the table then reads
     "1 - 25 of 26 items" with page numbers and ">" and ">>" after it, and
     offers "Items per page:" with the choices "10", "25", "50", "75" and
     "100".
   - 2c. **Opening a task.** A row's text (the sentence and, where there
     is one, the title under it) is one link as wide as the "Tasks"
     column, the blank space beside the text included. Only the row's
     last few pixels above its bottom border, and the "Select" cell around
     its box, do nothing. Pressing the link anywhere marks the task read
     and leaves the window for the submission the task is about: {OJS OMP} the submissions dashboard opens with that
     submission's workflow in a panel over the list, headed with the
     author's name and the submission's title under it; {OPS} the browser
     lands instead on a reader-facing page whose whole text is "A workflow
     stage was not specified.", and the submission is not reached
     ⚠ [OPS3](#ops3). The task is marked read either way. The statistics
     task is the exception, on every application: pressing it marks it
     read and opens the journal's Statistics › "Editorial Activity" page
     ([Editorial statistics](U65-editorial-statistics.md#monthly-email)
     Rule 27).
   - 2d. **The list is per account, not per journal.** It pools every
     journal's tasks, and the same window with the same rows opens from
     any journal's editorial pages and from the site-level Profile page
     (Rule 5d), which carries the same bell.
3. **Mark Read, Mark New, Delete.** Each acts on the rows whose box is
   ticked and on nothing else; with no box ticked, pressing any of the three
   changes nothing. "Mark Read" turns the ticked rows into read rows and
   "Mark New" turns them back into unread rows; "Delete" removes the ticked
   rows at once, with no confirmation and no way back. After each action
   every box is unticked again, and once the window is closed the badge on
   the bell shows the new number of unread rows. <sup>a</sup>
4. **The reader-side count.** It is a count only: the reader-side header
   offers no list. Actors says who sees it; a Section Editor, {OJS} a
   Guest Editor and a Reader see the bare name, with or without unread
   tasks [A3](#a3). <sup>c</sup>
   - 4a. **Beside the name.** On a journal's reader-facing pages, in a
     window 992 px or wider, a signed-in user's name in the header is
     followed by the number of unread tasks the bell shows, as "{name} 1"
     with one and "{name} 0" with none, every journal's tasks counted.
   - 4b. **In a narrower window.** Below 992 px the header shows an "Open
     Menu" button in place of its menus. Pressing it lists the signed-in
     user's name, bare, with "Dashboard", "View Profile" and "Logout" under
     it, and the number follows "Dashboard" ("Dashboard 2", "Dashboard
     0").
   - 4c. **With French under "Forms".** On a journal whose "Forms"
     languages ([→ "Forms"](U57-languages-and-locales.md#form-languages))
     include French, no name carries the number, whatever the role. In a
     window 992 px or wider the journal's public pages then show it
     nowhere, while the bell on the editorial pages still counts the
     tasks; a narrower window shows it after "Dashboard" as in 4b
     ⚠ [A15](#a15). Unticking French under "Forms" brings the number back
     beside the name on the next page opened.
   - 4d. **The site's own home page.** Every name is bare, the Site
     Administrator's included. In a window 992 px or wider the "Dashboard"
     entry in the list under the Site Administrator's name reads
     "Dashboard" alone: the number is written after it in the page's
     source but not displayed ⚠ [A13](#a13). In a narrower window that
     entry displays it ("Dashboard 2"). A Journal Manager, even one with
     roles in two journals, has a bare "Dashboard" entry there at either
     width.
5. **What the Notifications tab's boxes do.** <sup>d</sup>
   - 5a. **"Enable these types of notifications." unticked** means the
     event is not raised for this account in this journal: no task, and
     no announcement, issue or statistics email. One email ignores the
     box: the "needs an editor" email still arrives with "Enable…"
     unticked, and only its
     "Do not send me an email…" box stops it ⚠ [A10](#a10). Nothing is
     stored for later; re-ticking the box brings back future events only.
   - 5b. **"Do not send me an email for these types of notifications."
     ticked** means the event still produces its task, where it has one,
     but the email that would accompany it is not sent to this account. For events
     whose email is optional for the sender (an announcement posted without
     its email box), the choice only matters when the sender chose to email.
   - 5c. **Unticking "Enable…" clears the email choice.** The email box
     greys out at once, keeping whatever tick it had; "Save" records it as
     unticked, and it shows unticked on the tab's next load. Re-ticking
     "Enable…" later leaves the email box unticked, so the event's emails
     come again until it is ticked once more.
   - 5d. **The choices are kept per journal.** The tab saves for the journal
     it was opened in, and each journal on a site keeps its own set. The
     site-level profile keeps yet another set. Its address is the journal's
     profile address with "index" in place of the journal's path, for
     example "…/index/user/profile" (*[User profile](U03-user-profile.md)*
     Rule 3); the site's home page has the same "index", and its "View
     Profile" under the signed-in name leads to the site-level profile. A
     user with a role in exactly one journal who opens that address is
     sent to that journal's profile, on the tab the address names
     (*[User profile](U03-user-profile.md)* Rules 2f and 3):
     "…/index/user/profile/notificationSettings" opens "Notifications",
     while the address with no tab, or with a word that names none
     ("…/index/user/profile/password", for one), opens "Identity". The
     site-level tab is seen by a user with roles in
     several journals or in none, and by the Site Administrator of a site
     with several journals (a site with one journal was not tried). No
     event listed on the tab is raised at site level, so the site-level set
     currently governs nothing ⚠ [A4](#a4).
   - 5e. **Registration presets the email choice.** A person who registers
     with the box "Yes, I would like to be notified of new publications and
     announcements." unticked (*[Registration & account validation](U02-registration-and-account-validation.md)*)
     starts with "Do not send me an email…" ticked on every row of the
     "Public Announcements" group of that journal, and "Enable…" ticked as
     for everyone. Registering with the box ticked leaves every box at its
     default. <sup>h</sup>
6. **The roster: what each row governs.** Every row on the tab is one event
   type. The feature named in the second column raises it and says exactly
   when; this table says who is told, how, and whether an email carries
   the Unsubscribe link (Rule 7). "No task" means the event shows nothing
   in the application (no row in the Tasks panel, no screen announcing
   it), so the "Enable…" box only matters for the email. Three rows ("An
   issue has been made open access.", "Weekly email of outstanding tasks"
   and "Statistics report summary.") are raised by a *scheduled task*: a
   job the site runs on its own timer, which no screen and no action of a
   person starts (unlike scenario 9's issue email, which "Publish Issue"
   queues; "When emails arrive", Canonical scenarios). On the test
   installs that timer does not run, so no scenario produces the
   open-access email or the reminder email. The test tooling can start
   the monthly statistics run for a single journal
   ([Editorial statistics](U65-editorial-statistics.md#monthly-email)
   scenario 3 does), and its email and task are the last row below.
   <sup>e</sup>

   | Row (as on the tab) | Raised by (owner) | Who is told | In the application | Email (footer link?) |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | "A new announcement has been created." / "New announcement." | A Journal Manager posts an announcement (*[Announcements](U12-announcements.md)*) | every user with a role in the journal | no task | only when the announcement was posted with "Send an email about this to all registered users." ticked; link: yes |
   | "An issue has been published." {OJS} | A Journal Manager publishes an issue with "Send an email about this to all registered users." ticked in the "Publish Issue" dialog (*[Issues](U50-issues.md#publish-issue)*) | every user with a role in the journal | no task | yes; link: yes |
   | "An issue has been made open access." {OJS} | the day an issue of a subscription journal becomes open access, if the journal's open-access notification is on (those screens are *[Subscriptions & open access control](U51-subscriptions.md)*'s). A scheduled task raises it (above); no screen starts it | every user with a role in the journal | no task | yes; link: yes |
   | "A new article, "Title," has been submitted." | a new submission into a section whose form has an editor ticked under "Editorial Assignments" (Settings › Journal › "Sections", a section's "Edit"; the assignment itself is *[Submission wizard](U21-submission-wizard.md)*'s). On every journal but the install's first (its oldest; the seeded journal, on a test install) the tick is ignored and this event never happens: the submission raises the "needs an editor" row's event instead, as if nobody were ticked ⚠ [A11](#a11) <sup>e</sup> | nobody, by this row, on any journal but the install's first: the ticked editor gets neither task nor email, and the "needs an editor" row's task and email go to that row's recipients exactly as for that row below (what the ticked editor gets on the install's first journal was never seen, [A11](#a11)) | none of this row's own. That task is the "needs an editor" row's and answers to that row's "Enable…" box, not this one's (Rule 5a, scenario 3); what this row's own boxes change was never seen, the event never having happened on a test install | none of this row's own; link: no. That email is the "needs an editor" row's, stopped only by that row's "Do not send me an email…" box ⚠ [A10](#a10) (scenario 4); nothing to the ticked editor |
   | "A new version of your submission, "Title", was published." | a version goes live (*[Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)*) | every user holding an Author assignment on the submission | a task, the title inside its sentence and no title line under it (Rule 2b) | the "Publication Published" email; link: no ⚠ [A8](#a8) |
   | "A new article has been submitted to which an editor needs to be assigned." | a new submission with nobody assigned automatically (*[Submission wizard](U21-submission-wizard.md)*) | every user holding a manager-level role in the journal (*Actors & permissions*), the Site Administrator included wherever enrolled in one; a Section Editor, a Copyeditor (on a preprint server an Editorial Board Member), an Author and a Reader get neither task nor email <sup>e</sup> | a task, until a Section Editor is assigned to the submission (Rule 1); the assigned Section Editor gets none | the "needs an editor" email, subject "A new submission needs an editor to be assigned: "{title}""; link: no ⚠ [A8](#a8); sent even with "Enable…" unticked ⚠ [A10](#a10) |
   | "Discussion added." | a discussion is opened with the person as a participant, and every reply to it (*[Tasks & discussions](U37-tasks-and-discussions.md)*) | the discussion's participants, the person who wrote the message included | a task reading "{who opened it} started a discussion: {name}: {opening message}", where an opening message of 198 characters or fewer shows whole and a longer one shows its first 199 characters followed by "..." (so one of exactly 199 shows whole, with "..." after it); for a reply the same sentence again ⚠ [A1](#a1) <sup>e</sup> | the whole message, however long, subject the discussion's name, its From line naming the person who wrote it; link: yes, in Rule 7a's "Reply to this comment…" sentence |
   | "Discussion activity." | nothing: no event raises it ⚠ [A1](#a1) | — | — | — |
   | "A reviewer has commented on "Title"." | a reviewer submits a review (*[Reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md)*) | only the editors assigned to the submission on its Participants panel, an Editor or a Section Editor; that panel's "Assign" offers no Journal Manager role, so a Journal Manager not assigned in an editor role gets nothing <sup>e</sup> | no task | the review-complete email, subject "Review complete: {reviewer} recommends {recommendation} for #{submission number} {authors} — "{title}"" ({submission number} and {authors} as in Rule 7a; {OMP} "recommends None", the press's review form offering no recommendation, a wording *[Reviewer's review](U28-reviewers-review.md#omp2)* records); link: yes, in Rule 7a's "This is an automated message…" sentence |
   | "Weekly email of outstanding tasks" | the monthly reminder of outstanding tasks that *[Submissions dashboard (editorial)](U23-submissions-dashboard.md)* describes (the "Weekly" mislabel is noted in Fields); listed on a preprint server too, where the email is never sent ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1). A scheduled task raises it (above); no screen starts it | Journal Managers and Section Editors with submissions waiting on them (which submissions count is *[Submissions dashboard (editorial)](U23-submissions-dashboard.md)*'s to say) | no task | yes; link: yes, in Rule 7a's "This is an automated message…" sentence |
   | "Statistics report summary." | the monthly statistics email that *[Editorial statistics](U65-editorial-statistics.md#monthly-email)* describes, sent while the journal's "Editorial statistics" choice is "Send a monthly email to editors." (Settings that modify behavior). A scheduled task raises it (above); no screen starts it | every user holding a manager-level role in the journal (*Actors & permissions*), the Site Administrator included wherever enrolled in one, every Section Editor and {OJS} every Guest Editor; an Author and a Reader get neither task nor email, and neither do {OJS OMP} a Reviewer, a Copyeditor or a Funding Coordinator, {OMP} a Volume Editor and {OPS} an Editorial Board Member <sup>e</sup> | a task reading "This is a kind reminder for you to check your publication's health through the editorial report.", with no title line under it (Rule 2b); pressing it opens Statistics › "Editorial Activity" (Rule 2c) | the statistics email, subject "Editorial activity for {month}, {year}" ("Preprint Server activity for {month}, {year}" on a preprint server), with the spreadsheet "editorial-report.csv" attached; link: yes |

   Two emails are governed by no box on this tab:
   - the reviewer's "Review assignment updated." notice; *[Reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#a12)*
     records that gap;
   - {OPS} "New Version Posted Acknowledgement", which reaches the author
     when a preprint is posted even with "Do not send me an email…"
     ticked under "A new version of your submission, "Title", was
     published."; the "Preprint Posted" choice under Settings › Workflow ›
     "Emails" governs it
     (*[Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)*).
     <sup>e</sup>
7. **Notification emails and their footer.** <sup>f</sup>
   - 7a. An email marked "link: yes" in Rule 6 ends with a footer: a dash
     ("—") on a line of its own, then one of the three sentences below. In
     each, "Unsubscribe" or "unsubscribe" is the link, and the journal
     name links to the journal. The emails are sent as HTML only; a mail
     program that shows an email as text (the mail catcher's "Text" tab,
     for one) prints each link's address in parentheses after the link's
     words. The sentences:
     - "Unsubscribe from emails sent by {journal name}." on the
       announcement, issue and statistics emails; <sup>e</sup>
     - "This is an automated message from {journal name}. You can unsubscribe from this email at any time." on the review-complete email and on the reminder of outstanding tasks (a scheduled task sends the reminder; no screen does);
     - "Reply to this comment at #{submission number} {authors} or
       unsubscribe from emails sent by {journal name}." on the discussion
       emails. {submission number} is the number the submission's
       workflow page shows at its top; {authors} is the first author's
       family name, followed by "et al." when the submission has more
       than one author. The "#{submission number} {authors}" part links
       to the submission's workflow: a Journal Manager who presses it
       lands there, while the submission's Author, signed in, lands on the
       page "The current role does not have access to this operation."
       instead ⚠ [A16](#a16). To a person asked to review the submission
       under "Anonymous Reviewer/Anonymous Author" (in any round, even a
       request since cancelled), the authors are left out, and the
       link reads "#{submission number}" alone; every other addressee of
       the same discussion, and a reviewer under "Anonymous
       Reviewer/Disclosed Author" or "Open", still reads the authors.
   - 7b. The link is personal and permanent: it names the addressee and the
     notification it came with, needs no sign-in, and keeps working every
     time it is opened. It stops working only if the notification it came
     with is deleted, as a task can be from the Tasks panel ⚠ [A7](#a7).
   - 7c. The same emails also carry the hidden headers that let a mail
     program show its own "Unsubscribe" button. Whether that button works is
     an open question ⚠ [A5](#a5); the link in the footer is the supported
     way.
   - 7d. Both the link and the headers depend on a secret the system administrator sets in the configuration file, which no screen shows (Settings). Without it, the footer link opens the "404 Not Found" page ⚠ [A6](#a6).
8. **The Unsubscribe page.** <sup>f</sup>
   - 8a. **Reaching it.** The footer link opens the page in the journal's
     reader-facing layout, signed in or not. The link's address ends
     "…/notification/unsubscribe?validate={code}&id={notification number}":
     a long code, and the number the application gave the notification the
     email came with (not the submission's number); no screen shows either,
     and nothing below needs them matched. Three broken links open the bare
     "404 Not Found" page instead (that text alone, without the journal's
     header): "…?id={notification number}" (the code and its name cut
     out); "…?validate={code}" (everything from the "&" on deleted); and
     the intact address with a number no notification has in place of
     {notification number} (999999999, for one). The same bare page is
     what an intact link opens once the addressee has deleted, from their
     own Tasks panel, the task that came with that email (Rule 7b; another
     participant deleting their own row changes nothing). The discussion
     emails (Rule 6) are the ones to try that on: their link comes with
     the task itself.
   - 8b. **What it shows.** The heading, sentence, boxes, "user profile"
     link and "Unsubscribe" button described in Fields. The sentence names
     the addressee's email address and the journal, whoever is signed in.
   - 8c. **What "Unsubscribe" saves.** The page replaces the addressee's
     email choices for that journal with its boxes: every ticked box becomes
     "Do not send me an email…" ticked on the tab, and every unticked box
     becomes unticked there, even if the person had ticked it on the tab
     before ⚠ [A2](#a2). The "Enable…" boxes are never touched: tasks and
     notices continue.
   - 8d. **The result page.** After "Unsubscribe" the page reads "You have
     been unsubscribed" with "The email address {email} has been
     successfully unsubscribed. We'll no longer send you those emails. You
     can resubscribe to email notifications at any time from your user
     profile." The page can go stale: if it is left open while the person
     signs out in another tab of the same browser (or clears the browser's
     cookies) and "Unsubscribe" is then pressed on the old page, it
     reads "We could not unsubscribe you" with "There was an unexpected
     error and we could not unsubscribe the email address {email}. You can
     unsubscribe from all email notifications in your user profile or
     contact us directly for help." Opening the emailed link afresh works
     again. A sign-in alone in another tab leaves the open page working.
   - 8e. **The "user profile" link** on both pages opens the journal's
     Profile page on its first tab, "Identity", not on "Notifications"; a
     signed-out visitor is asked to sign in first and then lands there.
9. **Toasts.** A toast is the application's generic short message: a white
   box with a coloured left edge at the top right of the editorial page.
   When several arrive they stack, each new one under the last. <sup>g</sup>
   - 9a. **Three looks.** A success message has a green edge (after a
     save: "Your changes have been saved." unless the screen has a more
     specific sentence). A plain notice has a blue edge (for one, "The
     plugin "Custom Block Manager" has been enabled." after ticking that
     plugin under Settings › Website › "Plugins"). A warning, for a
     refused action or a server error, has a pink edge: for one, "Please
     ensure that you have filled out the message field and included
     someone other than yourself in the discussion." after "Notify" is
     pressed with "Message" empty in the "Notify" side panel (on a
     submission's Participants panel, a person's "More Actions" ›
     "Notify"; *[Stage participants](U35-stage-participants.md#notify)*).
   - 9b. **Closing.** Every toast has a "×" close control (named "Close"
     for screen readers). With no window open over the page, a press on
     the "×" removes the toast, and a toast left alone disappears by
     itself after a few seconds, staying while the pointer rests on it.
     The same holds over an open window (the "Notify" side panel showing
     9a's warning, or the "Add a Component" window of
     *[Submission intake configuration](U58-submission-intake-configuration.md)*
     after "Save" with -survey typed in "Key", whose warning reads "The
     key can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and
     hyphens, and must begin and end with an alphanumeric character."):
     the "×" removes the toast and the pointer resting on it keeps it, and
     the window stays open.
   - 9c. **Messages that are not toasts.** A form the server rejected
     shows no toast: its errors appear inside the form under the heading
     "Errors occurred processing this form" (the Profile page's
     "Password" tab with a wrong current password, for one), and that
     notice also removes itself, after about seven seconds. Some screens
     show the success message inside the form instead of as a toast
     (*[User profile](U03-user-profile.md)*'s Identity tab, for one); that
     is the screen's choice, described by its spec.

## Side effects

- **Marking, deleting** (Rule 3) changes the bell's badge, read after
  "Close": it counts unread rows only (up for "Mark New", down for "Mark
  Read" and for deleting an unread row; deleting a read row leaves it). The
  reader-side count follows on the next reader-facing page opened (Rule 4).
  There is nothing to save or confirm.
- **Deleting a task** also ends the Unsubscribe link of the email that
  announced it (Rule 7b) ⚠ [A7](#a7).
- **Saving the Notifications tab** (Rule 5) changes only future events;
  existing tasks stay, and no email is sent or recalled.
- **Unsubscribing** (Rule 8) rewrites the addressee's email choices for that
  journal; the tab shows the result the next time it is opened. No email
  confirms it.
- **Emails**: every email in Rule 6 is that feature's; this spec adds only
  the footer and the choice that suppresses it. <sup>e</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

- **Editorial statistics email (per journal).** Settings › Workflow ›
  "Emails", group "For Editors", field "Editorial statistics": "Send a
  monthly email to editors." (the default on the test installs and on
  every new journal) lists the "Statistics report summary." row on the tab
  and sends the monthly email; "Do not send the email to editors." removes
  the row from the tab (the Unsubscribe page keeps its box ⚠ [A9](#a9))
  and stops the email; choosing the first again brings the row back on
  the tab's next load. <sup>i</sup>
- **The API secret (configuration file, no screen).** A key the system administrator writes into the configuration file; no screen shows or sets it. Set on the test installs; without it the Unsubscribe links and headers are dead (Rule 7d) ⚠ [A6](#a6). <sup>i</sup>
- **Rows per page (configuration file, no screen).** The Tasks panel's page
  size, 25 on a default install; the panel's own "Items per page:" choice
  changes it for the moment only (Rule 2b). <sup>i</sup>
- **The journal's "Forms" languages.** Settings › Website › "Setup" ›
  "Languages", the "Forms" column
  (*[Languages and locales](U57-languages-and-locales.md#form-languages)*);
  a new journal has its primary language alone there. With English alone
  the signed-in name carries the unread count (Rule 4a); with French
  ticked as well it carries none (Rule 4c) [A15](#a15). <sup>c</sup>
- **The announcement's and the issue's email box** ("Send an email about
  this to all registered users.", Rule 6) **and the open-access
  notification** decide whether those events send email; they belong to
  *[Announcements](U12-announcements.md)*, *[Issues](U50-issues.md)* and
  *[Subscriptions & open access control](U51-subscriptions.md)*. The
  journal's "Enable announcements" switch does not. While it is off the
  side menu no longer offers the Announcements page, but the page still
  opens at its address ("…/management/settings/announcements"), and an
  announcement added there still emails every user with a role in the journal, and its "Visit
  our website to read the full announcement" link opens "404 Not Found"
  ([Announcements A8](U12-announcements.md#a8)). <sup>e</sup>

## Cross-feature interactions

- **User profile** owns the Notifications tab as a screen: the tabs, the
  "Save" button and message, the pairing of the two boxes as a form
  behaviour, and the site-level profile. This spec owns what the boxes mean
  (Rule 5) and the row list (Fields).
- **Registration & account validation** owns the "Yes, I would like to be
  notified…" box; its effect on the tab is Rule 5e.
- **Navigation menus & site chrome** owns the editorial header and the
  reader-side header the bell and the count sit in; the bell's window and
  the count's value are this spec's (Rules 2 and 4).
- **Submission wizard**, **Publish, schedule & versions**, **Reviewer
  assignment & management**, **Submissions dashboard**,
  **[Announcements](U12-announcements.md)**, **[Issues](U50-issues.md)**,
  **[Subscriptions & open access control](U51-subscriptions.md)**,
  **[Stage participants](U35-stage-participants.md)** and
  **[Tasks & discussions](U37-tasks-and-discussions.md)** each raise the events in Rule 6 and own their
  triggers, recipients and email texts; the discussion form ("Add" in the
  workflow page's discussions panel) and its reply are *Tasks &
  discussions*'.
  **Review stage & rounds** owns the
  decision tasks that an editorial decision raises and that also land in
  the Tasks panel (for one, "Revision required." on a journal and
  "Revisions to consider in External Review." on a press); they have no
  row on the tab and cannot be switched off.
- **Emails management** owns the templates the notification emails are built
  from; the footer is added after the template and is not editable there.

## Canonical scenarios

Scenarios 1–6 and 8–11 run on a scratch journal with throwaway accounts,
because they change notification choices and raise tasks that would
linger; scenario 7, which only looks, uses a ready account on the seeded
journal, and its site-level step needs a second journal on the site. The
ready accounts and their passwords, the mail catcher's address and the
tooling recipe are in the footnote. <sup>s0</sup>

**The scratch journal.** Its accounts' Notifications tabs start at their
defaults, and the Site Administrator is a Journal Manager of it, so every
new submission's "needs an editor" task reaches them too (Rule 6). Its
only "Forms" language is English, as on the seeded journal, and every
page is read in a window 992 px or wider, so the unread count sits
beside the name (Rules 4a, 4c), except where a step narrows the window.

**When emails arrive.** Every email in scenarios 1–6 and 11 leaves at the
moment of the action and is in its mailbox within a second. Where a
scenario says a mailbox holds no email for a submission, a discussion or
a review, wait until the other person's email for the same one has
arrived, then look for an email about that title or that discussion's
name alone: the mailbox's earlier emails stay and do not count. Scenario
9's issue email is different: "Publish Issue" only queues it for the
site's background jobs, and on the test installs the jobs do not run by
themselves. After "Publish Issue", run the site's background jobs (the
footnote says how) and judge both mailboxes only once they have run.

1. **A submission raises a task, and the bell counts it**

   Given: an Author and a Journal Manager, throwaway accounts on a scratch
   journal; the Manager has no task yet and is not the Site Administrator
   (Rule 2d). <sup>s1</sup>

   - **The Author submits**: the Author submits a new submission (the
     wizard to its "Submit" dialog; on a preprint server its "For Readers"
     step's "Relation status" answered "This preprint has not been
     published elsewhere.").
   - **The bell**: the Journal Manager opens any editorial page after the
     submission (or reloads the one that is open): a red "1" on the bell;
     a page that was already open before the submission still shows no
     number (Rule 2a).
   - **The reader-side count**: on the journal's home page the Manager's
     name in the header reads "{name} 1"; under the name are "Dashboard"
     and "View Profile" and no list of tasks: it is a count only (Rule 4).
   - **The narrow window**: narrow the browser window below 992 px and,
     on the journal's home page, press "Open Menu": the Manager's name is
     listed bare, with "Dashboard", "View Profile" and "Logout" under it,
     and the number follows "Dashboard": "Dashboard 1" (Rule 4b). Widen
     the window back to 992 px or more.
   - **The Tasks window**: back on an editorial page, press the bell: the
     "Tasks" window opens with one row, its sentence in bold, "A new
     article has been submitted to which an editor needs to be assigned."
     (worded per application as in Fields), with the submission's title
     under it; while the window is open the bell in the header is greyed
     out with no number.
   - **The margin of the row**: press 4 px inside the row's bottom
     right-hand corner: nothing happens; the window stays as it is
     (Rule 2c).
   - **Opening the task**: press the row's sentence: {OJS OMP} the
     submission's workflow opens over the submissions dashboard (Rule 2c);
     {OPS} a reader-facing page reading "A workflow stage was not
     specified." opens instead ⚠ [OPS3](#ops3).
   - **The blank space beside the sentence**: back on an editorial page,
     press the bell, then press the blank space to the right of the row's
     sentence, on the sentence's line: the same page opens as after the
     press on the sentence (Rule 2c).
   - **Control**: back on any editorial page the bell shows no number,
     opening the window again shows the row's sentence in regular type,
     and the journal's home page now reads "{name} 0" (Rule 4, *Side
     effects*).

2. **Mark New, Mark Read, Delete**

   Given: a Journal Manager, a fresh throwaway account on the scratch
   journal with no task yet (not scenario 1's Manager), and the Author;
   the Author has submitted twice, the second submission at least a
   second after the first ([A12](#a12)), and the Manager has not opened
   the Tasks window in between, so the window holds exactly two rows,
   both unread, and the bell shows "2"; a second Journal Manager of the
   journal who has not opened their window either. <sup>s2</sup>

   - **Newest first**: open the window: the first row carries the later
     submission's title under its sentence, the second row the earlier
     submission's (Rule 2b).
   - **The "Select" column**: each row starts with a box, and the
     column's header holds none, so no box ticks every row at once
     (*Fields & validation*, "The Tasks panel").
   - **"Mark Read" with no box ticked**: press "Mark Read": both rows stay
     bold and no message appears (Rule 3).
   - **"Mark Read"**: tick the first row and press "Mark Read": the row's
     sentence turns to regular type and its box is unticked again. Press
     "Close": the bell shows "1".
   - **"Mark New"**: open the window again, tick the same row and press
     "Mark New": the row is bold again.
   - **The Escape key**: press Escape: the window closes, and the bell
     shows "2" (*Fields & validation*, "The Tasks panel").
   - **"Delete"**: open it again, tick both rows and press "Delete": both
     rows vanish at once with no question asked and the list reads "No
     Items"; press "Close": the bell shows no number. Reload the page:
     still no number, and the window is still empty.
   - **Control**: the second Journal Manager opens their own Tasks window:
     their two rows for the same submissions are still listed; what one
     Manager deletes leaves another's rows untouched (*Actors &
     permissions*).

3. **Unticking "Enable…" stops the task, not the email**

   Given: two Journal Managers, A and B, and an Author, throwaway accounts
   on the scratch journal; Manager A on Profile › "Notifications".
   <sup>s3</sup>

   - **Manager A unticks "Enable…"**: untick "Enable these types of
     notifications." under "A new article has been submitted to which an
     editor needs to be assigned." (its email box greys out) and press
     "Save": the toast "Your changes have been saved." appears at the top
     right (Rule 9). Manager B changes nothing.
   - **The toast**: press "Save" again at once: a second toast stacks
     under the first; press the first toast's "×": it goes; the other
     stays while the pointer rests on it and disappears by itself a few
     seconds after the pointer leaves (Rule 9).
   - **The Author submits**: the Author submits a new submission.
   - **Manager A's window**: gains no row for this submission, and the
     number on the bell does not grow (the rows from earlier submissions
     stay) (Rule 5a).
   - **Manager B's window**: gains the row.
   - **Both mailboxes**: each holds an email whose subject is "A new
     submission needs an editor to be assigned: "{title}"": Manager A's
     arrives all the same ⚠ [A10](#a10).
   - **Manager A re-ticks the box**: the email box is offered again,
     unticked; press "Save": the window still holds no row for that
     submission; nothing was stored while the box was unticked (Rule 5a).
   - **Control**: the Author submits again: Manager A's window gains the
     row for this second submission; re-ticking brings back future events
     only (Rule 5a).

4. **Ticking "Do not send me an email…" keeps the task, stops the email**

   Given: two Journal Managers, A and B, a Section Editor and an Author,
   throwaway accounts on the scratch journal; Manager A on Profile ›
   "Notifications". <sup>s4</sup>

   - **Manager A ticks the email box**: tick "Do not send me an email for
     these types of notifications." under "A new article has been
     submitted to which an editor needs to be assigned." and press "Save".
     Manager B changes nothing.
   - **The Author submits**: the Author submits a new submission.
   - **Both Tasks windows**: both managers get the task in their Tasks
     window (Rule 5b).
   - **Manager A's mailbox**: once Manager B's email for this submission
     has arrived (Control), holds no email with its subject ("When emails
     arrive").
   - **Manager B assigns the Section Editor**: Manager B opens the
     submission's workflow from the Dashboard and assigns the Section
     Editor to it with "Assign" on its Participants panel (the window is
     *[Stage participants](U35-stage-participants.md)*'): neither
     Manager's Tasks window holds the row for this submission's title any
     more, and the Section Editor's Tasks window holds no row for it
     either (Rules 1, 6).
   - **Manager A unticks "Enable…"**: back on Profile › "Notifications",
     untick "Enable these types of notifications." under the same row:
     its "Do not send me an email…" box greys out and keeps its tick;
     press "Save" (Rule 5c).
   - **The tab's next load**: open Profile › "Notifications" again: under
     that row "Enable…" is unticked and the email box is greyed out and
     unticked (Rule 5c).
   - **Manager A ticks "Enable…" back**: tick it: the email box is offered
     again, unticked; press "Save" (Rule 5c).
   - **The Author submits again**: the Author submits a second new
     submission: Manager A's mailbox holds the email whose subject is "A
     new submission needs an editor to be assigned: "{title}"" with the
     second submission's title; the event's emails come again (Rule 5c).
   - **Control**: Manager B's mailbox holds the email whose subject is "A
     new submission needs an editor to be assigned: "{title}"" with the
     first submission's title: the box stopped Manager A's email alone.

5. **Unsubscribing from an email's footer link**

   Given: a Journal Manager and an Author, throwaway accounts on the
   scratch journal, a submission of the Author's there, and a signed-out
   visitor's browser; the Manager on that submission's workflow page, on
   its Submission stage. <sup>s5</sup>

   - **The Manager opens a discussion**: in the panel headed "Desk Review
     Tasks & Discussions" (on a preprint server "Production Tasks &
     Discussions"), press "Add", type "Footer check" into "Name", tick the
     Author's box under "Participants" (the Manager's own box arrives
     ticked; the form offers no email choice), type "Please read the
     footer." under "Discussion" and press "Save".
   - **The Author's mailbox**: holds an email whose subject is the
     discussion's name, the Manager's name in its From line, ending "Reply
     to this comment at #{submission number} {authors} or unsubscribe from
     emails sent by {journal name}." (Rule 7a; {authors} is the Author's
     family name, the one author), with "unsubscribe" as the link and
     {journal name} a link to the journal; shown as text (the mail
     catcher's "Text" tab), each link's address follows the link's words
     in parentheses. The Manager's own mailbox holds a copy.
   - **The Unsubscribe page, signed out**: open the "unsubscribe" link in
     the signed-out browser: the "Unsubscribe" page shows "Select the
     emails that you no longer wish to receive at {the Author's address}
     from {journal name}.", every box ticked, and the button
     "Unsubscribe". Press it: "You have been unsubscribed" with the
     sentence naming the Author's address (Rule 8d). Open the link again:
     the page shows again, boxes ticked (Rule 7b).
   - **No email confirms it**: the Author's mailbox still holds the
     discussion's email alone (*Side effects*).
   - **Three broken links**: open the link with everything from its "&"
     on deleted; with the code and its name cut out, so the address ends
     "…?id={notification number}"; and intact but with 999999999 in place
     of the notification number: each opens the bare "404 Not Found"
     page, that text alone, without the journal's header (Rule 8a).
   - **"user profile", signed out**: open the intact link once more and
     press "user profile": the Login page; sign in as the Author: the
     journal's Profile page opens on "Identity" (Rule 8e).
   - **The Author's tab**: press "Notifications": under every row of the
     tab, "Do not send me an email for these types of notifications." is
     ticked, and "Enable these types of notifications." is still ticked
     (Rule 8c); the tab has no row that the Unsubscribe page did not list
     a box for.
   - **The Manager opens a second discussion**: as before ("Add", "Second
     check" into "Name", the Author's box ticked, "Still reading?" under
     "Discussion", "Save"): the Manager's own mailbox holds the email
     whose subject is that new name.
   - **A toast over the "Notify" panel**: on the same workflow page's
     Participants panel, press the Author's "More Actions" › "Notify",
     leave "Message" empty and press "Notify": a pink-edged toast at the
     top right reads "Please ensure that you have filled out the message
     field and included someone other than yourself in the discussion."
     (Rule 9a); it stays while the pointer rests on it and disappears by
     itself a few seconds after the pointer leaves, while the "Notify"
     side panel stays open (Rule 9b).
   - **Control**: once the Manager's copy of the second discussion's email
     has arrived, the Author's mailbox holds no email with the subject
     "Second check" (the first discussion's email is still there),
     while the Author's Tasks window holds a new row reading "{the
     Manager's name} started a discussion: {the new name}: {the message}":
     the email stopped, the task kept (Rule 8c).

6. **The link acts on the addressee, not on whoever is signed in**

   Given: a Journal Manager and an Author, throwaway accounts on the
   scratch journal (not scenario 5's), a submission of the Author's there
   that lists a second author after the Author, and in the Author's
   mailbox the email of a discussion the Manager opened on it as in
   scenario 5's first step; the Manager signed in. <sup>s6</sup>

   - **The footer with two authors**: the Author's email ends "Reply to
     this comment at #{submission number} {authors} or unsubscribe from
     emails sent by {journal name}.", where {authors} reads the Author's
     family name followed by "et al." (Rule 7a).
   - **The page, signed in as the Manager**: open the email's
     "unsubscribe" link: the page names the Author's address, not the
     Manager's (Rule 8b).
   - **The stale page**: leave it open; in another tab of the same browser
     sign out; back on the old page press "Unsubscribe": "We could not
     unsubscribe you" with "There was an unexpected error and we could not
     unsubscribe the email address {the Author's address}. You can
     unsubscribe from all email notifications in your user profile or
     contact us directly for help." (Rule 8d).
   - **The link afresh**: still signed out, open the emailed link afresh:
     the page shows again with the Author's address (Rule 8d).
   - **A sign-in in another tab**: leave the page open; in another tab of
     the same browser sign in as the Manager again; back on the page,
     untick every box but "Discussion added." and press "Unsubscribe": the
     success page shows; a sign-in alone leaves the open page working
     (Rule 8d).
   - **"user profile", signed in**: press "user profile": the journal's
     Profile page opens on "Identity" (Rule 8e).
   - **The Author's tab**: now has "Do not send me an email…" ticked on
     "Discussion added." only.
   - **Control**: the Manager's own tab is unchanged.

7. **The rows, per application, and the site-level tab**

   Given: a Journal Manager, a ready account on the seeded journal, on
   Profile › "Notifications"; the Site Administrator, with unread tasks,
   on a site that holds more than one journal (Rule 5d). <sup>s7</sup>

   - **The rows**: the tab lists the four groups with exactly the rows in
     Fields for this application, "Editors" holding "Weekly email of
     outstanding tasks" and "Statistics report summary.", every "Enable…"
     box ticked and every email box unticked.
   - **The site's home page as a Manager**: open the site's own home page:
     the Manager's name in the header is bare, with no number (Rule 4).
   - **The site-level tab**: as the Site Administrator, open the site-level
     profile at "…/index/user/profile" (Rule 5d) and its "Notifications"
     tab: the same groups, without "Statistics report summary.".
   - **The site-level bell**: press the bell on that page: the same "Tasks"
     window, with the same rows as from a journal's editorial page
     (Rule 2d).
   - **Control**: on the site's own home page the Site Administrator's
     name is bare too, and at a desktop-width window the "Dashboard"
     entry in the list under it reads "Dashboard" alone; the number the
     bell shows is written after "Dashboard" in the page's source, where
     the browser's page inspector finds it, but not displayed
     [A13](#a13) (Rule 4); with the window narrowed below 992 px and
     "Open Menu" pressed, the same entry displays it, "Dashboard {n}" with
     {n} the number the bell shows (Rules 4b, 4d).

8. **Registration presets the email choice**

   Given: two visitors, signed out, on a scratch journal's "Register"
   page. <sup>s8</sup>

   - **Registering with the box unticked**: the first visitor registers
     with "Yes, I would like to be notified of new publications and
     announcements." unticked, then signs in and opens Profile ›
     "Notifications": under every row of "Public Announcements", "Enable…"
     is ticked and "Do not send me an email…" is ticked (Rule 5e).
   - **The reader-side header**: on the journal's home page the new
     account's name shows without a number: a Reader sees the bare name
     (Rule 4).
   - **Control**: the second visitor registers with the box ticked: both
     boxes are at their defaults on every row.

**Application-specific**

9. **An issue's email and its Unsubscribe link** {OJS}

   Given: a Journal Manager, a Reader and an Author, throwaway accounts
   on a scratch journal set up fresh for this scenario, not the one
   scenarios 1–6 used, so the Author's Notifications tab is untouched by
   scenario 5; the journal holds one unpublished issue, listed under
   Issues › Future Issues as "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026): {title}". <sup>s9</sup>

   - **The Reader unticks "Enable…"**: the Reader opens Profile ›
     "Notifications", unticks "Enable…" under "An issue has been
     published." and saves; the Author never opens Profile ›
     "Notifications", so every box on the Author's tab is still at its
     default.
   - **The Manager publishes the issue**: the Manager opens Issues › Future
     Issues, presses the small arrow at the start of the issue's row to
     show its actions, presses "Publish Issue" and, in the dialog, leaves
     "Send an email about this to all registered users." ticked (it
     arrives ticked) and confirms "OK"
     (*[Issues](U50-issues.md#publish-issue)* owns that dialog; an issue with no articles publishes without a
     warning). Run the site's background jobs ("When emails arrive"
     above).
   - **The Author's mailbox**: holds the issue email: its subject is "Just
     published: Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026): {title} of {journal name}", and its
     footer (Rule 7a) reads "Unsubscribe from emails sent by {journal
     name}." with "Unsubscribe" as the link.
   - **Control**: the Reader's mailbox holds no email with that subject
     (Rule 5a).

   A press and a preprint server have no issues and no issue row on the
   tab (Fields); nothing runs there.

10. **A published version raises a task for the Author** {OJS OMP OPS}

    Given: an Author and a Journal Manager, throwaway accounts on the
    scratch journal; a submission of the Author's there whose version has
    just been published (the publishing steps are *[Publish, schedule &
    versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)*'); the Author has no
    task yet. <sup>s10</sup>

    - **The bell**: the Author opens any editorial page after the publish:
      a red "1" on the bell (Rule 2a).
    - **The Tasks window**: press the bell: one row, its sentence in bold,
      "A new version of your submission, "{title}", was published." with
      the submission's title inside it, and no title line under it
      (Rules 2b, 6).
    - **Control**: the Journal Manager's Tasks window holds no row opening
      "A new version of your submission" for this title, while it does
      hold the "needs an editor" row the same submission raised, with the
      title under it (Rule 2b): the task
      goes to every user holding an Author assignment on the submission
      (Rule 6).

11. **The review-complete email goes to the assigned editors alone** {OJS OMP}

    Given: a Journal Manager, a Section Editor, an Author and a Reviewer,
    throwaway accounts on the scratch journal; a submission of the
    Author's in review, with the Section Editor assigned to it, the
    Reviewer's request accepted, and the Journal Manager not assigned.
    <sup>s11</sup>

    - **The Reviewer submits the review**: the Reviewer opens the review
      from the reviewer dashboard and walks its steps to "Submit
      Review" (on a journal choosing "Accept Submission" under
      "Recommendation"; a press's form offers none), answering "OK" to
      "Are you sure you want to submit this review?" (the steps are
      *[Reviewer's review](U28-reviewers-review.md)*'s).
    - **The Section Editor's mailbox**: holds an email whose subject is
      "Review complete: {reviewer} recommends {recommendation} for
      #{submission number} {authors} — "{title}"" ({OMP} "recommends
      None", a wording *[Reviewer's review](U28-reviewers-review.md#omp2)*
      records), ending "This is an automated message from {journal name}.
      You can unsubscribe from this email at any time." with "unsubscribe"
      as the link (Rules 6, 7a).
    - **No task**: the Section Editor's Tasks window holds no row for
      this submission: the review raised none for them, and neither did
      the submission itself, whose "needs an editor" task went to the
      manager-level roles alone (Rule 6).
    - **Control**: once the Section Editor's email has arrived, the Journal
      Manager's mailbox holds no email with that subject: a Journal
      Manager who is not assigned gets nothing (Rule 6).

    A preprint server has no reviewer role and no review stage, so
    nothing raises this email there; its tab lists the row all the same
    [OPS1](#ops1).

## Coverage

Left out of the scenarios above, by reason:

- **Planned**:
  - a Section Editor's task count in the menu under their name on the public pages (Rule 4; the guard [A3](#a3)'s issue report proposes, shared with Navigation menus & site chrome A2)
  - the "needs an editor" email staying away for a manager who unticked "Enable…" on its row (Rule 5a; scenario 3 reads the mailbox; the guard [A10](#a10)'s issue report proposes)
  - a preprint server's "needs a moderator" task opening the preprint's workflow (Rule 2c; scenario 1 presses a task; the guard [OPS3](#ops3)'s issue report proposes)
  - a reply in a discussion with "Discussion activity." switched off reaching neither the Tasks window nor the mailbox, and with it on a row reading "… replied to …" (Rule 6; the guard [A1](#a1)'s issue report proposes)
  - unticking a box on the "Unsubscribe" page leaving the emails switched off before still off (Rule 8c; the guard [A2](#a2)'s issue report proposes)
  - a preprint server's new-preprint row on the Notifications tab reading "A new preprint, "Title", has been submitted." (*Fields & validation*; the guard [OPS2](#ops2)'s issue report proposes)
  - {OMP} the review-complete email's subject reading "recommends None" (Rule 6; scenario 11 states it, the press's suite does not read it yet)
- **Rarely met**:
  - the Tasks window paged beyond 25 rows, "1 - 25 of 26 items" and "Items per page:" (Rule 2b): 26 tasks to raise for one account
  - the blue-edged notice toast (Rule 9a): the one screen that produces it is a plugin switch under Settings › Website › "Plugins", a Journal Manager's occasional act, not an editor's, author's or reviewer's week
- **Nothing new to test**:
  - a discussion task whose opening message is longer than 198 characters, shown as its first 199 characters and "..." (Rule 6): scenario 5's messages are short
  - a user with no role, or the Site Administrator, opening the Tasks panel (*Actors & permissions*): the same window scenario 1's Manager opens
  - the Editor and the Production Editor getting the "needs an editor" task and email (Rule 6): the same task and email as the Journal Manager's in scenarios 1, 3 and 4
  - toasts never subject to a choice (Rule 1): no box governs them, so there is nothing to switch
  - the bell's hidden name "Tasks N" (Rule 2a): the badge scenario 1 reads
  - the email choice on an event whose email is optional for the sender (Rule 5b): the same box as scenario 4's
  - an Editor, a Production Editor, a Funding Coordinator, a Translator or a Reviewer seeing the unread count beside the name (Actors row 3, Rule 4a): the same count scenario 1's Journal Manager reads
  - an assigned Editor getting the review-complete email (Rule 6): the same email as scenario 11's Section Editor
- **Register carries it**:
  - A3 (a Section Editor's or a Guest Editor's bare name on the reader-side header; Rule 4)
  - A11 (the ticked editor told nothing, the manager-level roles told instead; Rule 6)
  - A8 (the "Publication Published" and "needs an editor" emails without a footer; Rule 6)
  - OPS1 (two rows a preprint server never raises; Rule 6; scenario 11 names it)
  - A7 (deleting the task killing the link; Rule 7b)
  - A5 (a mail program's own "Unsubscribe" button; Rule 7c)
  - A4 (the site-level set governing nothing; Rule 5d)
  - A9 (the Unsubscribe page keeping the statistics box with the email off; *Settings*)
  - A12 (two tasks raised within one second listed in either order; Rule 2b; scenario 2's second submission comes a second after the first)
  - A13 (the Site Administrator's unread count hidden on the site's home page at a desktop width; Rule 4d; scenario 7 marks it)
  - A15 (no unread count beside the name on a journal with French under "Forms"; Rule 4c, *Settings*)
  - A16 (the discussion email's "#{submission number} {authors}" link refusing the submission's Author; Rule 7a)
- **No seed**:
  - the journal initials on the rows of an account with roles in several journals (Rules 2b, 2d)
  - each journal keeping its own set of choices (Rule 5d)
  - the open-access email and the reminder email of outstanding tasks (Rule 6): each raised by a scheduled task no screen starts
  - the API secret unset: every footer link opening "404 Not Found" (Rule 7d, *Settings*; A6): the configuration file is shared by every test
  - the Tasks panel's rows per page from the configuration file (*Settings*)
- **Owned by another feature**:
  - the site-level address forwarding a user with a role in one journal to that journal's profile (Rule 5d; *User profile*, scenario 2)
  - the warning toast for a refused action (Rule 9a; *[Stage participants](U35-stage-participants.md)*, scenario 6, after "Notify" with "Message" empty)
  - a toast's "×" over an open window removing the toast, the window left open (Rule 9b; *[Submission intake configuration](U58-submission-intake-configuration.md)*, scenario 6, the refused "Key")
  - a form the server rejected: errors inside the form, no toast, gone after about seven seconds (Rule 9c; *User profile*, scenario 8)
  - the success message shown inside the form instead of as a toast (Rule 9c; *User profile*, scenario 2)
  - the reviewer's "Review assignment updated." notice (Rule 6; *Reviewer assignment & management*)
  - the monthly statistics email and its task: who gets them, "Enable…" unticked stopping both, and the task opening "Editorial Activity" (Rules 2b, 2c, 5a, 6; *[Editorial statistics](U65-editorial-statistics.md)*, scenario 3)
  - the editorial statistics email off, its row leaving the tab and coming back when the email is on again (*Settings*; *[Editorial statistics](U65-editorial-statistics.md)*, scenario 4)
  - every email in Rule 6 as an email, its trigger, recipients and text (*Side effects*; the raising feature each row names)
  - the announcement's and the issue's email box and the open-access notification (*Settings*; *[Announcements](U12-announcements.md)*, *[Issues](U50-issues.md)*, *[Subscriptions & open access control](U51-subscriptions.md)*)
  - the announcements switch, which leaves an announcement's email going out (*Settings*; *[Announcements](U12-announcements.md#a8)*, its A8)
  - decision tasks landing in the panel with no box to switch them off (*Cross-feature interactions*; *Review stage & rounds*)
  - "Enable…" unticked under "A new announcement has been created." ("New announcement." on a press) stopping the announcement email (Rules 5a, 6; *[Announcements](U12-announcements.md)*, scenario 4)
  - an Author's "Do not send me an email…" under "A new version of your submission, "Title", was published." stopping the "Publication Published" email while the task still arrives (Rule 5b; *[Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)*, scenario 5)
  - {OPS} "New Version Posted Acknowledgement" still reaching an author who ticked that box (Rule 6, "Two emails are governed by no box"; *[Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)*, scenario 5, whose Author ticks that box before the post)

### All apps

<a id="a1"></a>
**A1 — A reply in a discussion ignores the "Discussion activity." choices and is announced as the discussion's start** · 🐞 · low.
The profile's Notifications tab offers a "Discussion activity." row
with two boxes, "Enable these types of notifications." and "Do not send
me an email for these types of notifications.". Neither does anything.
When someone adds a message to a discussion, every other participant
still gets a Tasks row and an email, whatever they chose on that row.
The Tasks row for the reply repeats the discussion's opening word for
word ("{who opened it} started a discussion: {name}: {opening
message}"), so it cannot be told from the opening without opening it.
The email does carry the reply.
On 3.5 a reply raises its own "… replied to …" row and obeys both
"Discussion activity." boxes. Both halves of the fault came with one
change (`pkp/pkp-lib#12323`), so one fix restores both. A press or a
preprint server cannot save a discussion at all today
(`pkp/pkp-lib#13072`), so it shows this only once that is fixed.
Basis: probe, 2026-10-04. <sup>[f-a1](#fn-a1)</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — Unticking boxes on an email's Unsubscribe page switches back on emails the person had turned off** · 🐞 · medium.
A person who had turned some emails off on Profile › "Notifications"
opens the "unsubscribe" link in another email. On the "Unsubscribe"
page a ticked box means "stop this email", and every box is ticked,
including the emails already off. To stop only this one email, they
untick the other boxes and press "Unsubscribe". That email does stop,
and the page reads "You have been unsubscribed". But every unticked box
is saved as "send me this email", so the emails they had turned off
are switched back on, without a word.
They find out when one of those emails arrives again, and can turn it
off again on the profile tab.
Many readers and authors have such emails off without ever opening the
tab: a new account that leaves "Yes, I would like to be notified of new
publications and announcements." unticked at registration starts with
the issue and announcement emails off.
Only sites that set an API secret in their configuration file (no screen shows or sets it) can reach the page. The installer leaves it empty, and then every unsubscribe link opens "404 Not Found".
Basis: probe, 2026-10-04. <sup>[f-a2](#fn-a2)</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — No reader-side count for a Section Editor or a Guest Editor** · 🐞 · low.
On the public pages of a journal whose only "Forms" language is English,
a user holding a role at the Journal Manager, Assistant, Reviewer or
Author permission level (the Journal Manager, the Editor, the Production
Editor, a Copyeditor, a Funding Coordinator, a Translator, a Reviewer, an
Author) sees their number of unread tasks beside their name in the
header, and in a narrow window after "Dashboard" in the "Open Menu" list
(Rule 4a); with French under "Forms" the number beside the name is gone
for every role ([A15](#a15)). A Section Editor (Series Editor on a press,
Moderator on a preprint server), or on a journal a Guest Editor, who
holds no role at those levels in the journal never sees the number in
either place, even while the bell shows "1", and learns of new tasks only
from the bell on the editorial pages. The same cause sends a Section
Editor's "Dashboard" to the Profile page
([Navigation menus & site chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md#a2)).
Read from the code's history, it worked in 3.0 and broke in 3.1.
Basis: probe, 2026-10-14; the Guest Editor, 2026-10-20. <sup>[f-a3](#fn-a3)</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — The site-level tab governs nothing** · ❓ · latent.
The Profile page reached without a journal in the address has the same
Notifications tab, minus the statistics row, and saves a separate set of
choices (Rule 5d). No event listed there is ever raised outside a journal:
a site announcement posted with "Send an email about this to all
registered users." ticked sends no email to anyone and lists no task. The
choices made there have no effect.
Question: should the site-level tab be hidden, or say that choices are per
journal? Lean: hide it; a tab that saves choices nothing reads misleads.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a4](#fn-a4)</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — A mail program's own "Unsubscribe" button probably fails** · ❓ · latent.
The notification emails carry the headers that make mail programs offer a
one-click "Unsubscribe" of their own (Rule 7c). That button sends a request
without the form token the Unsubscribe page insists on, so the answer would
be the "We could not unsubscribe you" page, unseen by the person who pressed
a button in their mail program.
Question: is the mail-program button meant to work? Lean: yes, the headers
are there for it, so the page should accept that request; a defect. Only a
mail program can settle it, so it stays a question.
Basis: judgment. <sup>[f-a5](#fn-a5)</sup>

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — Dead footer links without an API secret** · ❓ · user-visible.
The "API secret" is a key the site administrator types into the
application's configuration file; no screen shows or sets it, and the
configuration file a fresh install ships with leaves it empty. On an
install where it was never filled in, every notification email still ends
with the footer, but its "Unsubscribe" link opens the "404 Not Found"
page, and the hidden headers behind a mail program's own "Unsubscribe"
button point at the same dead link (Rule 7d): nobody on that install can
unsubscribe from any notification email. Because the shipped file leaves
the key empty, this is the state of every install whose administrator has
not edited that line, not a rare configuration; the test installs set the
key, which is why no scenario in this spec sees it.
Question: should the footer be left out when the link cannot work? Lean:
yes; a link that always fails is worse than none.
Basis: judgment (read from the code and the shipped configuration file;
not seen on a running install). <sup>[f-a6](#fn-a6)</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — Deleting a task kills its email's Unsubscribe link** · ❓ · latent.
Each Unsubscribe link is bound to the notification the email came with;
when that notification is a task, it is a row in the Tasks panel. A person
who deletes that row from the panel and later opens the email's link gets
"404 Not Found" instead of the Unsubscribe page, with no hint why. In
scope: the discussion emails (subject: the discussion's name), whose
link comes with the task itself. Exempt, because their events raise no
task and so nothing can be deleted: the announcement, issue and
open-access emails, the "A reviewer has commented" email and the
reminder of outstanding tasks. The statistics report raises a task too
(Rule 6), but its link comes with a record of its own, which nothing on
screen lists: after the Journal Manager deleted that task, the statistics
email's "Unsubscribe" still opened the page naming the Manager's
address. The "needs an editor" and "Publication Published"
emails carry no Unsubscribe link at all (A8).
Question: is the link meant to outlive the task? Lean: yes; the email is
still in the inbox, so its link should still work.
Basis: probe (a discussion email, its task deleted, the link opened
signed in and signed out; the statistics email, its task deleted,
2026-10-20). <sup>[f-a7](#fn-a7)</sup>

<a id="a8"></a>
**A8 — Two emails without the footer** · ❓ · minor.
Two notification emails carry no Unsubscribe footer and none of the hidden
headers that let a mail program offer its own "Unsubscribe" button, while
the announcement, issue and discussion emails carry both; the recipient
cannot unsubscribe from either email itself. The first is the "needs an
editor" email to the manager-level roles, ending "This is an automated email from
{journal name}."; a Manager can still stop it from the Profile page's
"Notifications" tab by ticking "Do not send me an email…" under its row,
the only box that works for it (A10), and that was seen live. The second
is the "Publication Published" email to an author (subject "Publication
Published", from the journal's own name and address), ending with the
address of the published item. The author's tab has a box for it too,
"Do not send me an email…" under "A new version of your submission,
"Title", was published.", and ticked it stops this email while the task
still arrives; that was seen.
Question: intended, or an omission? Lean: an omission; both are recurring
notification emails like the others.
Basis: probe (both emails' footers and headers; the Manager's box; the
author's box, 2026-10-20). <sup>[f-a8](#fn-a8)</sup>

<a id="a9"></a>
**A9 — The Unsubscribe page lists an email the journal never sends** · ❓ · minor.
On a journal whose editorial statistics email is switched off, the tab drops
the "Statistics report summary." row but the Unsubscribe page still offers
its box (Fields), so the page and the tab disagree about which emails exist.

**A10 — A manager who turns off the "needs an editor" notification still gets its email for every new submission** · 🐞 · low.
A journal manager unticks "Enable these types of notifications." under
"A new article has been submitted to which an editor needs to be
assigned." on the profile's "Notifications" tab and saves. The tab
promises that the event will then neither show up in the system nor be
emailed. The next submission that nobody is assigned to adds no task to
their "Tasks", as promised. But the "A new submission needs an editor to
be assigned" email still arrives.
The only box that stops this email is "Do not send me an email for these
types of notifications.", and it is greyed out while "Enable…" is
unticked. A manager who wants neither the task nor the email cannot have
that. The announcement
and issue emails do stop when "Enable…" is unticked.
The email goes to everyone with a manager-level role in the journal,
press or server. It is sent only for a submission that nobody is assigned
to: one in a section or series with no editors under "Editorial
Assignments", or a book submitted with no series.

**A11 — The ticked editor is told nothing; the Managers are told instead** · ❓ · user-visible.
A Journal Manager ticks a Section Editor under "Editorial Assignments" on
a section's form (Settings › Journal › "Sections", "Edit") so that every
new submission to that section goes to that editor. When an Author then
submits to the section, the ticked editor's Tasks panel gains no row and
their mailbox no email; instead every user holding a manager-level role
gets the "needs an editor" task and email (Rule 6, the row below this
one's), as if nobody were ticked. Seen on OJS and OPS, on a scratch journal; not tried on a
press, because a new press has no series and so no series form had an
editor to tick. On the install's first journal (its oldest; the seeded
journal on a test install) the assignment does happen, and there, read
from the application, the "needs an editor" task and email are replaced
by an email from the "Editor Assigned" template to the ticked editor, with no
task and no Unsubscribe link
(*[Stage participants](U35-stage-participants.md)* owns that email); its subject is not on this page, and neither that email
nor the editor's empty Tasks panel was ever seen. What would settle that
half: an editor assigned automatically on the install's first journal,
then their Tasks panel and mailbox read.
Question: is the ticked editor meant to be told on every journal? Lean:
yes. The assignment itself fails on every journal but the install's first,
a defect *[Submission wizard](U21-submission-wizard.md#a8)* records, and
this row's silence is that defect seen from the editor's side, not a
choice; a defect rather than intended.

**A12 — Two tasks raised in the same second come in either order** · ❓ · minor.
The Tasks window lists tasks newest first (Rule 2b), so a Journal Manager
whose window holds two "needs an editor" rows expects the later
submission's row first. When the two tasks were raised within the same
second, the rows came in either order. Seen on all three applications:
two Authors who press the wizard's final "Submit" at the same moment
raised their tasks within one second on three of six runs (twice on a
press, once on a preprint server), and the Manager's window then listed
the earlier submission first twice and the later once; rows seeded
within one second came in an order that held across reloads but was
neither oldest- nor newest-first. A person reading the window cannot
tell which of two same-second tasks is the newer.
Question: is newest-first meant to hold for tasks raised in the same
second? Lean: yes; breaking the tie by the task's number would keep the
newer row first.

**A13 — The Site Administrator's unread count is hidden on the site's home page** · ❓ · minor.
On a journal's home page a Journal Manager's name carries the number of
unread tasks (Rule 4a). On the site's own home page the Site
Administrator's name is bare, and in a window 992 px or wider the
"Dashboard" entry in the list under it, where the number is written,
reads "Dashboard" alone: the number is in the page's source and never
displayed. So at that width the Site Administrator has no visible unread
count anywhere on the site's home page, while a journal's home page shows
one beside the name. In a window narrower than 992 px, after "Open Menu",
the entry reads "Dashboard 2", the number displayed: only a narrow window
shows the Site Administrator the number there (Rule 4d).
The bare name may be the fault in [A15](#a15) rather than a choice: the
site's own languages on the test installs are French and English, and
read from the application, the Site Administrator's name is given the
number as a Journal Manager's is. One look settles it: the Site
Administrator's name on the site's home page of an install whose only
site language is English. If the number shows there, this entry folds
into A15.
Question: is the number under "Dashboard" meant to show at a desktop
width where the name carries none? Lean: yes, on the site's home page; a
number kept in the page but never displayed tells nobody anything, and the
name there could carry the count as it does on a journal's home page. On
the cause, the lean is A15's fault.

**A15 — On a journal, press or server with a "Forms" language other than the page's language, the signed-in name on the public pages loses its task count** · 🐞 · low.
On the public pages of a journal, press or preprint server, a signed-in
user's name in the header normally carries their number of unread tasks
("dbarnes 2"). The number goes missing whenever one of the "Forms"
languages differs from the language the page is read in. The "Forms"
languages are ticked in Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Languages", the
same place in all three apps. That covers every journal with two "Forms"
languages, whichever language the page is read in. It also covers a
journal whose only "Forms" language is English when a user reads its
pages in French. The users who lose the number are the ones who normally
have it: managers and editors, the assistant-level roles, Reviewers and
Authors. In a desktop-width window the public pages then show the number
nowhere. The "Tasks" button on the editorial pages still counts the
tasks.

Every discussion email ends "Reply to this comment at #{submission

submission's editorial workflow. A Journal Manager who presses it lands
on the workflow. The submission's own Author, signed in, lands instead on
the page "The current role does not have access to this operation.", so
in every discussion email to an author the link meant for replying leads
nowhere they can use; they have to find the submission on My Submissions
themselves. A preprint's first-post email has the same kind of link

**OPS1 — Rows for events a preprint server never raises** · ❓ · minor.
A preprint server's Notifications tab and Unsubscribe page list two rows,
seen live: "A reviewer has commented on "Title"." under "Reviewing Events"
and "Weekly email of outstanding tasks" under "Editors". A preprint server
has no reviewer role and no review stage, so nothing there can produce a
reviewer's comment. The second row is the reminder email listing an
editor's outstanding tasks: its label says "Weekly", but on a journal or a
press the email goes out monthly, a mislabel
*[Submissions dashboard (editorial)](U23-submissions-dashboard.md#a8)*
records; and on a preprint server the application never sends it at all,
because the job that sends it is not set to run there in the product
itself, not merely on the test server. So a Preprint Server Manager or
Moderator who ticks or unticks either row's boxes changes nothing, and the
reminder email never arrives. That the rows are listed was seen; that the
two events are never raised rests on reading the application, not on
watching it.
Question: hide the rows on a preprint server? Lean: yes.

**OPS2 — On a preprint server, the Notifications tab's new-preprint row has a stray space before the comma** · 🐞 · low.
On a preprint server, the first row under "Submission Events" on a
person's Profile › "Notifications" tab, and the same row on an email's
"Unsubscribe" page, reads "A new preprint , "Title", has been
submitted.", with a space before the first comma. The journal's and the
press's rows have none.
Only the English wording carries the space (and the Macedonian
translation, copied from it). The fix was made on 3.3 in 2022 and never
reached the later versions, so it is ready to port.

**OPS3 — On a preprint server, the manager's "a moderator needs to be assigned" task opens "A workflow stage was not specified." instead of the preprint** · 🐞 · medium.
A Preprint Server Manager presses the task "A new preprint has been
submitted to which a moderator needs to be assigned." in the header's
Tasks window, expecting the preprint's workflow to open, as it does for
the same task on a journal or a press. The browser lands instead on a
reader-facing page whose whole text is "A workflow stage was not
specified.", and the task is marked read on the way.
The task no longer counts as unread, though it stays listed until a
moderator is assigned. Each manager who gets the task is also sent the
"needs an editor" email for the same preprint, and its link opens the
workflow. A manager who turned that email off gets none, so for them the
task is the only link, and they have to find the preprint in the
submissions list.
Every manager gets the task for each new preprint that no moderator is
assigned to automatically. A new server's section names no moderator, so
on such a server that is every preprint.

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — The bell is `TopNavActions.vue` (`lib/ui-library`): a button whose
screen-reader text is `common.tasks` "Tasks", with a badge showing
`pkp.currentUser.unreadTasksCount` while non-zero and the modal is closed;
`openTasks()` opens a legacy modal titled "Tasks" loading
`grid.notifications.TaskNotificationsGridHandler` `fetchGrid`.
`TaskNotificationsGridHandler::loadData()` lists `Notification::withUserId()`
at `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_TASK` ordered by creation date descending, with no
context filter (Rule 2d); `NotificationsGridHandler::initialize()` adds the
column `common.tasks`, the empty-row text `grid.noItems` "No Items", the
below-grid actions `grid.action.markNew` "Mark New", `grid.action.markRead`
"Mark Read" and `grid.action.delete` "Delete", and the features
`SelectableItemsFeature` (row boxes) and `PagingFeature` (page size from
`[interface] items_per_page`, 25 by default). The row template
`controllers/grid/tasks/task.tpl` prints the message, the context acronym
(the Create Journal form's "Journal Initials" / "Press Initials" /
"Server Initials" field, `acronym`; not the OJS form's "Journal
Abbreviation") when `$isMultiContext` (the user has more than one
available context) and
the submission title when the notification has one
(`NotificationsGridCellProvider::_getTitle()`). The whole `task.tpl` block is the
title of a `LinkAction` (one `<a>` around message and details) posting to
`markRead` with `redirect=1`, which stamps `dateRead` and answers a
redirect to `NotificationManager::getNotificationUrl()` (Rule 2c). `markNew`,
`markRead` and `deleteNotifications` act on `selectedElements` that belong
to the session's user and answer `update:unread-tasks-count`, which the bell
listens to (Rule 3). No confirmation dialog: the JS handlers post directly
(`NotificationsGridHandler.js`). Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS
(Rules 2a–2d, 3; Actors rows 1–2; Fields "The Tasks panel"): the bell
(`button` with accessible name "Tasks" / "Tasks 1") is present for
`reader.rosa`, `author.alex`, `sectioneditor.ana`, `admin`, a scratch
Reader with no role in `publicknowledge`, and an account registered on the
site-level Register page with no journal ticked (the only path to a
no-role account: the scenario API refuses an empty roles list and a
journal-level registration always adds Reader); that last account lands on
the site index after sign-in and opens the site-level profile unforwarded,
with the same bell and "No Items". The open panel is a `[role=dialog]`
with a back-arrow "Close", heading "Tasks", table columns "Select" and
"Tasks", the three action links offered on an empty list, and the pager
"0 - 0 of 0 items"; while it is open the bell has the `disabled`
attribute and no badge. The badge is white on `rgb(208, 10, 108)`. Unread:
`div.task.unread > span.message` bold, read `div.task` regular; the
acronym `span.acronym` shows for a manager enrolled in two scratch
contexts and for `admin` ("T1MCE" between sentence and title). 26 seeded
submissions on OJS: 25 rows and the pager "Items per page: 10 25 50 75
100", "1 - 25 of 26 items 1 2 > >>". "Delete" on two ticked rows: no
browser dialog, no modal, "No Items" at once, no badge after a full
reload; a second Manager's two rows survived. Every action re-renders the
grid with the boxes cleared. The link target is the grid's own
`mark-read?redirect=1&selectedElements[]=<id>` (Rule 2c); pressing the
title or the sentence was tried; the blank space beside the text is
part of the link (note s1, 2026-10-20). The discussion row's link (OMP) lands the same way, on the
dashboard with the panel open; the redirect is the same address for every
submission task. `pkp.currentUser.unreadTasksCount` is set at page load and
updated only by the grid's own actions, so a task raised while a page is
open gives no badge until the next load (Rule 2a; six samples on each app
on 2026-09-04, none with a badge before a reload). `markRead`, `markNew`
and `deleteNotifications` write no event-log row (traced in the handlers;
not observed on a screen, so the body does not claim it). The
initials field reads "Journal Initials" and "Server Initials" since
pkp/ojs#5608 and pkp/ops#1315, seen 2026-10-01 at the PR heads
`b5504f9f74` (OJS) and `8c4a7b7597` (OPS), before their merge ("Journal
initials", "Server initials" until then).
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each (Fields "The
Tasks panel"; Rule 1): Escape with the window open closed it, and the
"Select" column's header holds no box (no tick-all). On a scratch
context with two Journal Managers, each window held the needs-editor row
(one read, one unread); after "Assign" of a Section editor (OMP Series
editor, OPS Moderator) on the submission's Participants panel ("OK",
`save-participant` 200) neither window held a row for the title and both
bells read "Tasks"; the assigned editor's window got no row either.
`AssignEditors`' task is deleted for every manager once an editor is
assigned.

`#navigationUserWrapper`: `manager.maya 0` and `author.alex 0` (a visible
`span.task_count`, plus a hidden one under "Dashboard"); `sectioneditor.ana`
and `reader.rosa` the bare name. A scratch Manager with one unread task:
"1" next to the name and the bell at "1". A scratch Section Editor made a
participant of a discussion: bell "Tasks 1", the discussion row in the
window, and the bare name on the home page (OJS, OMP, OPS). On the
site's own home page (`index/en`) `admin` shows the count on the
"Dashboard" entry ("Dashboard 46" on 2026-09-04), the name itself bare;
a Manager enrolled in two scratch contexts shows the bare name there and
no count anywhere (Rule 4). A Reviewer and a Copyeditor (OJS, OMP) and an
Editorial Board Member (OPS) show "{name} 0" on the journal's home page.
The test run of 2026-09-13 (scenario 7, OJS at 1280×900) read the entry's
text as "Dashboard 15" with the menu open, but its `span.task_count`
computed `display: none`: the default theme's `head.less` hides
`> li > ul a .task_count` inside its `@screen-desktop` (992 px,
`variables.less`) block and shows it only in the narrow block, where
`> li > a .task_count` (the count beside the name) is hidden instead. The
2026-09-04 "Dashboard 46" was the entry's text content, not what the
screen displayed (A13). OMP's copy of `head.less` is identical and OPS's
differs only in link colours (files compared 2026-09-13).
Live-probed 2026-10-13 on OJS, OMP and OPS `main`, two runs each, at

the settings map. `TASK` = `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_TASK` (listed in the Tasks
grid); `NORMAL` notifications are fetched only by screens that pass
`requestOptions` (Rule 1's notices). Toasts are `createTrivialNotification()`
(`NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_TRIVIAL`), never checked against the blocked lists.
Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS (Rule 6's task and email
columns; Rule 1 "recorded, not listed"): a context announcement posted
with its email box ticked reached every user with a role, the auto-enrolled
`admin` included, after `jobs.php run`, with the footer, and raised no task
(the window "No Items"); with "Enable…" unticked on the announcement row,
no email; the OJS "Publish Issue" dialog's box arrives ticked and the
issue email behaves the same (OMP and OPS have no issue rows). The
needs-editor task and email went to every manager of the scratch context
on a wizard submission (`SubmissionNeedsEditor`, from `admin@mail.test`,
subject as in Rule 6; body ending "This is an automated email from
{journal name}.", no footer, no `List-Unsubscribe` headers: A8); the
`EditorAssigned` path was not driven (its assignment fails off the first
journal, *Submission wizard* A8). Discussions: `POST
…/api/v1/submissions/{id}/tasks` raised a `TASK` row for each participant,
the opener included, and one email per participant, the opener included,
within 0.4 s; a reply (`…/tasks/{n}/notes`) raised a further row with the
opening's sentence and an email carrying the reply, with "Enable…" unticked
on "Discussion activity." making no difference (A1). An API-seeded
published submission raised the Author's "A new version of your
submission…" task on all three apps; a real publish through the workflow
on OMP ("Schedule For Publication", then Publication › "Publish", then
the window's "Publish") and OPS ("Post the preprint", "Post", "Post")
raised the same task and, within 0.4 s, the email `AuthorPublicationPublished`:
subject "Publication Published", From "{journal name}
<admin@mail.test>", body "Dear {name}, / Your publication, {title}, to
{journal name}, has been published. / To view your publication, please
visit {the item's public address}.", with no "—" line, no unsubscribe
wording and no `List-Unsubscribe` headers (A8; OJS not driven for this
half, same library mailable). The review-complete email was driven on OJS
and OMP: a reviewer who had accepted walked the review steps to "Submit
Review" and the "Confirm" window's "OK"; the assigned Section Editor's
mailbox 0.3 s later held `ReviewCompleteNotifyEditors`, subject "Review
complete: {reviewer} recommends {recommendation} for #{number} {authors}
— "{title}"" ("recommends None" on OMP, whose review form offers no
recommendation list), From "Site Admin <admin@mail.test>", Mailpit's
text rendering ending "—" then "This is an automated message from {journal name} (
{home} ). You can unsubscribe ( {link} ) from this email at any time.",
with the `List-Unsubscribe` headers; the journal's Manager, not assigned,
got no email; neither got a task. The `EditorAssigned` path (Rule 6's
"A new article, "Title," has been submitted." row) was not driven: the
assignment fails off the first journal (*Submission wizard* A8), and on a
scratch context a section with a Section Editor ticked under "Editorial
Assignments" still gave that editor no task and no email while every
Manager got the needs-editor pair; the row now states only that, and the
first-journal expectation (`NORMAL` level, so no task; `EditorAssigned`
without the `Unsubscribe` trait, so no link) is A11's, read from the
listener and mailable above (note f-a11). The open-access and
reminder emails were not driven: each comes from a scheduled task
(`OpenAccessNotification`, `EditorialReminder`) and the fleets run no
scheduler; nothing on a screen sends them, so the reminder's footer
sentence in Rule 7a comes from its mailable's locale key (`.automated`).
Live-probed 2026-09-29 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each (Rule 6's
statistics row; Rules 2b, 2c, 5a, 7a): the `StatisticsReport` task
started for one scratch context through the scenario API
(`scenarios/task` `statisticsReport`, the context's `editorialStatsEmail`
on), the context holding one submission received on the 15th of the
previous month and one account per role. The "Journal manager",
"Journal editor", "Production editor", "Section editor" and "Guest
editor" accounts (OMP "Press manager", "Press editor", "Production
editor", "Series editor"; OPS the "Preprint Server manager" and
"Moderator") each got one email,
subject "Editorial activity for August, 2026" (OPS "Preprint Server
activity for August, 2026") with `editorial-report.csv` attached,
Mailpit's text rendering ending "—" then "Unsubscribe ( {link} ) from emails sent by
{journal name} ( {link} ).", and the `List-Unsubscribe` headers; and one
Tasks row, its sentence as in Rule 6 and an empty title cell; on OJS
and OPS the task's own recipient list (`notified`, `mailed`) held those
accounts and `admin` (enrolled as manager; its shared mailbox not read),
OMP's run answering no list (below). Pressing
it followed `mark-read?redirect=1` to `{context}/stats/editorial`,
heading "Editorial Activity", the bell "1" before and none on the next
page. The Author, Reader, Copyeditor, External Reviewer and Funding
coordinator (OJS, OMP), the Volume editor (OMP) and the Editorial Board
Member (OPS) got neither. A Section editor and a Production editor (OPS a
second Preprint Server manager) who had unticked "Enable…" on
"Statistics report summary." and saved got neither the email nor the
task, and were left out of the recipient list. On OMP the scenario
request got no answer in both runs: the `php -S` process died with
"Segmentation fault" (exit 139, the PHP 8.3 OPcache crash of the test
server's runtime, not an application path) after the Tasks job had run;
the reserved mail job, released and run with `php lib/pkp/tools/jobs.php
work --stop-when-empty`, sent the emails as above. Live-probed 2026-09-28 on OJS, OMP and OPS (Rule 6: the
"needs an editor" row's "Who is told"; the "Discussion added." row's
task): `AssignEditors` picks its recipients with
`filterByRoleIds([ROLE_ID_MANAGER])`. On scratch contexts a seeded
submission (`submitted: true`, task only) and a wizard submission (task
and email) raised the task for the "Journal manager", "Journal editor"
and "Production editor" accounts (OMP "Press manager", "Press editor",
"Production editor"; OPS the "Preprint Server manager") and for `admin`,
enrolled as a manager, and the wizard's email "A new submission needs an
editor to be assigned: "{title}"" reached the same accounts; the "Section
editor" (OMP "Series editor", OPS "Moderator"), the "Copyeditor" (OPS
"Editorial Board Member"), the Author and the Reader got neither. The
OPS task reads "…a moderator needs to be assigned." while the email's
subject says "an editor". The discussion task's message is
`QueryNotificationManager::getNotificationMessage()`'s
`Str::limit(PKPString::html2text($note), 200)`; html2text turns the
message's paragraph into text with one leading line break, which counts
against the 200. Opening messages of 150, 198, 199, 200, 201 and 300
characters sent through Participants › "Notify" (predefined message
"Discussion (Submission)", OPS "Discussion (Production)"), and one of
300 through "Assign", showed 150 and 198 whole, 199 whole followed by
"...", and 200 or more as their first 199 characters followed by "...";
each discussion email carried the whole message. A 300-character string
with no space in it ran past the window's right edge unmarked on one OJS
run; a 150-character address with hyphens and slashes wrapped and showed
whole on all three apps.
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS and OMP, two runs each (Rule 6, the
reviewer-comment row's "Who is told"): the review stage's Participants ›
"Assign" offered the roles "Journal editor, Section editor, Guest editor,
Funding coordinator, Translator, Author" (OMP "Press editor, Series
editor, Funding coordinator, Author, Volume editor, Translator"), no
Journal (Press) manager; with a Journal (Press) editor and a Section
(Series) editor assigned, both got the review-complete email and two
unassigned Journal (Press) Managers got none. The recipient list reads
the review stage's assignments (`withStageIds`), and the "Journal
manager" group has no stages: a participant seeded as `manager` is
listed on no stage's panel and got no email (one OJS run). Live-probed
2026-10-20 on OPS, two runs (Rule 6's closing list): a real post
("Post the preprint" › "Post") sent an author with "Do not send me an
email…" ticked under "A new version of your submission, "Title", was
published." "New Version Posted Acknowledgement" alone, and an author at
the defaults "New Version Posted Acknowledgement" and "Publication
Published"; on OJS (Publication › "Publish", no issue) and OMP the
box-ticked author got neither email and the other "Publication
Published" alone. Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs
each (Settings, the announcements switch): with the journal's "Enable
announcements" unticked the side menu offered no "Announcements" link,
the page at `{journal}/management/settings/announcements` still offered
"Add Announcement", and an announcement saved there with "Send an email
about this to all registered users." ticked (POST 200) emailed the
Reader, the Author and the Section Editor with the footer "Unsubscribe
from emails sent by {journal name}."; the email's "Visit our website to
read the full announcement" link, opened signed out, answered "404 Not
Found", as did `{journal}/announcement`. Every notification email read
on 2026-10-20 is HTML only (note f).

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — Link: `PKPNotificationOperationManager::getUnsubscribeNotificationUrl()`
→ `{context}/notification/unsubscribe?validate=<JWT>&id=<notificationId>`;
the token is `JWT::encode(["unsubscribe-{contextId}-{userId}-{notificationId}"],
api_key_secret)`, so it is per notification and never expires (Rule 7b);
`createUnsubscribeToken()` returns '' when `[security] api_key_secret` is
empty (A6), and `Unsubscribe::headers()` adds `List-Unsubscribe` and
`List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` only when the URL is set
(Rule 7c). Footer texts: `emails.footer.unsubscribe`, `.automated`,
`.discussion` in `lib/pkp/locale/en/emails.po`. Page:
`pages/notification/NotificationHandler::unsubscribe()` — GET displays
`PKPNotificationsUnsubscribeForm` (`notification/unsubscribeNotificationsForm.tpl`,
strings `notification.unsubscribeNotifications` "Unsubscribe",
`.pageMessage`, `.resubscribe`; one checked box per entry of
`getNotificationSettingsMap()`, unfiltered by context: A9, OPS1); POST
`validate()` (`FormValidatorPost`, `FormValidatorCSRF`: A5) then `execute()`
replaces `blocked_emailed_notification` for the notification's user and
context with the ticked boxes (Rule 8c, A2); the result template branches on
`$unsubscribeResult` between `.success`/`.successMessage` and
`.error`/`.errorMessage`. `_validateUnsubscribeRequest()` throws
`NotFoundHttpException` for a missing token or id, an unknown notification
(A7: `Notification::delete()` from the grid) or a token that does not
verify. No role policy on the handler: `PKPHandler::authorize()` adds none
for anonymous visitors (Actors row 5). `{url page="user" op="profile"}` is
the Identity tab (Rule 8e). Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS
(Rules 7a–7c, 8a–8e; Fields "The Unsubscribe page"; Actors row 5;
scenarios 5, 6; A2, A7, A9) from a scratch discussion's email: Mailpit's
text rendering ends "—" then "Reply to this comment at #32 Author ( {workflow
address} ) or unsubscribe ( {link} ) from emails sent by Scratch context
{tag} ( {home} )." (OMP, OPS: "#6 Author"; the number is the submission id,
"Author" the seeded contributor's family name); the HTML has the three
links; Mailpit's headers show `List-Unsubscribe` and
`List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`. Signed out, the link
answers the reader-facing page (title "Unsubscribe | {journal}") with the
boxes in the order Fields lists (11 on OJS, 9 on OMP and OPS), every box
checked; the button posts to the same address and the success page
follows, "user profile" linking to `{context}/user/profile`; the link
reopened shows the page again with every box ticked. A row switched off
on the tab came back ticked on the page, and "Unsubscribe" with that box
unticked switched it back on while switching every other row off (A2). A
Journal Manager signed in opened the Author's link: the Author's address
on the page, the Author's tab rewritten, the Manager's own untouched. With
the task deleted from the Tasks panel the link answered the bare "404 Not
Found" page, signed in or out (A7); so did the link with `validate` or `id`
cut off, or with an unknown `id`. With the context set to "Do not send the
email to editors." the page still listed "Statistics report summary." (A9).
Signed out, "user profile" led to Login and then to the Profile page on
"Identity". The error branch (Rule 8d) was reached two ways on every app:
the page left open after the browser's cookies were cleared, and the page
left open in one tab while the person signed in and out again in another,
then "Unsubscribe" pressed on the old page (the `FormValidatorCSRF` check
fails; the POST answers 200 with the `.error` template: heading "We could
not unsubscribe you", text as quoted); the link opened afresh showed the
form again. Mailpit's "Text" tab shows its own text rendering of the
HTML, each link's address in parentheses after the link's words.
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each (Rules 7a,
8d): every notification email read (discussion, announcement, issue,
review-complete, statistics, "needs an editor", "Publication Published")
is a single `text/html` part, the statistics email `multipart/mixed` with
`text/html` and the CSV (Mailpit's `/api/v1/message/{id}/raw`); Mailpit's
"Text" tab and its API's `Text` field are Mailpit's rendering. The
discussion footer read "Reply to this comment at #147 Author" on a
one-author submission and "#148 Author et al." with a second
contributor; its "#{number} {authors}" link opened the workflow for the
Journal Manager and refused the Author (A16). An Unsubscribe page opened
signed out, then a sign-in alone in a second tab, then "Unsubscribe" on
the old page: "You have been unsubscribed", the header then showing the
signed-in Reader; signed in then signed out in the second tab, and
cookies cleared: "We could not unsubscribe you". The authors left out for an anonymous reviewer: at pkp/pkp-lib#13636's
head `631be03740` (issue pkp/pkp-lib#12879), before its merge, read and
live-probed 2026-10-28 on OJS, OMP and OPS
(`checks/sync/pkp-lib-13636/walk.js`): `TemplateVariables` (the
`Discussion` trait) passes the submission to
`Unsubscribe::setupUnsubscribeFooter()`, which blanks `{$authors}` and
`{$authorsShort}` when any recipient holds a
`SUBMISSION_REVIEW_METHOD_DOUBLEANONYMOUS` review assignment on the
submission, whatever its round, stage or state. A discussion the Section
Editor opened with an accepted reviewer: under "Anonymous
Reviewer/Anonymous Author" the reviewer's mail read "Reply to this
comment at #8 or unsubscribe …", its link text "#8 " (OMP "#11 "),
and nothing else in the mail named the author; the Section Editor's own
copy and their mail of the reviewer's reply read "#8 Author"; the
reviewer's copy of their own reply was blanked too; a cancelled request
of that type blanked it; "Anonymous Reviewer/Disclosed Author" and
"Open" kept "Author"; a discussion with the Author on OPS kept it. At
the apps' `lib/pkp` 67d844dfc0, the same walk had every one of those
mails read "#{n} Author". The stable-3_4_0 and stable-3_5_0 ports
(pkp/pkp-lib#12882, #12884) merged 2026-06-12.

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — `layouts/backend.tpl` `.app__notifications` renders `Page.vue`'s
`notifications` array; `pkp.eventBus.$on('notify', (message, type))` pushes an
entry with `expire: Date.now() + 5000`, cleared every 250 ms unless the
container matches `:hover`; `Notification.vue` renders `pkpNotification--{type}`
with a dismiss button labelled `common.close`. Server-side trivial
notifications (`NOTIFICATION_TYPE_SUCCESS`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `FORBIDDEN`,
`INFORMATION`, `HELP`, `FORM_ERROR`, NOTIF-001..007 in the atlas) are fetched
by `SiteHandler.js` on load when `hasSystemNotifications` and on `notifyUser`
events through `notification/fetchNotification`, which deletes them once
fetched, and mapped in `showNotification_()`: `notifySuccess` → `success`;
`notifyWarning`, `notifyError`, `notifyFormError`, `notifyForbidden` →
`warning`; everything else → `notice`. `PKPNotificationManager::getNotificationMessage()`
falls back to `common.changesSaved` for a success without contents;
`FORM_ERROR`'s title is `form.errorsOccurred`. In-place notices
(`controllers/notification/inPlaceNotification.tpl`) are the legacy forms'
own rendering. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS (Rule 9): the
save on Profile › "Notifications" gave
`.pkpNotification--success` at top 56 px, 8 px from the right edge, white
with a `rgb(0, 178, 78)` left border, "Your changes have been saved.";
its close button shows "×" with the screen-reader text "Close"; two saves
in a row stacked the second below the first; with the pointer resting on
it for 10 s it stayed and went within 0.3 s of the pointer leaving.
Unhovered, the toast went 5.3 s after appearing, on all three apps
(the code's 5 s plus the 250 ms sweep). Ticking
"Custom Block Manager" on Settings › Website › "Plugins" gave
`.pkpNotification--notice` with a `rgb(0, 103, 152)` left border, "The
plugin "Custom Block Manager" has been enabled.", no page reload. A wrong
current password on the "Password" tab gave no toast: the in-form
`div.notifyFormError` with the bold "Errors occurred processing this form"
and "The current password you entered was incorrect." removed itself 6.7 s
after the press. No probed screen produced a message across a full-page
load (checked again 2026-09-04 on every screen this spec drives).
Live-probed 2026-09-28 on OJS, OMP and OPS (Rule 9a, the warning look;
Rule 9b): on a scratch submission's Participants panel, a row's "More
Actions" › "Notify" with "Message" empty and "Notify" pressed kept the
side panel open and gave `.pkpNotification--warning` with a
`rgb(208, 10, 108)` left border and the text
`stageParticipants.notify.warning` "Please ensure that you have filled
out the message field and included someone other than yourself in the
discussion.", a toast on OPS too; the Profile › "Notifications" save
toast's left border read `rgb(0, 178, 78)` again. The "×" removed a
toast shown with no window open within 0.11–0.14 s (the save toast on
all three apps; "Notification sent to users." after a sent "Notify" on
OJS and OMP); over the open side panel it did not (A14).
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each (Rule 9b):
the "Add a Component" window after "Save" with -survey in "Key" showed
the warning toast (left edge `rgb(208, 10, 108)`) "The key can contain
only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens, and must begin
and end with an alphanumeric character.", which stayed 8 s under the
pointer and went at a press on its "×", the window open.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `RegistrationForm::execute()`: when a context is open and
`emailConsent` is unticked, every type of the `notification.type.public`
category is written to `blocked_emailed_notification` for the new user and
that context; nothing is written when the box is ticked. *Registration &
account validation* note e traced the same code. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on
OJS, OMP and OPS (Rule 5e, scenario 8): a scratch context's Register page
with `emailConsent` unticked signed the visitor in at once ("Registration
complete", no email; the fleets do not require validation) and the tab
showed "Do not send me an email…" ticked on every "Public Announcements"
row ("New announcement." alone on OMP, "A new announcement has been
created." alone on OPS) with
"Enable…" ticked; a second registration with the box ticked left every
box at its default.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — `editorialStatsEmail` (context setting; Settings › Workflow ›
"Emails" › "For Editors" › "Editorial statistics", radios "Send a monthly
email to editors." / "Do not send the email to editors."; live-probed
2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS: the second radio saved through `POST
…/api/v1/contexts/{id}` dropped the row from the tab, the first restored
it; the description mentions "the journal" on OMP and OPS too).
`[security] api_key_secret` is
`"Api_Key_Secret_For_Testing_Purposes_Only"` on the fleets
(`shared/playwright/make-test-config.js`). `[interface] items_per_page = 25`
(`config.TEMPLATE.inc.php`). `scenarios/context` `editorialStatsEmail:
false` stores "Do not send the email to editors."; live-probed 2026-10-20
on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each: such a journal's tab has no
"Statistics report summary." row and `scenarios/task` `statisticsReport`
notifies and mails nobody (`jobs` 0), while the same run mails the
editors of a journal with the email on.

<a id="fn-s0"></a>
**s0** — Ready accounts: `manager.maya` (Journal Manager),
`sectioneditor.ana`, `author.alex`, `reader.rosa`; the password is the
username twice; `admin`/`admin` is the Site Administrator. Scratch journals,
throwaway users and submissions come from the scenario API (`POST
scenarios/context`, `scenarios/submission`; users.md, scenarios.md). The
mail catcher is Mailpit at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`, scoped by recipient
address (PRINCIPLES A8). The job runner is off on the fleets: an email or
notification produced by a queued job (announcements, issues, the statistics
report) needs `runJobs()` in the serial project before it can be asserted
(by hand: `php lib/pkp/tools/jobs.php run` from the application's root,
the command `runJobs()` wraps), and its links carry the config `base_url`
host; the "needs an editor"
email, the discussion email, the review-complete email and the tasks in scenarios 1–6, 10 and 11 are sent inside the request (0.2–0.4 s on 2026-09-04) with links on the request host; scenario 10's task comes from the seed itself (note s10).
The job runner prints one "Processing:" / "Processed:" pair per job with
the job's name (`NewAnnouncementNotifyUsers`, `IssuePublishedNotifyUsers`)
and ends "[OK] Completed running N jobs in the queue named queue."; before
it runs the mailbox holds nothing for the event (2026-09-04, all apps).
Mailpit's "Text" tab shows its own text rendering of the HTML-only
message, each link's address in parentheses after the link's words
(note f, 2026-10-20). The wizard on a
scratch context (2026-09-04, all apps): "Begin Submission" wants the
title, the checklist box and the privacy box; the files step a file with
its genre; the details step the abstract on OJS and OPS (the default
section requires it; not on OMP) and on OPS the "For Readers" step's
"Relation status" radio (the suites pick "This preprint has not been
published elsewhere."); the footer's "Submit"
opens a dialog whose button is "Submit".

<a id="fn-s1"></a>
**s1** — A scratch context whose sections have no assigned editors (the
default of `POST scenarios/context`; the section form's "Editorial
Assignments" box confirmed empty 2026-09-04); the throwaway manager must
hold the `manager` role there, and `admin` is auto-enrolled as a manager
and gets the task too. `POST scenarios/submission` with `submitted: true`
raises the task but sends no email (the request runs under
`Mail::fake()`), so a scenario that reads a mailbox drives the wizard; the
wizard's final "Submit" raises both. Expected task text per app: Fields,
"Submission Events", third row. Landing on 2026-09-04: OJS and OMP
`{context}/dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId=<id>` (heading = the
author's name; the trailing query part after the id came and went between
runs, so only the path and `workflowSubmissionId` are asserted); OPS
`{context}/user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.workflowStageRequired`
(OPS3). The reader-side count is read on the scratch context's home page (`{context}/index`), `#navigationUserWrapper` `span.task_count` beside the name, and the entries under the name are the seeded user menu ("Dashboard", "View Profile", note c); after the task is opened the same page shows "0". The margin of the row is the strip of the `td` below the row's one `<a>`, which spans the cell's full width (`task.tpl`, note a): live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each, at 1280 px the link runs from x 171 to 1264, 44 px high in a 59.5 px cell; a press at x ≈ 1234 on the sentence's line, right of the sentence's end (x ≈ 690–727), left the window for the workflow (OJS, OMP) or the denied page (OPS), and a press 4 px inside the cell's bottom-right corner (the suites' `pressBlankPart`) left the window open, the row unread and the address unchanged. The suites press the sentence first and then, on the row now read, the blank space at x ≈ 1234 on the sentence's line. The narrow window is the test's own viewport, set below 992 px (no seed key): the header's "Open Menu" lists the bare name and the user menu with `span.task_count` after "Dashboard" (note c); the viewport is set back to 1280 px before the Tasks window is opened.

<a id="fn-s2"></a>
**s2** — Two tasks from two submissions on the same scratch context; the
unread look is `div.task.unread` in `task.tpl`. Driven 2026-09-04 on all
three apps as written. Newest first is the grid's creation-date order (note a): the later submission's title is the first row. The order is stamped to the second: on OMP on 2026-09-13 two seeded submissions landed inside one second and the earlier's row came first on two runs of three, and on 2026-10-20 same-second ties showed on all three apps (note f-a12), so the suites seed the second submission after the clock's next second and the green runs on all three apps list the later one first (A12). The control is a second throwaway `manager` of the same context (`admin` also qualifies), whose two rows survived the first Manager's "Delete" on 2026-09-04 (note a). The "Select" header without a box and the Escape key closing the panel are note a's reads of the grid; each row's box is the positive control for the header's empty cell.

<a id="fn-s3"></a>
**s3** — Box names: `notificationEditorAssignmentRequired` and
`emailNotificationEditorAssignmentRequired`. The email is
`SubmissionNeedsEditor` (template `SUBMISSION_NEEDS_EDITOR`, from
`admin@mail.test`). Toast: `common.changesSaved`. Driven 2026-09-04 on all
three apps: Manager A's mailbox held exactly that email (A10). Every
Manager of the scratch context already holds a needs-editor row from each
earlier submission (a seeded `submitted: true` submission raises the row
too), so the assertion is "no row for this title and the badge unchanged",
never "No Items". The toast bullet is note g's probe: two saves in a row stacked the second below the first, the dismiss button shows "×" with the screen-reader text "Close", and the toast stayed under the pointer and went 0.3 s after it left. The control's second submission may be `POST scenarios/submission` with `submitted: true`, which raises the row without an email (seed-facts); only the row is read.

<a id="fn-s4"></a>
**s4** — Same accounts and box names as s3. Driven 2026-09-04 on all three
apps: Manager A's mailbox count stayed at its earlier total while Manager
B's email for the new title arrived. The Section Editor is a `sectionEditor` in the context's `users[]` (on OPS the same key seeds a Moderator, scenarios.md). The assignment goes through the Participants panel's "Assign" on screen (*Stage participants*' window), never through the submission's `participants[]`: a seeded editor leaves the "needs an editor" rows in place, where the screen's "Assign" deletes them (scenarios.md). Every Manager of the context already holds rows from earlier submissions, so the windows are read by the submission's title, never by count. The Rule 5c bullets read no mailbox while "Enable…" is unticked, since the "needs an editor" email arrives regardless (A10); the second submission goes through the wizard, as a seeded one sends no email (note s1).

<a id="fn-s5"></a>
**s5** — The discussion is added through the workflow's tasks & discussions
manager (`[data-cy="discussion-manager"]`, button "Add",
`input[name="title"]`, `input[name="participants"]`, TinyMCE for the
message; `POST …/api/v1/submissions/{id}/tasks`), which emails every
participant with `TemplateVariables` and the
`emails.footer.unsubscribe.discussion` footer; the participant boxes load
a moment after the form opens and only users on the submission plus the
opener are offered. Leaving the workflow page after the save raises the
browser's leave-page prompt. The link is
`{context}/notification/unsubscribe?validate=…&id=…`. On OMP and OPS at
the 2026-09-02 pkp tips the save fails with `Class
"APP\notification\Notification" not found` until the campaign's overlay
class is mounted (`docs/tracking/app-changes.md` row 12; the fleets run
with it). Driven 2026-09-04 on all three apps up to and including the
second discussion, with the Manager's own copy as the control. The email's From name is the Manager's (`From.Name` asserted by the three suites; the address was not recorded). The three broken links are Rule 8a's, built from the emailed address (`validate` cut, `id` cut, `id=999999999`), each answering the bare "404 Not Found" page signed in or out (note f). The text read is Mailpit's "Text" tab, its rendering of the HTML-only email (note s0). "No email confirms it": `count()` on the Author's address stays at 1 after the press. The "user profile" link on the form page is `{context}/user/profile`; signed out it led to Login and then to "Identity" (note f). The toast over the "Notify" side panel is Rule 9a's warning, the panel and its wording *Stage participants*' (its scenario 6); only the hover, the toast's going and the open panel are this scenario's, read as scenario 3's toast is (note g).

<a id="fn-s6"></a>
**s6** — Accounts of its own, so the Author's tab is at its defaults (scenario 5's Author has every email box ticked and gets no discussion email). The second author is a `contributors[]` entry on `POST scenarios/submission` (scenarios.md), added after the submitter, so the Author stays the first author; the discussion is added as in note s5. The "#{submission number} {authors}" link is read, not pressed (A16). The sign-in in another tab is a second Playwright page in the same browser context, the form left open in the first. The addressee is `Notification::userId` of the link's notification;
the page's sentence prints `$userEmail` from that user, whatever the session.
Driven 2026-09-04 on all three apps as written. The stale page: the form left open in one Playwright page while the same browser context signs out in another, then "Unsubscribe" pressed on the old page; the `FormValidatorCSRF` check fails and the POST answers 200 with the `.error` template (note f, 2026-09-04, all apps); the link opened afresh after a new sign-in shows the form again. The "user profile" link on the result page is the same `{context}/user/profile`, the signed-in Manager's own Identity tab.

<a id="fn-s7"></a>
**s7** — `manager.maya` on `publicknowledge`; `editorialStatsEmail` is on by
default (seed-facts). Site-level address: `index/user/profile`, opened as
`admin`: `manager.maya` holds a role in one journal only and is forwarded
(*User profile* A1), and a scratch context must exist so the site has
several journals. Driven 2026-09-04 on all three apps: rows as in Fields;
`admin`'s site-level tab without the statistics row. The site's own home page is `index/en`: `manager.maya` shows the bare name there; `admin` the bare name and the count in the text of the "Dashboard" entry of the drop-down under it ("Dashboard 46" on 2026-09-04, "Dashboard 15" on 2026-09-13; its `span.task_count` is `display: none` at desktop width, note c, A13), asserted from the entry's text content as the number the bell shows on `admin`'s editorial pages, never as a fixed value and never as visible. The bell on `index/user/profile` opens the same grid (`TaskNotificationsGridHandler` with no context filter, note a); the first row's text is compared with the one the seeded journal's editorial page gives. The narrow read is the test's own viewport below 992 px on `index/en`: after "Open Menu" the entry's `span.task_count` is displayed, its number read between two reads of the bell, since parallel workers move `admin`'s count (note c).

<a id="fn-s8"></a>
**s8** — The Register page of a scratch context (registration open by
default, seed-facts); box `input[name=emailConsent]`. Box names on the tab:
`emailNotificationNewAnnouncement`, and on OJS `emailNotificationPublishedIssue`,
`emailNotificationOpenAccess`. Driven 2026-09-04 on all three apps (note h). The reader-side read: the scratch context's home page as the newly registered account (a Reader): the bare name, as for `reader.rosa` (note c).

<a id="fn-s9"></a>
**s9** — OJS only: `IssueGridHandler::publishIssue()` with
`sendIssueNotification` (`notification.sendNotificationConfirmation`, checked by
default in `assignPublicIdentifiersForm.tpl`); the job `IssuePublishedNotifyUsers` needs
`runJobs()`. The Reader's box: `notificationPublishedIssue`. The dialog's other
labels belong to *Issues*. Driven 2026-09-04 on OJS: on Issues › Future
Issues the "Publish Issue" link is folded under the row's expander arrow
(not visible until the arrow is pressed); the dialog's box arrives
ticked and its confirm button is "OK"; an issue with no articles
published without a warning ("0" items); the Author's email (subject "Just
published: Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026): {title} of {journal name}", the issue's
identification "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026): {title}" as the list shows it) carries
the footer, the Reader with "Enable…" unticked
got none; OMP and OPS have no issue rows (note d).

<a id="fn-s10"></a>
**s10** — `POST scenarios/submission` with `submitted: true, published: true`
and the throwaway author as `submitter` raises the Author's "A new version
of your submission…" task on all three apps (note e, 2026-09-04) and sends
no email (the scenario request runs under `Mail::fake()`, seed-facts), so
the scenario reads the task only; the "Publication Published" email and its
missing footer are A8's, seen after a real publish through the workflow on
OMP and OPS (note f-a8). The row is `div.task.unread` whose `span.message`
reads `A new version of your submission, "{title}", was published.` with
no `.details .submission` line under it (test runs of 2026-09-13 on OJS,
OMP and OPS: the aria snapshot's row holds that one link and nothing
else); the notification's `assocType` is `ASSOC_TYPE_PUBLICATION`, which
`NotificationsGridCellProvider::_getTitle()` has no case for, so no title
line is built. The three suites assert the full sentence and the absence of the title
line, with the Manager's "needs an editor" row and its title line as the
positive control. The seed also raises the "needs an editor" task for every
Manager of the context (seed-facts), which is the control's positive half:
the Manager's window lists that row for the title and none opening "A new
version of your submission".

<a id="fn-s11"></a>
**s11** — OJS and OMP only (OPS has no reviewer role and rejects
`reviewRounds`, scenarios.md). Context `users[]`: a `manager`, a
`sectionEditor`, an `author` and an `externalReviewer`; `POST
scenarios/submission` with `decisions: ['sendExternalReview']`,
`reviewRounds: [{reviewers: [{username: <reviewer>, status: 'accepted'}]}]`
and `participants: [{username: <section editor>, role: 'sectionEditor'}]`
(the stage assignment the recipient list reads: assigned
`ROLE_ID_MANAGER`/`ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, note e; the throwaway Manager and
`admin` are managers of the context but not assigned, and got nothing on
2026-09-04). The Reviewer's steps are *Reviewer's review*'s: the assignment
opened from the reviewer's list, the wizard to step 3 (a seeded `accepted`
assignment opens on step 1, scenarios.md), on OJS "Recommendation" set to
"Accept Submission", "Submit Review", then "OK" in the "Confirm" window.
The email is `ReviewCompleteNotifyEditors`, From "Site Admin
<admin@mail.test>", in the Section Editor's mailbox 0.3 s after "OK" on
2026-09-04 (OJS and OMP), Mailpit's text rendering ending "—" then "This is an automated
message from {journal name} ( {home} ). You can unsubscribe ( {link} ) from
this email at any time.", with the `List-Unsubscribe` headers; the Section
Editor's Tasks window unchanged and the Manager's mailbox without it (note
e). {OMP} "recommends None" in the subject. The Section Editor's window
holds no row with the submission's title at all: the "needs an editor"
task the seed raised went to the manager-level accounts alone
(live-probed 2026-09-28, note e).

<a id="fn-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_QUERY_ACTIVITY` (`0x1000022`) is defined, mapped
(`getNotificationSettingsMap()`, `QueryNotificationManager`) and listed, but
grep over `lib/pkp` and the three app trees finds no `createNotification()`
or `updateNotification()` with it; discussion replies
(`EditorialTaskController`, `Repository::addNote…`) raise nothing of that
type. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS: the Author's reply (`POST
…/api/v1/submissions/{id}/tasks/{n}/notes`) gave the Manager a new
`TASK` row whose text was the opening row's ("{opener} started a
discussion: {name}: {opening message}", a new notification id) and an
email from the Author with the reply and the discussion footer; with the
Manager's "Enable…" unticked under "Discussion activity." a second reply
did the same. Re-driven 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS with the overlay
of note s5 mounted: the Author's reply reached the Manager as a task row
and an email on all three apps, with "Discussion activity." unticked
making no difference; the controller is shared and neither app overrides
it.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#848](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/848) ([docs/issues/U05-A1-discussion-activity-choice-governs-nothing.md](../issues/U05-A1-discussion-activity-choice-governs-nothing.md)).

<a id="fn-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — `PKPNotificationsUnsubscribeForm::execute()` calls
`updateNotificationSubscriptionSettings('blocked_emailed_notification',
$emailSettings, …)`, which deletes the user's existing rows for that context
before inserting the ticked boxes; the template checks every box
(`checked="checked"`). Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS (note f):
a row switched off on the tab came back ticked on the page, and
"Unsubscribe" with it unticked switched it on again on the tab.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#850](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/850) ([docs/issues/U05-A2-unsubscribe-page-reenables-emails.md](../issues/U05-A2-unsubscribe-page-reenables-emails.md)).

<a id="fn-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — Note c: the role list in `getDisplayStatus()` omits
`ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS: a scratch
Section Editor (Series Editor, Moderator) with the bell at "Tasks 1" from a
discussion shows the bare name on the journal's home page; `manager.maya`
and `author.alex` show "0" there without a task.
Issue report: [docs/issues/U08-A2-section-editor-dashboard-opens-profile.md](../issues/U08-A2-section-editor-dashboard-opens-profile.md), filed as [pkp-e2e#634](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/634).
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each (note c): the
OJS "Guest editor" reads as the Section editor, the bare name at 1280 px
and a bare "Dashboard" at 800 px; every other role at the Journal
Manager, Assistant, Reviewer or Author level read "{name} 0". The 3.0 /
3.1 history comes from the code's change history, not a drive.

<a id="fn-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — `PKPNotificationSettingsForm::fetch()` with `$context === null`
reads and writes `context_id` null; `PKPAnnouncementController::notifyUsers()`
is called only for context announcements ("There is no way to determine
users who have subscribed to site-level announcements"); no other emitter
in note e runs without a context. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and
OPS: Administration › Site Settings › "Announcements" › "Announcements" ›
"Add Announcement" with "Send an email about this to all registered users."
ticked (`POST …/index/api/v1/announcements` 200) queued no job ("No jobs
available to run"), sent nothing to a Reader, a Manager or
`admin@mail.test`, and left the Reader's window at "No Items".

<a id="fn-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — `Unsubscribe::headers()` sets `List-Unsubscribe-Post:
List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` (RFC 8058), whose POST carries only
`List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` as the body; `NotificationHandler::unsubscribe()`
runs `validate()` with `FormValidatorCSRF`, which fails without the session
token, and renders the error branch. Cannot be driven through the
application's screens. Seen 2026-09-04: Mailpit shows the header as an
"Unsubscribe" line on the message but offers no one-click button, so
nothing could be pressed on the test installs either. Settling
observation: a mail program with a working one-click "Unsubscribe"
pressed on one of these emails, then the addressee's tab.

<a id="fn-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — Note f: `createUnsubscribeToken()` returns '' for an empty secret,
`getUnsubscribeNotificationUrl()` still builds the URL with `validate=`,
and `_validateUnsubscribeRequest()` throws `NotFoundHttpException` for an
empty token. `Unsubscribe::headers()` skips the headers only when
`unsubscribeUrl` is empty, and the URL is never empty (only its token is),
so the headers carry the dead link too. `config.TEMPLATE.inc.php` ships
`api_key_secret = ""` and nothing under `classes/install` sets it, so a
fresh install's file has it empty until the administrator edits the line.
Fixed on the fleets by `make-test-config.js`; not probeable there:
read from the code and the shipped file, and no screen shows the secret.

<a id="fn-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — `NotificationsGridHandler::deleteNotifications()` calls
`Notification::delete()`; `_validateUnsubscribeRequest()` answers 404 for a
missing id. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS with a discussion
email: the task deleted from the panel, the footer link answered the bare
"404 Not Found" page, signed in and signed out. The statistics report
(read 2026-09-29, not driven): `StatisticsReportMail::handle()` creates a
`NORMAL`-level `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_EDITORIAL_REPORT` row per recipient and
passes it to `allowUnsubscribe()`, while the Tasks row is a separate
`TASK`-level row from the job `jobs/notifications/StatisticsReportNotify`
(note e); deleting the task would leave the link's row in place.
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS (two runs each on OMP and
OPS, one on OJS): after the Journal Manager deleted "This is a kind
reminder for you to check your publication's health through the
editorial report." from the Tasks window, the statistics email's
"Unsubscribe" link still opened the page (200) naming the Manager's
address.

<a id="fn-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — `SubmissionNeedsEditor` and `AuthorPublicationPublished` extend
`Mailable` without the `Unsubscribe` trait and their emitters never call
`allowUnsubscribe()` (note e), while `EditorAssigned` (the auto-assignment
email) is the same. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS for the
needs-editor email: no "—" line, no "unsubscribe" wording, no
`List-Unsubscribe` headers in Mailpit. The "Publication Published" email
was seen the same day on OMP and OPS after a Manager published through
the workflow (note e): subject "Publication Published", From "{journal
name} <admin@mail.test>", ending with the item's public address, no "—"
line, no unsubscribe wording, no `List-Unsubscribe` headers, and the
Author's Tasks window holding "A new version of your submission…".
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each: an author who
had ticked and saved "Do not send me an email…" under "A new version of
your submission, "Title", was published." got the task and no
"Publication Published" email after a publish through the workflow (OJS
Publication › "Publish", no issue), while the control author got both;
on OPS the box-ticked author still got "New Version Posted
Acknowledgement" (Rule 6).

<a id="fn-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — `PKPNotificationsUnsubscribeForm::fetch()` assigns the whole
`getNotificationSettingsMap()` as `emailSettings`; the tab filters through
`getNotificationSettingCategories($context)`. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on
OJS, OMP and OPS on a scratch context set to "Do not send the email to
editors.": the tab's "Editors" group held one row, the page still 11 (OJS)
or 9 boxes ending "Statistics report summary.".

<a id="fn-a10"></a>
**f-a10** — `observers/listeners/AssignEditors` creates the `TASK`
notification through `PKPNotificationOperationManager::createNotification()`,
which returns null for a type in `blocked_notification` (Rule 5a), then
mails `SubmissionNeedsEditor` to every manager after its own check of
`BLOCKED_EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_KEY` only, so the "Enable…" box never reaches
the mail branch; the announcement and issue emails did stop with
"Enable…" unticked on the same day's probe (note e). Live-probed
2026-09-04 on OJS, OMP and OPS: a Manager with "Enable…" unticked and saved
(email box greyed, unticked after reload) had "No Items" and "0 - 0 of 0
items" after the Author's wizard submission, and exactly one email in the
mailbox, subject "A new submission needs an editor to be assigned:
"{title}"", from "Site Admin <admin@mail.test>"; the same Manager with
"Enable…" and the email box both ticked got the task and no email (Rule
5b).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#846](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/846) ([docs/issues/U05-A10-needs-editor-email-ignores-notification-off.md](../issues/U05-A10-needs-editor-email-ignores-notification-off.md)).

<a id="fn-a11"></a>
**f-a11** — `SubEditorsDAO::assignEditors()` assigns the section's
configured editors and, for each, creates a
`NOTIFICATION_TYPE_SUBMISSION_SUBMITTED` notification at
`NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_NORMAL` (not `TASK`, so no row in the Tasks grid) and
sends the `EditorAssigned` mailable (owned by *Stage participants*; no
`Unsubscribe` trait, so no footer and no `List-Unsubscribe` headers); with
no assignment, `observers/listeners/AssignEditors` raises the
`NOTIFICATION_TYPE_EDITOR_ASSIGNMENT_REQUIRED` task for every manager and
sends `SubmissionNeedsEditor` (note e). The assignment fails off the
install's first context because `assignEditors()` filters against the
user-group collection's array indexes instead of its group ids
(*Submission wizard* A8, live-probed 2026-08-25: two scratch journals
assigned nobody, the seeded first journal assigned and emailed all three
configured editors). Live-probed 2026-09-04 on OJS and OPS (Rule 6's
"A new article, "Title," has been submitted." row): on a scratch context
the section form (Settings › Journal › "Sections" › Edit "Articles"; OPS
"Preprints") showed the Section Editor ticked under "Editorial
Assignments" ("Assign … as Section editor"; OPS "as Moderator"); the
Author's wizard submission gave that editor no email within 8 s (mailbox
count unchanged) and a Tasks panel reading "No Items", while every
Manager got the needs-editor task and email. OMP not driven: a scratch
press has no series to tick an editor on. The first-journal half was not
driven in this spec (the seeded journal is read-only for campaign work),
so the `EditorAssigned` email's subject and the editor's panel there are
read from the mailable and the level above, not seen; the settling
observation is an editor assigned automatically on the install's first
journal, then their Tasks panel and mailbox read.

<a id="fn-a12"></a>
**f-a12** — `TaskNotificationsGridHandler::loadData()` orders by
`Notification::CREATED_AT` descending (note a); the column is a datetime
stamped to the second and the query has no secondary key. Test run
2026-09-13 on OMP (scenario 2): two `POST scenarios/submission` calls back
to back produced `notifications` rows 246 and 255 with equal
`date_created`; the window listed the earlier submission's title first on
runs 2 and 3 and the later's on run 1. The suites now seed the second
submission after the clock's next second (the condition the order depends
on) and the green runs on OJS, OMP and OPS list the later one first.
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each: two Authors'
wizard "Submit" pressed at once raised tasks in the same second on OMP
in both runs and on OPS in one (OJS one second apart in both); the
window listed the earlier first on OMP r1 and OPS r1, the later first on
OMP r2. 26 seeded submissions on each app: rows of one second came in an
order that held across reloads but was neither oldest- nor newest-first
(OJS r1 second :55 listed 927, 943, 935).

<a id="fn-a13"></a>
**f-a13** — `dashboardMenuItem.tpl` prints `<span class="task_count">`
after "Dashboard" (note c); the default theme's `head.less` sets
`> li > ul a .task_count { display: none; }` inside
`@media (min-width: @screen-desktop)` (992 px) and, outside it,
`> li > a .task_count { display: none; }` with
`> li > ul a .task_count { display: inline-block; }`. Test run 2026-09-13
on OJS (scenario 7, viewport 1280×900): with the menu open the
"Dashboard" link measured 130×30 px and its `span.task_count` ("15";
"1" for a scratch Manager on a journal's home page) computed
`display: none` with a zero-size box; the name link on the site's home
page has no `span.task_count` at all (`admin`, `manager.maya`). OMP's
`head.less` is identical and OPS's differs only in link colours (files
compared 2026-09-13). The narrow layout, live-probed 2026-10-13 on OJS,
OMP and OPS `main` at 800 px after "Open Menu", two runs each: `admin`'s
entry displayed "Dashboard 1" / "Dashboard 2", equal to the bell, span
`inline-block` (note c). Open (the cause): the site's languages are
`fr_CA` and `en` on every test fleet, and `getDisplayStatus()` lets a
site admin through as it lets a manager; unticking French as a site
language is site-wide and was not done on the shared fleet. Settling
observation: `admin`'s name on `index/en` of an install whose site
languages are English alone.
A site with English as its only language cannot be made on a shared
test install: unticking French under Administration › Languages also
strips French from every journal's languages
(`AdminLanguageGridHandler::_updateContextLocaleSettings()`), which
ticking it back does not undo (traced in the code, 2026-10-20). Traced
in the code, not driven: with no journal in the request, the form
languages the navigation menu's title code loops over
(`setAllNMILocalizedTitles()`) are the site's languages, `fr_CA` and
`en` on the fleets, the same condition as A15's. The settling
observation needs a fleet of its own.

<a id="fn-a15"></a>
**f-a15** — Live-probed 2026-10-13 on OJS, OMP and OPS `main`, two runs
each with the same result (note c): on a scratch context with
`supportedFormLocales` `['en','fr_CA']` the user-menu name's `innerHTML`
is the bare username for the Journal Manager, the Editor (not OPS), the
Reviewer (not OPS), the Author and the assistant (Copyeditor; Editorial
Board Member on OPS), with no `span.task_count`; the "Dashboard" entry
carries `<span class="task_count">` (`display: none` at 1280 px,
`inline-block` at 800 px). Unticking French under "Forms" on Setup ›
"Languages" put "username <span class="task_count">2</span>" back in the
name on the next page; ticking it again took it out. First seen
2026-10-03 on the default dataset's journal as `dbarnes` (French under
"Forms" there), where taking French out of the form languages in the
database brought the count back. Ticking French under "Forms" also logs
five script errors,
[Languages and locales](U57-languages-and-locales.md#a5) A5, unrelated
to the count. Not traced: `dashboardMenuItem.tpl`, the
default theme's `head.less` and `getDisplayStatus()`'s title and role
code are unchanged from `stable-3_5_0`, which therefore likely behaves
the same (code read, not driven); a 3.5 drive settles it.

**f-a16** — The discussion footer's "#{number} {authors}" link
(`emails.footer.unsubscribe.discussion`, the `Discussion` trait, note e)
is the editorial workflow address
`{context}/dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}`. Live-probed
2026-10-20 on OJS, OMP and OPS, two runs each: signed in as the
submission's Author (the Author role alone), the link answered
`user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.roleBasedAccessDenied`,
the page reading "The current role does not have access to this
operation."; signed in as the Journal Manager, the same link opened the
submission's workflow.

<a id="fn-a14"></a>
**f-a14** — While the "Notify" side panel is open, the page body,
`.app__notifications` and the toast's close button compute
`pointer-events: none`, and `elementFromPoint` at the "×"'s centre
returns the window's own `div.flex.items-start`; so neither the press
nor the container's `:hover` (note g) reaches the toast, and the 5 s
expiry runs on. Live-probed 2026-09-28 on OJS, OMP and OPS, four runs
each (Rule 9b): Participants › a row's "More Actions" › "Notify" with
"Message" empty gave the warning toast over the open side panel; a mouse
press at the "×"'s centre left it in place, the pointer resting on the
"×" throughout, and the toast went by itself 5.1–5.3 s after it showed;
Playwright's locator click timed out after 3 s ("… intercepts pointer
events") with the same lifetime; the side panel was still open
afterwards. Controls with no window open: the "×" removed the Profile ›

users." after a sent "Notify" (OJS, OMP; on OPS that notice can land in
the Production entry's own "Notification" box instead, *Stage
participants* OPS4) within 0.11–0.14 s. The "Add a Component" window's
refused key shows the same (*Submission intake configuration* A13).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#826](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/826), closed 2026-10-06 with the fix.
Retired 2026-10-06: at ui-library `a36dc7fe78` (ojs `d7cf416029`, omp `a0e6d0a8bc`, ops `7e34fdd57e`) `.app__notifications` computes `pointer-events: auto` over an open window, so the press and the container's `:hover` reach the toast, and the side window ignores a press inside `.pkpNotification`; the report's kept walk on the dataset fleet, all three apps: the "Notify" warning gone 0.16–0.19 s after a press on its "×", the panel open; the refused key's notice kept for 8 s under a resting pointer.

**f-ops1** — OPS's `NotificationSettingsForm` and `NotificationManager` do not
override the categories or the map (chain check); OPS has no reviewer group
(seed-facts) and no review stage, and `EditorialReminder` is not scheduled on
OPS (*Submissions dashboard* note n). Live-probed 2026-09-04: both rows on
the OPS tab for `manager.maya`, `admin` and a scratch Author, and both
boxes on the OPS Unsubscribe page.

<a id="fn-ops2"></a>
**f-ops2** — `ops/locale/en/locale.po` `notification.type.submissionSubmitted`:
`"A new preprint , \"{$title}\", has been submitted."`. Live-probed
2026-09-03 and 2026-09-04 on the OPS tab (every role driven) and on the OPS
Unsubscribe page; the second comma sits outside the quotes, unlike the OJS
and OMP rows.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#851](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/851) ([docs/issues/U05-OPS2-preprint-submitted-row-space-before-comma.md](../issues/U05-OPS2-preprint-submitted-row-space-before-comma.md)).

<a id="fn-ops3"></a>
**f-ops3** — `TaskNotificationsGridHandler` `markRead` with `redirect=1`
answers a redirect to `PKPNotificationManager::getNotificationUrl()`, which
for a submission notification builds
`{context}/dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId=<id>` on every app; on
OPS that address answers
`user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.workflowStageRequired`
(the message of `WorkflowStageRequiredPolicy`: no stage in the address), a
front-end page whose body is `user.authorization.workflowStageRequired`
"A workflow stage was not specified.". Which OPS handler applies that
policy to the dashboard address was not traced. Live-probed 2026-09-04 on
OPS with the needs-editor task,
pressing the sentence and the title alike; `dateRead` was set (no badge
afterwards, the row read). OJS and OMP land on
`dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId=<id>…` with the workflow panel
open. Not seen on the discussion or "published" tasks; same redirect.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#847](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/847) ([docs/issues/U05-OPS3-ops-task-link-workflow-stage-not-specified.md](../issues/U05-OPS3-ops-task-link-workflow-stage-not-specified.md)).
Live-probed 2026-10-20 on OPS, two runs: the needs-editor email's
subject reads "A new submission needs an editor to be assigned:
"{title}"", and its link `…/dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId=<id>`
opened as the Preprint Server Manager lands on the workflow over the
submissions list (`workflowMenuKey=workflow_5`).
