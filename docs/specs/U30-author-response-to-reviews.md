# Author response to reviews {OJS}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

Once the reviews of a round are in, an editor can ask the author for a
formal written response to them, in one place, before deciding. The editor
sends the request as an email from a dedicated page; the author answers
through a window on their own view of the review stage, saying which of the
submission's contributors the response speaks for; editors read the
response on the same stage and may correct or remove it. One response
exists per review round. This spec covers the editor's "Author Response"
table, the "Request Author Response" page and its email, the author's
"Author Response" card and the response window, on OJS. The round the
response belongs to is
[→ review stage & rounds](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#rounds); the
reviews it answers are completed in *Reviewer's review* and read by the
editor in
[→ reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#read-review).

A press installs the same code but shows none of it on the workflow
screen: neither the editor's "Author Response" table nor the author's
"Author Response" card appears on the External Review or Internal Review
stage, whatever the round's state. The "Request Author Response" page
still opens by its address (Rule 14) and sends its email, and the Request
Revisions decision email still carries a "Submit Author Response" button;
both land the author on a workflow screen with nothing to respond in
⚠ [OMP1](#omp1). A preprint server has no review stage, so no round exists
to respond to: a preprint's Production stage shows no "Author Response"
table, and the request page's address shows the access-denied page, reading
"A workflow stage was not specified." for the Preprint Server Manager and a
Moderator and "The current role does not have access to this operation."
for the Author. <sup>a</sup>

## Actors & permissions

**Terms used below.** An **assigned author** is an Author listed on the
review stage's Participants panel: the submitting author always, a
co-author only once an editor assigned them there (*Stage participants*).
A **contributor** is a name on the submission's Contributors list, with or
without an account. The **editorial roles** of this spec are Journal
Manager, Editor, Site Administrator, and Section Editor and Guest Editor
assigned to the review stage; the Funding Coordinator, the one
assistant-level role that reaches the review stage
([→ stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-access)),
is named where it differs. Who opens the review stage at all is the review
stage spec's row "Open the review stage". <sup>a</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **See the "Author Response" table** (editorial view of the review stage) | • Editorial roles; Funding Coordinator when assigned: on every round, always (Rule 1) <sup>c</sup> |
| **Request a response** ("Request Response" → the "Request Author Response" page) | • Editorial roles: while the round is ready (Rule 3) and holds no response<br>• Funding Coordinator: the button is offered like everyone else's, but pressing it shows the access-denied page instead of the request page ⚠ [A3](#a3) <sup>e</sup> |
| **See the "Author Response" card** (author view) | • Assigned author: while the round is in one of the three states of Rule 6 <sup>h</sup> |
| **Submit a response** | • Assigned author: once per round, while the card offers "Submit Response" (Rules 6, 8); any assigned author may, naming the contributors it speaks for <sup>j</sup> |
| **Read a submitted response** | • Assigned author, the submitter or another: "View Submitted Response" on the card (Rule 9)<br>• Editorial roles; Funding Coordinator: row action "View" on the row of the author who submitted it (Rule 10) <sup>k</sup> |
| **Edit a submitted response** | • Editorial roles: "Save" in the "Author Response to Reviews" window (Rule 10)<br>• Author: never; the window says so (Rule 9)<br>• Funding Coordinator: the window opens with the editors' note, but in place of "Save" it shows a "Submit Response" button that stays greyed [A3](#a3) <sup>k</sup> |
| **Delete a submitted response** | • Editorial roles: row action "Delete" (Rule 11)<br>• Funding Coordinator: the action is offered like everyone else's, but "OK" in its dialog is refused with the dialog "Error" / "The current role does not have access to this operation." and the response stays [A3](#a3) <sup>l</sup> |
| **Open the request page by its address** | • Editorial roles who may open the submission: the page opens for any of its rounds (Rule 14)<br>• Everyone else (an unassigned Section Editor or Guest Editor, Funding Coordinator, Author, Reviewer, Reader): the access-denied page (Rule 14) <sup>o</sup> |

## Fields & validation

The request page is an email editor; the response window is a two-field
form. Both are listed here.

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "To" (request page) | fixed | The assigned authors, one chip per person; there is no box to add anyone (Rule 13) <sup>f</sup> |
| "Add CC/BCC" → "CC", "BCC" (request page) | no | Pressing "Add CC/BCC" replaces the button with two empty boxes, "CC" and "BCC"; email addresses typed there, comma-separated, go on the email <sup>f</sup> |
| "Subject" (request page) | yes | Prefilled "Request For Author Response To Reviewer Feedback" from the template; emptied, "Submit Request" is refused with a generic "Error" dialog (Rule 4a) ⚠ [A5](#a5) <sup>f</sup> |
| "Message" (request page) | yes | Rich text (bold, italic, superscript, subscript, link) prefilled from the "Request Author Review Response" template (Rule 4), with the "Submit Author Response" button and the reviewers' comments (Rule 5) already in it; emptied, "Submit Request" is refused the same way [A5](#a5) <sup>f</sup> |
| "Attach Files" (request page) | no | A toolbar button opening the "Attach Files" window with four sources: "Upload File", "Submission Files" (the author's files from the submission stage), "Review Files" (files uploaded by this round's reviewers) and "Library Files" <sup>f</sup> |
| "Author Response" (response window) | yes | Rich text (bold, italic, underline, bullet list), one box per form language of the journal; the submit button stays greyed while it is empty <sup>b</sup> |
| "Authors" (response window) | yes, at least one | One checkbox per contributor of the submission, described as "Author contributors who this response is being submitted on behalf of."; an assigned co-author who is not on the Contributors list has no box; the submit button stays greyed while none is ticked <sup>b</sup> |

## Rules & state

<a id="panels"></a>
1. **Where the feature lives.** In the editorial view of the review stage,
   each round shows a table headed "Author Response", described "Invite the
   author to respond to reviewer feedback before moving forward", after the
   Reviewers panel and before the discussions. It has one row per assigned
   author, columns "Author" and "Response Status", and the header button
   "Request Response"; once a response exists, a third column without a
   visible heading holds the row actions of Rule 10. In the author view
   the same stage ends with a card
   headed "Author Response", and only in the states of Rule 6; a round in
   any other state shows the author no card at all. <sup>c</sup>

<a id="status"></a>
2. **"Response Status"** reads one of three things:

   | Cell | When |
   |------|------|
   | "Awaiting reviews" | The round is not ready (Rule 3) |
   | "Ready to invite author" (shown with every word capitalised, "Ready To Invite Author") over "Editor can now request the author's response." | The round is ready and holds no response |
   | "A response was submitted by {name}" | A response exists; {name} is the person who submitted it |

   Every author row shows the same cell: the status is the round's, not
   the person's. <sup>d</sup>

<a id="ready"></a>
3. **When "Request Response" is enabled.** The round is **ready** when it
   has at least one reviewer whose request was not declined or cancelled
   ⚠ [A8](#a8), and every such reviewer has submitted their review
   ("Review Submitted",
   "Review Viewed", "Complete" or "Reviewer Thanked" in the Reviewers
   panel); a round with no reviewer is not ready. With "Minimum Confirmed
   Reviews Required" above 0 (Settings › Workflow › Review › "Setup";
   *Review setup & review forms*), the round is also ready as soon as that
   many reviews stand "Complete" (the editor's "Mark as Complete" in Read
   Review, confirmed with "Mark as Complete" in the dialog "Mark this
   review as complete?"), whatever the other reviewers have done. "Request Response" is
   greyed until the round is ready and again once a response exists.
   Sending a request changes nothing on this table: the cell still reads
   "Ready to invite author" and the button stays enabled, so the next press
   sends a second request; only the author's "Notifications" list shows
   every send ⚠ [A1](#a1). <sup>e</sup>

<a id="request-page"></a>
4. **The "Request Author Response" page.** "Request Response" leaves the
   workflow screen for a full page headed "Request Author Response" (the
   browser tab shows the journal's name), with the line "You’re about to
   email the author to request a response to the completed reviews. Use
   the template below or customize your message as needed" and the
   breadcrumb Dashboard › "{family name}, {submission title}" › Request
   Author Response. Under the heading "Modify email shared with the user"
   (shown in capitals) sit "Templates to get you started!" with its "Find
   Template" box, the language switch ("Switch to French" on the seeded
   journal) and the email editor of Fields, prefilled from the "Request
   Author Review Response" template. "Cancel" returns to the workflow
   screen with the round open, nothing sent. "Submit Request" sends the
   email (Side effects) and shows the dialog "Request for review response
   sent" / "The author of the submission, {submission title}, have been
   notified and asked to submit their response to the reviewers' comments."
   with one link, "View Submission Summary", which returns to the workflow
   screen on the round. The dialog has no close button; Escape closes it
   and lands on the same screen. <sup>f</sup>

4a. **Refusals at "Submit Request".** Every refusal is a dialog headed
   "Error" with one button, "OK", and the page keeps what was typed:

   - an emptied "Subject" or "Message": "An unexpected error has occurred.
     Please reload the page and try again.", with nothing under the field
     to say what is wrong ⚠ [A5](#a5);
   - a round that is not ready (Rule 3): "This review round has review
     assignments that needs to be completed before a response can be
     requested from the Author.";
   - a round that already holds a response, whether or not every review is
     in: "Unable to complete the intended action on resource.".

   The last two are met only through a typed address (Rule 14), because
   the button is greyed in both states. <sup>f</sup>

<a id="email"></a>
5. **What the email says.** Subject "Request For Author Response To
   Reviewer Feedback". The body opens "Hello {author name}," naming every
   assigned author, comma-separated, in no fixed order; says "All peer
   reviews for your
   submission titled "{submission title}" have now been completed." and
   invites a response, shows the button "Submit Author Response" (Rule 7)
   and then, under a line, "The following comments were received from
   reviewers." followed by one block per completed review of the round:

   - the heading: "Reviewer 1:", "Reviewer 2:" … for anonymous reviews,
     numbered in the order the message lists them, which does not follow
     the Reviewers panel and can differ from one opening of the page to
     the next; or the reviewer's name alone for a review conducted openly;
   - "Recommendation: {the reviewer's recommendation}";
   - the text the reviewer wrote "For author and editor"; for a review on
     a review form, instead, each question marked "Included in message to
     author" as a line of its own with its answer as the paragraph under
     it, the other questions absent.

   A second line and "Kind regards," over the sender's name close the
   body. Reviews still outstanding and declined or cancelled requests
   contribute nothing [A8](#a8), and under a minimum (Rule 3) the opening sentence
   still says every review is in ⚠ [A6](#a6). A reviewer's uploaded files
   are not attached by themselves; the editor picks them under "Attach
   Files". The editor may rewrite any of this before sending. <sup>g</sup>

<a id="card"></a>
6. **The author's card.** The "Author Response" card appears on a round
   when any of three things holds: a request was sent for it (Rule 4); its
   status reads "Revisions have been requested."; or the submission was
   accepted from it with "Accept Submission", in which case the round's
   status box reads "The submission is currently in the Copyediting
   stage." for the author and the editor alike
   ([→ round status](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#round-status)). Until
   a response exists it reads "Respond to Reviews" with the button "Submit
   Response"; afterwards "A response was submitted by {name}" with "View
   Submitted Response". The Request Revisions decision email carries the
   same "Submit Author Response" button as the request email, so an author
   asked for revisions can respond without a separate request; that
   email's subject is "Your submission has been reviewed and we encourage
   you to submit revisions" <sup>f-omp1</sup>. Once shown, the card stays
   on a requested round: a request is remembered even after the response is
   deleted (Rule 11). The card a Request Revisions decision brings is not
   remembered: once the author uploads a revision, the round's status reads
   "Revisions have been submitted and a decision is needed." and the card
   is gone until an editor sends a request ⚠ [A7](#a7). <sup>h</sup>

<a id="link"></a>
7. **The email's button.** "Submit Author Response" opens My Submissions
   with the submission's workflow open on the review stage, that round
   selected, and the response window (Rule 8) already open once the screen
   has loaded; a signed-out author passes through Login first and lands on
   the same screen with the window open. Closing the window leaves the
   screen on the round, and a reload does not reopen the window
   ([→ deep links](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#deep-link)).
   <sup>i</sup>

<a id="author-window"></a>
8. **Writing the response.** "Submit Response" opens a side window titled
   "Submit Your Response to Reviewer Feedback" whose intro reads "All
   reviews for your submission have been completed. Please review the
   comments and provide a written response to the reviewers. You can
   address their suggestions, clarify any points, and indicate any
   revisions you plan to make. Your response will be shared with the
   editorial team and may be sent back to reviewers if needed." Under it
   the two fields of Fields, then "Submit Response" (greyed until both are
   filled) and "Cancel" (closes, nothing kept). "Submit Response" closes
   the window with no message; the card flips to "A response was submitted
   by {name}" (Rule 6), and in the editor's table every author row shows
   the same cell and gains a "More Actions" button ("…") (Rule 10). The
   response belongs to the round: a second assigned author sees the
   flipped card with "View Submitted Response" only and cannot add a
   response of their own. <sup>j</sup>

<a id="author-reread"></a>
9. **Re-reading as the author.** "View Submitted Response" opens the same
   window with the intro "A review response has been submitted and is
   displayed below. This response cannot be edited by authors. If you
   would like any changes, please contact the assigned editor." The text
   and the ticked contributors are shown in the two fields, which still
   accept typing and unticking; "Submit Response" stays greyed whatever is
   changed in them, and "Cancel" closes with nothing saved. <sup>j</sup>

<a id="editor-window"></a>
10. **Reading and editing as an editor.** Once a response exists, every
    author row ends in a "More Actions" button ("…") with "View" and
    "Delete" (in red); both are greyed on every row except the one of the
    person who submitted the response. "View" opens the side window
    "Author Response to Reviews" with the note "The following response was
    submitted by the author, {name}. Editors may review the response and
    make edits if necessary.", the two fields editable, and "Save" and
    "Cancel"; "Save" greys while no "Authors" box is ticked. "Save"
    replaces the text and the ticked contributors and closes the window
    with no message; the author's "View Submitted Response" then shows the
    edited version, still headed with the original submitter's name. An
    assigned Funding Coordinator is offered the same row actions
    [A3](#a3). <sup>k</sup>

<a id="delete"></a>
11. **Deleting.** "Delete" opens the dialog "Delete" / "Are you sure you
    wish to delete this item? This action cannot be undone." with "OK" (in
    red) and "Cancel". "OK" removes the response, and the table catches up
    on its own a few seconds after the dialog closes: every row returns to
    "Ready to invite author" (Rule 2), the "…" buttons go, and "Request
    Response" is enabled again. The author's card returns to "Respond to Reviews"
    with "Submit Response": because the round remembers the request (Rule
    6), the author may submit a new response without being asked again.
    "Cancel" changes nothing. <sup>l</sup>

<a id="rounds"></a>
12. **Rounds.** Each round carries its own request and its own response.
    A new round starts at "Awaiting reviews" and shows the author no card,
    while the earlier round keeps whatever card it had (its status box for
    the author then reads "The submission has been advanced to the next
    round of review"). A past round keeps its response, readable through
    the same "View" once that round is chosen in the workflow menu, and
    its "Request Response" still follows Rule 3, so a response can be
    requested for a past round whose reviews are complete and that holds
    none. Nothing on the Copyediting or Production stage shows a response.
    <sup>m</sup>

<a id="recipients"></a>
13. **Who is asked, who is named.** The request goes to every assigned
    author of the review stage as one email: "To" lists them, one chip
    each, and cannot be edited, and the greeting names them all, in no
    fixed order ("Hello Alex Author, Bea Author," in one run, "Hello Bea
    Author, Alex Author," in another). With "Notify All Authors" at its default
    (Settings › Workflow › Emails, under "Editorial Decisions": "Send an
    email notification to all authors of the submission."), every other
    contributor who has an email address also receives a copy (Side
    effects). The "Authors" boxes of the response window list the
    submission's contributors, account or not, so a response can speak
    for a contributor who was never emailed, while an assigned co-author
    who is not a contributor has no box. <sup>n</sup>

<a id="by-address"></a>
14. **By address.** The request page's address is
    `{journal}/reviewResponse/requestAuthorResponse?stageId=3&reviewRoundId={round}&submissionId={id}`
    (3 is the review stage). An editorial role who may open the submission
    gets the page for any of its rounds; named with a round that does not
    exist or belongs to another submission, the access-denied page reads
    "Invalid review round.". Every other role (a Section Editor or Guest
    Editor not assigned to the submission, Funding Coordinator, Author,
    Reviewer, Reader) gets the access-denied page "The current role does
    not have access to this operation."; the review stage itself is not
    shown. A page reached by a typed address (not through "Request
    Response") has nowhere to return to: "Cancel" lands on a page reading
    only "404 Not Found"; "Submit Request" sends the email all the same,
    but the dialog's control reads "View Submission" and does nothing, and
    Escape lands on the same "404 Not Found" page ⚠ [A4](#a4).
    <sup>o</sup>

## Side effects

- **The request email** "Request For Author Response To Reviewer Feedback"
  (Rule 5) goes to the assigned authors from the editor who pressed "Submit
  Request", with the CC, BCC and attachments typed on the page. It is
  recorded as an email the editor sent the author: the author's
  "Notifications" list on the review stage gains one row per send, and
  each row opens the "Notifications" window with the email as sent, its
  button working
  ([→ the "Notifications" list](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#author-emails)).
  <sup>p</sup>
- **A copy to the other contributors.** With "Notify All Authors" at its
  default, each contributor who has an email address and is not an assigned
  author receives an email with the same subject. Its body opens "The
  following email was sent to {author} from {journal} regarding
  "{submission title}"." and "You are receiving a copy of this notification
  because you are identified as an author of the submission. Any
  instructions in the message below are intended for the submitting author,
  {author}, and no action is required of you at this time.", then the
  editor's message, button included (the "Notify Other Authors" template,
  *Emails management*). Switched to "Only send an email to authors assigned
  to the submission workflow. Usually, this is the submitting author.",
  nobody else is mailed. <sup>p</sup>
- **The round is marked as asked.** After "Submit Request" the round
  remembers the request for good: the author's card shows from then on
  (Rule 6), even after a deletion (Rule 11). <sup>h</sup>
- **No task, no notification.** The author gets no task and no in-app
  notification; the email is the only notice. Submitting, editing or
  deleting a response sends no email and raises no task or notification for
  anyone: the header's "Tasks" panel stays at "No Items", the dashboard row
  does not change, and an editor learns of a response only by opening the
  round ⚠ [A2](#a2). <sup>p</sup>
- **The activity log** gains an email row "An email has been sent: Request
  For Author Response To Reviewer Feedback" per send, and no row for the
  response, its edit or its deletion (*Submission activity log & notes*).
  <sup>p</sup>
- **A flag for the article page.** When every review of the round was
  conducted with its comments publicly visible ("Publicly Show Reviewer
  Comments", *Review setup & review forms*), the response is marked as
  public for the article page's display of the peer reviews (*Article
  landing page & reading*); nothing on the workflow screen shows the flag.

## Cross-feature interactions

- **Review stage & rounds** owns the round, its status sentences (Rule 6
  reads two of them), the author view this card sits in, and the
  "Notifications" list where the request email is re-read.
- **Reviewer assignment & management** owns the Reviewers panel whose row
  statuses define "ready" (Rule 3) and the "Mark as Complete" that counts
  under "Minimum Confirmed Reviews Required".
- **Reviewer's review** owns the wizard that produces the completed reviews
  the email quotes (Rule 5); the scenarios here start from reviews already
  in.
- **Review setup & review forms** owns "Minimum Confirmed Reviews
  Required", "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments", the review type and review
  forms; this spec states only their effect on Rules 3 and 5.
- **Editorial decision recording** owns the Request Revisions and Accept
  Submission decisions and their emails; this spec keeps one line: the
  revisions email, and the "Notify Authors" message it is written in, carry
  the "Submit Author Response" button (Rule 6).
- **Workflow screen & stage access** owns the stage-set gate behind the

## Canonical scenarios

The scenarios run on the seeded journal with ready accounts and scratch
submissions; the one that raises "Minimum Confirmed Reviews Required"
runs on a scratch journal configured for it, with throwaway accounts; the
press and preprint-server absence runs on the seeded press and preprint
server with ready accounts. A review that is "in" is a completed
review the scenario starts from. Each email is read in the mailbox of the
address it was sent to. Accounts, passwords and the tooling recipe are in
the footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **From "Awaiting reviews" to a sent request**: Editor, with two
   submissions in review, the first with one Reviewer who accepted the
   request and has not reviewed, the second with its one review in,
   recommending "Revisions Required" with the comment "The method needs a
   control group.": open the first submission's review stage. After the
   Reviewers panel the table "Author Response" lists one row, the Author,
   whose "Response Status" reads "Awaiting reviews", and "Request Response"
   is greyed. Open the second submission's review stage: the row reads
   "Ready to invite author" over "Editor can now request the author's
   response." and "Request Response" is enabled. Press it: the page
   "Request Author Response" opens with the Author as the one chip in
   "To" and no box to add anyone, "Subject" reading "Request For Author
   Response To Reviewer Feedback", and "Message" holding the "Submit
   Author Response" button, "The following comments were received from
   reviewers.", "Reviewer 1:", "Recommendation: Revisions Required" and
   "The method needs a control group.". Press "Cancel": the workflow
   screen shows the round again and no request reaches the Author's
   mailbox. Press "Request Response" again, then "Submit Request": the
   dialog "Request for review response sent" opens, and its link "View
   Submission Summary" returns to the round, where the row still reads
   "Ready to invite author" and "Request Response" is still enabled
   ⚠ [A1](#a1). In the Author's mailbox the email "Request For Author
   Response To Reviewer Feedback" opens "Hello {author name},",
   says "All peer reviews for your submission titled "{submission title}"
   have now been completed.", shows the "Submit Author Response" button,
   then the same reviewer block, and closes with "Kind regards," over the
   Editor's name. Author: open the second submission's review stage from
   My Submissions: the "Notifications" list holds one row for that email,
   and the stage ends with the card "Author Response" reading "Respond to
   Reviews" with "Submit Response". Control: the first submission's review
   stage shows the Author no "Author Response" card.

2. **The author responds from the email**: Author, signed out, with
   scenario 1's request sent and its email in their mailbox: press
   "Submit Author Response" in the email. The Login page shows; sign in:
   My Submissions opens with the submission's workflow on the review
   stage, the round selected, and the window "Submit Your Response to
   Reviewer Feedback" already open, its intro opening "All reviews for
   your submission have been completed.". Press "Cancel": the window
   closes and the screen stays on the round; reload the page: no window
   opens, and the card "Author Response" reads "Respond to Reviews" with
   "Submit Response". Press "Submit Response": the window opens again with
   "Submit Response" greyed. Type "We added a control group." in "Author
   Response": still greyed. Under "Authors" ("Author contributors who this
   response is being submitted on behalf of.") tick the one box, the
   Author's own name: "Submit Response" is enabled. Press it: the window
   closes with no message and the card reads "A response was submitted by
   {name}", {name} being the Author, with "View Submitted Response". Press
   "View Submitted Response": the window opens with the intro "A review
   response has been submitted and is displayed below. This response
   cannot be edited by authors. If you would like any changes, please
   contact the assigned editor.", the text and the tick shown; type
   "More." after the text and untick the box: "Submit Response" stays
   greyed; press "Cancel". Editor: open the round: the Author's row reads
   "A response was submitted by {name}" and ends in a "More Actions"
   button ("…"), and the header's "Tasks" panel reads "No Items". Control:
   the Editor's mailbox holds no email about the response and the
   submission's dashboard row is unchanged ⚠ [A2](#a2).

3. **The editor edits, deletes, and the author answers again**: Journal
   Manager, with scenario 2's response on the round: open the round and
   press "…" › "View" on the Author's row. The window "Author Response to
   Reviews" opens with the note "The following response was submitted by
   the author, {name}. Editors may review the response and make edits if
   necessary.", the text and the ticked box, and the buttons "Save" and
   "Cancel". Untick the box: "Save" greys; tick it again, replace the text
   with "We added a control group and a power analysis." and press
   "Save": the window closes with no message. Author: on the round press
   "View Submitted Response": the window shows "We added a control group
   and a power analysis." and the card still reads "A response was
   submitted by {name}", the Author's own name. Journal Manager: press "…"
   › "Delete" (in red): the dialog "Delete" / "Are you sure you wish to
   delete this item? This action cannot be undone." opens with "OK" (in
   red) and "Cancel". Press "Cancel", then "…" › "Delete" › "OK": within a
   few seconds the row reads "Ready to invite author", its "…" is gone and
   "Request Response" is enabled. Author: the card reads "Respond to
   Reviews" with "Submit Response", with no new request in the mailbox or
   the "Notifications" list; press it, type "We have reworked the
   analysis." in "Author Response", tick the box and press "Submit
   Response": the card reads "A response was submitted by {name}" again.
   Journal Manager: the row reads "A response was submitted by {name}"
   with its "…" back, and the submission's activity log holds one row "An
   email has been sent: Request For Author Response To Reviewer Feedback"
   and no row for the response, its edit, its deletion or the second
   response. Control: "Cancel" in the "Delete" dialog left the row reading
   "A response was submitted by {name}" with its "…" in place.

4. **Revisions requested: the card without a request, and the co-author's
   response**: Author and a second assigned author (a co-author with an
   account who is not on the Contributors list), with a submission whose
   round has its one review in and a Request Revisions decision recorded,
   and no request sent: the co-author opens the review stage from My
   Submissions. The status box reads "Revisions have been requested." and
   the stage ends with the card "Author Response" reading "Respond to
   Reviews" with "Submit Response". Press it: under "Authors" the only box
   is the Author's name, the co-author having none; type "We will add the
   control group." in "Author Response", tick the box and press "Submit
   Response": the card reads "A response was submitted by {name}", {name}
   being the co-author. Author: open the same round: the card reads "A
   response was submitted by {name}" with "View Submitted Response" only
   and no "Submit Response". Journal Manager: open the round: the "Author
   Response" table has two rows, the Author and the co-author, both
   reading "A response was submitted by {name}" and each ending in "…";
   "View" on the co-author's row opens "Author Response to Reviews" with
   the note naming the co-author. Control: on the Author's row "View" and
   "Delete" are greyed, on the co-author's row both are enabled.

5. **One confirmed review is enough when the minimum says so**: Journal
   Manager, on a scratch journal with "Minimum Confirmed Reviews Required"
   set to 1 and a submission in review with two Reviewers, the first's
   review in recommending "Revisions Required" with the comment "Shorten
   the introduction." and the second's request accepted: open the round.
   The "Author Response" row reads "Awaiting reviews" and "Request
   Response" is greyed. In the Reviewers panel open the first reviewer's
   "Read Review", press "Mark as Complete" and confirm with "Mark as
   Complete" in the dialog "Mark this review as complete?": the row now
   reads "Ready to invite author" and "Request Response" is enabled while
   the second review is still due. Press "Request Response", then "Submit
   Request", and read the email in the Author's mailbox: it opens "All
   peer reviews for your submission titled "{submission title}" have now
   been completed." ⚠ [A6](#a6) and holds one reviewer block, "Reviewer
   1:", "Recommendation: Revisions Required" and "Shorten the
   introduction.". Control: the email holds no second reviewer block; the
   review still due contributes nothing.

6. **Who may request**: Section Editor and Funding Coordinator assigned to
   the review stage, Author and Journal Manager, with a ready round (its
   one review in) on a submission in the Section Editor's section: Section
   Editor: open the round: the "Author Response" table reads "Ready to
   invite author" and "Request Response" is enabled; press it: the page
   "Request Author Response" opens; press "Cancel": the round shows again.
   Funding Coordinator: open the round: the same table with "Request
   Response" enabled; press it: the access-denied page "The current role
   does not have access to this operation." shows instead of the request
   page ⚠ [A3](#a3). Author: type this round's request-page address (Rule
   14): the access-denied page "The current role does not have access to
   this operation." shows and the review stage does not. Journal Manager: type the
   address with a round number that does not exist: the access-denied page
   reads "Invalid review round.". Control: the Journal Manager typing the
   address with the round's real number gets the "Request Author Response"
   page (reached this way it has nowhere to return to ⚠ [A4](#a4)).

7. **A press and a preprint server** {OMP OPS}: Press Editor and press
   Author, with a monograph in External Review whose one review is in,
   revisions requested and the decision email in the press Author's
   mailbox; Preprint Server Manager, Moderator and preprint Author, with a
   submitted preprint: Press Editor: open the monograph's External Review
   stage: no "Author Response" table follows the Reviewers panel. Press
   Author: in the mailbox the email "Your submission has been reviewed and
   we encourage you to submit revisions" carries "Submit Author Response";
   press it: the monograph's External Review stage opens reading
   "Revisions have been requested." with no "Author Response" card and no
   window ⚠ [OMP1](#omp1). Preprint Server Manager: open the preprint's
   Production stage: no "Author Response" table; type the preprint's
   Rule 14 address (stage 3, round 1): the access-denied page "A workflow
   stage was not specified.". Moderator: the same address
   shows the same page. Preprint Author: the same address shows "The
   current role does not have access to this operation.". Control: the
   Press Editor typing the monograph round's address (Rule 14) gets the
   "Request Author Response" page with the press Author in "To"; the
   absence is the workflow screen's alone.

## Findings register

Verdicts are the author's judgment (claude, 2026-09-06), unreviewed unless
an entry notes otherwise; the team settles them on spec review.

user-visible. After "Submit Request" the editor expects the "Response
Status" cell to say the author was asked; it still reads "Ready to invite
author" and "Request Response" is enabled, so a colleague, or the same
editor after a reload, sends the request a second time with nothing on the
screen to stop them; a second and a third press are accepted and each
sends the email again. The author's screen does record every send (the
card appears and the "Notifications" list gains a row per email), so the
two views disagree. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a1</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — Nobody is told when the response arrives** · ❓ · user-visible. The
editor asks by email and is expected to notice the answer; the app sends no
email, raises no task and shows no notification when the author submits,
edits and deletions are not announced either, and the submissions
dashboard row does not change. The editor learns of the response only by
opening the round. Question: should a submitted response notify the
assigned editors (a task, an email, or a dashboard indicator)? Lean: yes,
at least an email, because the other author actions the editor waits for
do announce themselves: a discussion the author starts raises a task and
an email, and an uploaded revision the email "Revised Version Uploaded".
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a2</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — The Funding Coordinator is offered controls the app refuses** · 🐞
· minor. An assigned Funding Coordinator sees the "Author Response" table
with "Request Response" enabled on a ready round and, once a response
exists, "View" and "Delete" enabled in the row menu, exactly as an editor
does. Pressing "Request Response" shows the access-denied page "The
current role does not have access to this operation." instead of the
request page; "View" opens "Author Response to Reviews" with the note
promising that "Editors may review the response and make edits", but with
a greyed "Submit Response" where the editor has "Save"; "Delete" › "OK"
ends in the dialog "Error" / "The current role does not have access to
this operation." and the response stays. The expectation is that none of
the three is offered. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a3</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — A typed request-page address returns nowhere** · 🐞 · minor. The
request page reached from "Request Response" returns to the workflow
screen on "Cancel" and from the sent dialog. Reached by its typed address,
"Cancel" lands on a page reading only "404 Not Found"; "Submit Request"
sends the email, but the sent dialog's only control, "View Submission", is
plain text that does nothing, and Escape lands on the same "404 Not Found"
page, so the editor navigates back by hand. The same on a press, where the
page is reachable only this way. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a4</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — An emptied subject or message gets a generic error** · 🐞 · minor.
An editor who clears "Subject" or "Message" and presses "Submit Request"
expects the field to be marked as required; instead the dialog "Error" /
"An unexpected error has occurred. Please reload the page and try again."
appears, nothing under either field says what is wrong, and the advice to
reload would discard the message being written (the page itself keeps it
after "OK"). Basis: probe. <sup>f-a5</sup>

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — Under a minimum, the email says every review is in** · ❓ · minor.
With "Minimum Confirmed Reviews Required" at 1 and a second review still
due, the request email opens "All peer reviews for your submission titled
"{submission title}" have now been completed." and quotes the one confirmed
review, so the author is told the reviews are over while one is
outstanding. Question: should the template say only that the required
reviews are in when a minimum made the round ready? Lean: yes; the
sentence misstates the round, and the outstanding review's comments will
reach the author later, if at all, through a further request. Basis:
probe. <sup>f-a6</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — The decision email's "Submit Author Response" leads nowhere once revisions are uploaded** · 🐞 · user-visible.
An author asked for revisions
gets the email's "Submit Author Response" and the "Author Response" card on
the round, but if they upload their revised file first, the card disappears
with the round's new status "Revisions have been submitted and a decision
is needed.", and the email's button then opens the round with no card and
no window, so the response the email asked for cannot be written. The
editor's table meanwhile reads "Ready to invite author" with "Request
Response" enabled, so only a fresh request brings the card back (sending
that request was not tried). Basis: probe. <sup>f-a7</sup>

<a id="a8"></a>
**A8 — A cancelled reviewer's effect was not seen** · ❓ · minor. Rule 3
counts a cancelled request like a declined one, so a round with one
completed review and one cancelled request should read "Ready to invite
author", and Rule 5 leaves the cancelled reviewer out of the email; neither
was seen on a screen. Question: does "Cancel Reviewer" on the accepted
request of such a round leave the cell at "Ready to invite author" and the
request page with one reviewer block? Lean: yes; the app drops a cancelled
request wherever it drops a declined one. Basis: code. <sup>f-a8</sup>

### OMP

<a id="omp1"></a>
**OMP1 — The press's decision email offers a response with nowhere to go** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A press author asked for revisions receives the
"Submit Author Response" button in the decision email, like a journal
author (the editor sees it in the "Notify Authors" message before
recording). Pressing it opens the monograph's External Review stage, which
reads "Revisions have been requested." and shows "Revisions Uploaded" and
the "Notifications" list, but no "Author Response" card and no window, so
the author cannot do what the email asked. Neither review stage shows the
editor's "Author Response" table, so no request can be sent from a screen;
the "Request Author Response" page still opens by its address, sends the
request email (its reviewer block reading "Recommendation:" with nothing
after it, since a press collects none) and shows the sent dialog, and that
email's button lands the author on the same empty stage. Since: 2026-07-31
(seen on a press while the review stage was probed) · Basis: probe.

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — Roles. The request page `PKP\pages\reviewResponse\ReviewResponseHandler::__construct()` assigns `requestAuthorResponse` to `ROLE_ID_MANAGER`, `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR` and adds `SubmissionAccessPolicy`, `ReviewStageAccessPolicy` (the `stageId` query parameter) and `ReviewRoundRequiredPolicy`. The API `PKP\API\v1\reviews\PKPReviewController::getGroupRoutes()` gates `POST …/authorResponse/requestResponse`, `PUT …/authorResponse/{responseId}` and `DELETE …/authorResponse/{responseId}` on the same three roles and `POST …/authorResponse/` on `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR`; `authorize()` adds `SubmissionAccessPolicy`. Form requests: `AddResponse::passedValidation()` requires a `StageAssignment` with `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` on the round's stage, no existing `AuthorResponse` for the round (409 otherwise) and the round in `REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_REVISIONS_REQUESTED` / `REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_ACCEPTED` or `isAuthorResponseRequested`; `EditResponse::passedValidation()` requires an assigned `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, or the manager role in the context, or site admin. The "editorial roles" of the Actors table are the union of those three gates. Absence on OMP and OPS: `workflowConfigEditorialOMP.js` / `workflowConfigAuthorOMP.js` and the OPS pair (`lib/ui-library/src/pages/workflow/composables/useWorkflowConfig/`) never push `AuthorResponseRequestManager` or `AuthorResponseManager`, and `WorkflowPageOMP.vue` / `WorkflowPageOPS.vue` do not import them; only `WorkflowPageOJS.vue` and the OJS configs do. `api/v1/reviews/index.php` exists in OJS and OMP, not in OPS. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Actors rows 1–2, 8; the absence paragraph): `sectioneditor.ana` and `admin` see the table and open the page; `assistant.rita` (Funding Coordinator) is sent to `user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.roleBasedAccessDenied` from the button; on OMP neither `workflow_3_{round}` (External Review) nor `workflow_2_{round}` (Internal Review) renders the table for `editor.diana`, while the typed page renders and `POST …/requestResponse` answers 200; on OPS the typed address redirects to `user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.workflowStageRequired` for `manager.maya` and `sectioneditor.ana` (Moderator) and `…roleBasedAccessDenied` for `author.alex`, never a 404. With the preprint's own stage in the address (`stageId=5`) the Preprint Server Manager lands on `…invalidReviewRound` ("Invalid review round."); an Editorial Board Member and a Reader get the Author's page, "The current role does not have access to this operation." (scratch server, 2026-09-06).

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — The response form is `lib/ui-library/src/managers/ReviewRoundResponseManager/useAuthorResponseForm.js`: `addFieldRichTextArea('authorResponse', {toolbar: 'bold italic underline bullist', isRequired: true, isMultilingual: true, label: submission.reviewRound.authorResponse})` and `addFieldOptions('associatedAuthorIds', 'checkbox', {options: authorOptions (the publication's authors), label: submission.authors, description: submission.reviewRound.associatedAuthors.description, isRequired: true})`; `setCanSubmit(canUserSubmitForm)` where `canUserSubmitForm` needs both `hasFormResponseValue` and `hasFormAuthorsValue`, plus (author) no existing response or (editor) an existing one. `isEditor` is `hasCurrentUserAtLeastOneAssignedRoleInStage(submission, stageId, [SUB_EDITOR, MANAGER, SITE_ADMIN])`, which is why an assigned Funding Coordinator (`ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT`) opens the window with "Save" greyed. Server side `ReviewRoundAuthorResponseCommonValidator::commonRules()` requires `authorResponse` (array) and `associatedAuthorIds` (array) and `commonAfter()` checks every id against the publication's authors (the round's `publicationId`, else the current publication). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Fields rows 6–7): the button greys and enables with the text and the tick in every combination; `author.bea`, assigned on the stage but not a contributor, has no box, while a contributor added on the Contributors list without an account does; one editor box on the seeded journal (one form language).

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — `workflowConfigEditorialOJS.js`, `[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EXTERNAL_REVIEW].getPrimaryItems()`: `FileManager` (revisions), `FileManager` (review files), `ReviewerManager`, `AuthorResponseRequestManager` (props `submission`, `reviewRoundId`, `reviewRound`, `contextMinReviewsPerSubmission`, `stageId`), `DiscussionManager`, unconditionally. `workflowConfigAuthorOJS.js`, same stage: `WorkflowListingEmails`, `ReviewerManager` (when open/completed assignments exist), `FileManager`, `DiscussionManager`, then `AuthorResponseManager` only when `selectedReviewRound?.isAuthorResponseRequested` or `statusId ∈ {REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_ACCEPTED, REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_REVISIONS_REQUESTED}`. Table chrome: `AuthorResponseRequestManager.vue` (`PkpTable` label `submission.reviewRound.authorResponse` "Author Response", description `editor.submission.reviewRound.RequestAuthorResponse.description`); columns from `useReviewRoundAuthorResponseConfig::getColumns()` (`user.role.author` "Author", `editor.submission.reviewRound.responseStatus` "Response Status", and `grid.columns.actions` only when `reviewRound.authorResponse`); rows = participants of the stage whose stage assignment's user group has `roleId === ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` (`AuthorResponseRequestManagerStore::authors`, from `GET submissions/{id}/participants/{stageId}`). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 1): the table sits after "Reviewers" and before "Review Tasks & Discussions" for every editorial role and the Funding Coordinator; the "Actions" header is `<span class="sr-only">` and the column exists only once a response does (two headers before, three after, read again 2026-09-06); the author's card is an `h4` box after the discussions, absent before any request or decision; reached through the workflow menu from another stage the table first shows "No Items" and fills within seconds.

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — `AuthorResponseRequestManagerCellStatus.vue`: `canRequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse` → `editor.submission.reviewRound.authorResponse.readyToInvite` "Ready to invite author" (CSS `capitalize`, so it may render with capitals) over `…editorCanRequest` "Editor can now request the author's response."; else `reviewHasResponse` → `editor.submission.reviewRound.responseWasSubmitted` "A response was submitted by {$userFullName}" (`authorResponse.submittedByUser.fullName`); else `submission.dashboard.view.awaitingReviews` "Awaiting reviews". The cell reads the store, not the row, so every row is identical. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 2): all three cells seen, identical on `author.alex`'s and `author.bea`'s rows; the DOM and accessible name read "Ready to invite author" while the rendered text is "Ready To Invite Author" (tests match the DOM string).

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — `AuthorResponseRequestManagerStore::canRequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse`: `!reviewHasResponse && (passesMinimumReviewsCheck || areAllReviewAssignmentsCompleted)`; `areAllReviewAssignmentsCompleted` = the round's `getActiveReviewAssignments()` (statuses not declined/cancelled) is non-empty and every status is in `CompletedReviewAssignmentStatuses` (`RECEIVED`, `COMPLETE`, `THANKED`, `VIEWED`, `useSubmission.js`); `passesMinimumReviewsCheck` = `checkMinimumConsideredReviews()` with `contextMinReviewsPerSubmission` > 0 and at least that many `ConfirmedReviewAssignmentStatuses` (`COMPLETE` only). `AuthorResponseRequestManagerActionButton.vue` binds `:is-disabled="!store.canRequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse"`; nothing reads `isAuthorResponseRequested` on the editorial side (finding A1). Server twin `PKPReviewController::requestAuthorResponse()`: assignments filtered `filterByIsAccepted(true)`, "completed" = `getDateCompleted() !== null`, minimum = `$context->getNumReviewsPerSubmission()` counting completed (not confirmed) reviews — a looser gate than the screen's, reachable only by a typed page (Rule 4a's refusal text `api.reviewRound.422.reviewAssignments`); an existing response answers 409 `api.409.resourceActionConflict`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 3; Coverage states rows 1–4): a round with no reviewer and a round with one accepted request both read "Awaiting reviews" with the button `disabled`; a completed review beside a declined request is ready (the cancelled twin was not driven, note f-a8); on a scratch journal with `numReviewsPerSubmission: 1` a "Review Submitted" row is not enough and "Complete" (Read Review › "Mark as Complete" › the dialog "Mark this review as complete?") is.

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — Page: `useReviewRoundAuthorResponseConfig::getTopItems()` → `AuthorResponseRequestManagerStore::navigateToRequestAuthorReviewResponsePage()` → `redirectToPage('reviewResponse/requestAuthorResponse', {stageId, reviewRoundId, submissionId, ret: 'dashboard/editorial?…workflowSubmissionId=…'})`. `ReviewResponseHandler::requestAuthorResponse()` renders `lib/pkp/templates/reviewResponse/requestAuthorResponse.tpl` (`<request-review-round-author-response>`, registered in `lib/pkp/js/load.js`) with `RequestReviewResponsePage::getConfig()`: `recipients` = users with an author stage assignment on `stageId`, `canChangeRecipients: false`, `initialTemplateKey: REQUEST_REVIEW_ROUND_AUTHOR_RESPONSE`, `emailTemplates` = that template plus its alternates, `attachers` = `Upload`, `FileStage` (submission files), `ReviewFiles` (this round's assignments), `Library`; breadcrumb `navigation.dashboard`, the truncated title, `editor.submission.reviewRound.requestAuthorResponse` "Request Author Response". `RequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse.vue`: `RequestResponseHeader` (`…requestAuthorResponse`, `…aboutToRequestAuthorReviewResponse`), heading `emails.modifyEmailSharedWithUser` in `class="uppercase"`, the `Composer` with `email.to` "To", `common.addCCBCC`, `email.subject`, `stageParticipants.notify.message` "Message", `common.attachFiles`; buttons `common.cancel` (warnable; `window.location.href = ret`) and `editor.submission.reviewRound.authorReviewResponse.submitRequest` "Submit Request" → `POST reviews/{submissionId}/{reviewRoundId}/authorResponse/requestResponse` with `{bcc, cc, locale, recipients: [], subject, body, attachments}`; on success `openDialog` `…authorReviewResponseRequestSent` / `…RequestSent.description` (`{$submissionTitle}`), `modalStyle: 'success'`, one action `submission.list.viewSubmissionSummary` "View Submission Summary" when `ret` is present (else `submission.list.viewSubmission` "View Submission" with `href: null`, finding A4), `close: () => window.location = ret`. `RequestAuthorResponse` form request: `subject`, `body`, `locale` required strings; `cc`, `bcc`, `attachments` nullable arrays; attachments validated per kind. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 4, 4a; Fields rows 1–5): the page as described, browser title "Journal of Public Knowledge", breadcrumb "Dashboard / Author, {title} / Request Author Response"; an emptied subject or message posts and gets 422, shown as `openDialogNetworkError`'s generic "Error" dialog; the not-ready and holds-a-response refusals are the 422 and 409 dialogs quoted in Rule 4a, and a response on the round answers 409 before the not-ready 422, with or without `ret` (2026-09-06); the sent dialog's "View Submission Summary" is an `<a>` to `ret`, and Escape lands on `ret` too. Not driven: a send with CC, BCC or an attachment filled. Seen once, automation-caveated: "Submit Request" is enabled while "Message" still reads "Loading", and a press then gets the "Error" dialog (a 422 with no email).

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — `PKP\mail\mailables\RequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse` (`REQUEST_REVIEW_ROUND_AUTHOR_RESPONSE`, `GROUP_REVIEW`, from `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR` to `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR`, `Configurable`, `supportsTemplates`): built by `AuthorResponseManager::getMailable()` with `getCompletedReviewAssignments()` (`filterByCompleted(true)` on the round). Template `emails.reviewRound.requestAuthorResponse.subject` / `.body` (`lib/pkp/locale/en/emails.po`): greeting `{$recipientName}`, the "Submit Author Response" anchor on `{$reviewRoundAuthorResponseUrl}`, `<hr>`, "The following comments were received from reviewers." and `{$allReviewerComments}`. `PKP\mail\traits\ReviewerComments::setupReviewerCommentsVariable()`: per assignment `<strong>` = reviewer full name when `getReviewMethod() == SUBMISSION_REVIEW_METHOD_OPEN`, else `submission.comments.importPeerReviews.reviewerLetter` "Reviewer {$reviewerLetter}:" (A, B…), then `submission.recommendation` "Recommendation: {$recommendation}", the `SubmissionComment` rows with `getViewable()` (the "For author and editor" text), then `getReviewFormComments()` for elements with `getIncluded()`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 5; Coverage settings rows 5–6): the block is `<p><strong>Reviewer 1:</strong><br>Recommendation: Revisions Required</p><p>{comment}</p>` (a digit, on the page, in the email and in the author's "Notifications" window; a round with two anonymous reviews showed "Reviewer 1:" and "Reviewer 2:", once with each review first, 2026-09-06); an open review on a scratch journal (`defaultReviewMode: 'open'`) is headed `<strong>Rowan Openreviewer</strong>` with no colon; a review form (`reviewForms: [{elements: [{included: true}, {included: false}]}]`) gives `<p>Is the method sound?</p><p>Sound.</p>` on the page, while in the sent email the question sits outside any `<p>` with the answer as the paragraph under it, and omits the not-included question; no attachments; on OMP the same block reads "Recommendation:" with nothing after it.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `isAuthorResponseRequested` is a review-round setting (`ReviewRoundDAO::getAdditionalFieldNames()`), set true by `PKPReviewController::requestAuthorResponse()` after the send and never cleared; exposed per round by `PKP\submission\maps\Schema::getPropertyReviewRounds()` together with `authorResponse` (`ReviewRoundAuthorResponseResource`). Card `AuthorResponseManager.vue`: heading `submission.reviewRound.authorResponse`, text `editor.submission.reviewRound.responseWasSubmitted` when `reviewRound.authorResponse` else `submission.reviewRound.respondToReviews` "Respond to Reviews", button `…viewSubmittedResponse` "View Submitted Response" / `…authorReviewResponse.submit` "Submit Response". The Request Revisions email: `PKP\mail\mailables\DecisionRequestRevisionsNotifyAuthor` uses `ReviewRoundAuthorResponse::setupReviewAuthorResponseVariable()` and the template `emails.editorDecisionRevisions.body` carries the same "Submit Author Response" anchor. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 6; Coverage states rows 8–9): the card on a requested round, on a `requestRevisions` round without a request, and on an `accept` round without a request, whose "Status" box reads "The submission is currently in the Copyediting stage." for `author.alex` and `manager.maya` alike; after a delete the card reads "Respond to Reviews" again and a second response is accepted; on the `requestRevisions` round with no request, the card was gone once the author uploaded a revision (status "Revisions have been submitted and a decision is needed."), note f-a7.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — `PKP\mail\traits\ReviewRoundAuthorResponse::setupReviewAuthorResponseVariable()`: `{$reviewRoundAuthorResponseUrl}` = `dashboard/mySubmissions?workflowSubmissionId={id}&workflowMenuKey=workflow_{stageId}_{reviewRoundId}&reviewResponseAction=respond`. `AuthorResponseManager.vue` watches `isReady` (round, publication and submission loaded) and, when `queryParamsUrl.reviewResponseAction === 'respond'`, calls `openReviewResponseFormModal()`; `cleanQueryParams()` nulls the parameter on success and on close. The `workflowMenuKey` handling is the dashboard's (`dashboardPageStore.js`). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 7): signed in, the href lands with the window open; "Cancel" drops `reviewResponseAction` from the address and a reload opens the round without the window; signed out, Login shows with `source=` carrying the address and the sign-in lands on the same screen with the window open. Seen once, not re-driven in a fresh session: the href still opened the window after a response existed, in its "cannot be edited" state.

<a id="fn-j"></a>
**j** — `AuthorResponseFormModal.vue`: title `submission.reviewRound.submitYourResponse` when `isAuthor` (`hasCurrentUserAtLeastOneAssignedRoleInStage(…, [ROLE_ID_AUTHOR])`), description `submission.reviewRound.authorResponse.note` (no response) or `…authorCannotEdit` (response exists); submit label `submission.reviewRound.authorReviewResponse.submit` for non-editors, `common.cancel`. Submit `POST reviews/{submissionId}/{reviewRoundId}/authorResponse` → `PKPReviewController::submitAuthorResponse()` (`AuthorResponse::create()` with the current user as `userId`, then `associateAuthorsToResponse()`); `onSuccessFn` triggers `triggerDataChange()` and closes. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 8, 9; Actors rows 3–5): the intro texts verbatim (the same on an open, form-based round); the re-read window's box is still `contenteditable` and the tick can be removed, with "Submit Response" `disabled` throughout and nothing saved on "Cancel"; `author.bea` sees the flipped card with "View Submitted Response" only.

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — `useReviewRoundAuthorResponseConfig::getAuthorItemActions()`: no actions without a response; with one, `common.view` "View" (`responseView`) and `common.delete` "Delete" (`responseDelete`, warnable), each `disabled: submittingUser.id !== authorUser.id`; rendered by `AuthorResponseRequestManagerCellMoreActions.vue` (`DropdownActions` labelled `common.moreActions` "More Actions", ellipsis). Editor window: title `submission.reviewRound.authorResponseToReviews` "Author Response to Reviews", description `submission.reviewRound.authorResponse.noteForEditor` (`{$userFullName}`), submit label `common.save` when `isEditor`; `PUT reviews/{submissionId}/{reviewRoundId}/authorResponse/{responseId}` → `PKPReviewController::editAuthorResponse()` updates `authorResponse` and re-associates the authors; `userId` (the submitter) is untouched, hence the unchanged name. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 10; Actors rows 5–6): "More Actions" on both author rows, "View" and "Delete" `aria-disabled` on the non-submitter's, "Delete" styled `text-negative`; the editor's "Save" greys with the box unticked; the saved text is what the author's window then shows; `assistant.rita` gets the same title and note with a `disabled` "Submit Response" and no "Save".

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — `AuthorResponseRequestManagerStore::responseDelete()`: `openDialog({title: common.delete, message: common.confirmDelete, modalStyle: 'negative', actions: [common.ok (warnable) → DELETE reviews/{id}/{roundId}/authorResponse/{responseId}, common.cancel]})`, then `triggerDataChange()`. `PKPReviewController::deleteAuthorResponse()` deletes by round and response id with no further check; `isAuthorResponseRequested` is not touched, so `AddResponse` accepts a new response afterwards. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 11; Actors row 7): the dialog's "OK" is `text-negative` and precedes "Cancel"; after "OK" the settled read still shows the old cell and the table changes by itself within 15 s (a test polls for "Ready to invite author"); after a reload no row has "…"; the Funding Coordinator's `DELETE` answers 401 and the dialog turns into "Error" / "The current role does not have access to this operation." with the response intact for `manager.maya`.

<a id="fn-m"></a>
**m** — One `AuthorResponse` per round (`AddResponse::passedValidation()` 409 on an existing one; `Schema::getPropertyReviewRounds()` maps `first()` per round). The editorial config pushes `AuthorResponseRequestManager` for whichever round is selected (note c), and `canRequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse` reads that round's assignments, so a past round's button follows Rule 3. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 12; Coverage states row 15): two rounds seeded as `decisions: ['sendExternalReview']` with two `reviewRounds[]` entries (round 1 completed, round 2 accepted): round 1 ready and requested, its response readable under "View" after "Review Round 1" is chosen in the workflow menu, round 2 "Awaiting reviews" with no card for the author; the author's round 1 status box reads "The submission has been advanced to the next round of review."; an accepted submission's Copyediting and Production stages show nothing of the response.

<a id="fn-n"></a>
**n** — Recipients: `RequestReviewResponsePage::getAssignedAuthors()` and `AuthorResponseManager::getAssignedAuthorIds()` both read `StageAssignment` rows with `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` on the review stage. `AuthorResponseManager` uses `PKP\decision\types\traits\NotifyAuthors::sendAuthorEmail()`: `Mail::send()` to those users, then, when `$context->getData('notifyAllAuthors')` (`PKPEmailSetupForm`, label `manager.setup.notifyAllAuthors` "Notify All Authors", options `…allAuthors` / `…assignedAuthors`, schema default true), a `DecisionNotifyOtherAuthors` mailable per publication author with an email not among the assigned authors' addresses, body = that template with `{$messageToSubmittingAuthor}` = the editor's body. "Authors" options: `publication.value.authors` from `GET submissions/{id}/publications/{publicationId}` (the round's `publicationId` or the current one). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 13; Side effects bullet 2; Coverage settings rows 3–4): with `author.bea` assigned, one message with both in the To header and a greeting naming both, in either order across runs; on a scratch journal a contributor added through Publication › Contributors › "Add Contributor" (no account) receives the copy with the request's own subject and the two wrapper sentences quoted in Side effects; the setting lives under "Editorial Decisions" on the Emails tab with the question "Who should receive a notification email when an editorial decision is recorded?", and with the second radio saved the contributor's mailbox stays unchanged on a second send.

<a id="fn-o"></a>
**o** — Address `{journal}/reviewResponse/requestAuthorResponse?stageId=3&reviewRoundId={round}&submissionId={id}[&ret=…]` (`lib/pkp/pages/reviewResponse/index.php`). Roles per note a; a role outside the assignment gets the handler's standard access denial; `ReviewRoundRequiredPolicy` returns 404 for an unknown round, and `requestAuthorResponse()` throws `NotFoundHttpException` when the round's submission is not in the current context. `ret` handling per note f. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 14; Actors row 8): `author.alex`, `reader.rosa`, `reviewer.julia` and `assistant.rita` land on `user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.roleBasedAccessDenied`, and so do an unassigned scratch `sectionEditor` (OJS, OMP) and `guestEditor` (OJS); `reviewRoundId=99999`, or another submission's round id, on `…?message=user.authorization.invalidReviewRound` ("Invalid review round."); `manager.maya` without `ret` gets the page, "Cancel" and Escape go to `reviewResponse/null` ("404 Not Found") and the dialog's `<a class="pkpButton">` has no `href`; each "Submit Request" there sent a real email; the same shape on OMP (`editor.diana`).

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — `NotifyAuthors::sendAuthorEmail()` logs the mailable with `Repo::emailLogEntry()->logMailable(SubmissionEmailLogEventType::EDITOR_NOTIFY_AUTHOR, …)`, the event type `WorkflowListingEmails.vue` lists (review stage spec note k). No `Notification`, no `EventLog` row and no mailable is created by `submitAuthorResponse()`, `editAuthorResponse()` or `deleteAuthorResponse()`, and none by `requestAuthorResponse()` beyond the email log (grep of `lib/pkp/classes/notification`, `classes/log`, `classes/observers` for `authorResponse`: nothing). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Side effects bullets 1, 4, 5; A1, A2): the author's "Notifications" list holds one `listitem` per send, each opening the "Notifications" window with the email and its link; "Activity Log & Notes" › History gains "An email has been sent: Request For Author Response To Reviewer Feedback" per send and nothing for the submit, edit, delete or re-submit; "Tasks" reads "No Items" and the dashboard row is unchanged for `editor.diana`; Mailpit counts for `editor.diana` and `sectioneditor.ana` on the title stayed 0 through every author action.

<a id="fn-q"></a>
**q** — `AuthorResponse::isPublic()`: true when the round's non-declined, non-cancelled `review_assignments` rows all have `is_review_publicly_visible` set; surfaced in `ReviewRoundAuthorResponseResource` as `isPublic` and consumed by `lib/ui-library/src/frontend/components/PkpOpenReview/PkpOpenReviewAuthorResponseContent.vue`. `AuthorResponse` also carries a `doiId` whose settings form fields are commented out in `ojs classes/components/forms/context/DoiSetupSettingsForm.php` ("Functionality for author response DOIs exists but is not currently supported"), so no screen sets it. Not probed: no screen in this feature shows either.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Scenario tooling. Ready accounts: `editor.diana` (Editor; manager level), `manager.maya` (Journal Manager), `sectioneditor.ana` (Section Editor of "Articles"), `assistant.rita` (Funding Coordinator, review-stage access), `reviewer.julia` and `reviewer.paul` (Reviewers), `author.alex` (submitter) and `author.bea` (co-author with an account, never a contributor); passwords per `docs/process/users.md`. A submission in review: `POST scenarios/submission` `{submitter: 'author.alex', decisions: ['sendExternalReview'], reviewRounds: [{reviewers: [{username: 'reviewer.julia', status: 'accepted'}]}], participants: [{username: 'sectioneditor.ana', role: 'sectionEditor'}]}`. A review that is in: `status: 'completed'`, with the optional `recommendation` (OJS only: `accept` by default, `pendingRevisions` = "Revisions Required") and `comments` (the "For author and editor" text; default "Seeded review comments for {tag}."); the seed runs the reviewer wizard's own steps, so the app's "Review complete…" and "Thank you for your submission…" emails go out and a mailbox count is matched by the submission title. The round id for a typed address comes from the seed response (`reviewRounds[].id`). Scenario 1: two submissions, one `accepted`, one `completed` with `recommendation: 'pendingRevisions', comments: 'The method needs a control group.'`; the seeded journal's review mode is anonymous, so the email's heading reads "Reviewer 1:"; a test waits for the composer (the iframe present and "Loading" gone) before "Submit Request", and reads the sent email by the submission title in `author.alex`'s mailbox. Scenario 2: scenario 1's ready submission after one request; the signed-out click on the email's button is a fresh browser context opening the href; `editor.diana`'s mailbox is counted by the submission title before and after. Scenario 3: scenario 2's state (the request sent and `author.alex`'s response submitted through the window); after "Delete" › "OK" a test polls the table for "Ready to invite author" (note l). Scenario 4: `decisions: ['sendExternalReview', 'requestRevisions']` with the reviewer `completed` and `{username: 'author.bea', role: 'author'}` in `participants`; the seeded decision sends no email, so the scenario opens the round from My Submissions; the co-author is a stage assignment, not a contributor, so the "Authors" boxes show one name. Scenario 5: `POST scenarios/context` with `review: {numReviewsPerSubmission: 1}` and `users[]` holding a `manager`, two `externalReviewer`s and an `author`, then a submission with the first reviewer `completed` (`recommendation: 'pendingRevisions', comments: 'Shorten the introduction.'`) and the second `accepted`; a roster reviewer named on a scratch context is assigned but not enrolled (seed-facts 2026-09-05), hence the throwaway reviewers. Scenario 6: scenario 1's ready shape (section "Articles", `sectioneditor.ana` assigned) plus `{username: 'assistant.rita', role: 'funding'}` in `participants`; the wrong-round address uses `reviewRoundId=99999`; the Journal Manager's real-round address is opened without `ret`, hence the A4 aside. Scenario 7: OMP `decisions: ['sendExternalReview']` with `reviewRounds: [{stage: 'external', reviewers: [{username: 'reviewer.julia', status: 'completed'}]}]` (no `recommendation` on a press) and the Request Revisions decision recorded by `editor.diana` through the wizard ("Require New Review Round" › "Next", "Notify Authors", "Notify Reviewers", "Record Decision"), which sends the decision email the scenario reads; OPS a plain submitted preprint (OPS refuses `reviewRounds`), with `manager.maya` as Preprint Server Manager, `sectioneditor.ana` as Moderator and `author.alex` as its Author, the address typed with `stageId=3&reviewRoundId=1`. Emails are read in Mailpit by recipient address (PRINCIPLES A8; the roster mailboxes are shared, so a test matches the submission title in the subject line's body or uses a throwaway author). The request page's address: `…/reviewResponse/requestAuthorResponse?stageId=3&reviewRoundId={id}&submissionId={id}` (on a press `stageId=3` is External Review).

<a id="fn-f-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — Note e: neither `AuthorResponseRequestManagerCellStatus.vue` nor `canRequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse` reads `isAuthorResponseRequested`, and `PKPReviewController::requestAuthorResponse()` refuses only when a response exists, so a second `POST …/requestResponse` sends a second email and sets the flag again. The author's config (note c) does read the flag. Live-probed 2026-09-06: three sends on one round, each `POST …/requestResponse` 200, three Mailpit messages, three "Notifications" rows and three "An email has been sent" log rows, the table unchanged throughout.

<a id="fn-f-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — Note p: `submitAuthorResponse()` creates the row and returns the resource; no `Notification`, `EventLog` or mailable. Compare `PendingRevisionsNotificationManager` for uploaded revisions and the discussion reply notifications, both of which raise a task or email. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note p): nothing for the editor after a submit, an edit, a delete and a second submit.

<a id="fn-f-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — Notes a, c, k: the editorial config pushes the table for every editorial-view user; the button's `is-disabled` and the row actions' `disabled` depend on readiness and on the submitting user only, never on the viewer's role, while `ReviewResponseHandler` assigns the page to manager, admin and sub-editor and the DELETE route to the same three. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (notes a, k, l): the button leads to `user/authorizationDenied`, the window shows "Submit Response" `disabled` (`isEditor` false for `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT`), and the `DELETE` answers 401 with the "Error" dialog.

<a id="fn-f-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — Note f: `getReturnUrlToSubmissionSummary()` returns `null` without `ret`; `cancelResponseRequest()` sets `window.location.href = null` and the dialog's action gets `href: null` with the label `submission.list.viewSubmission`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note o): `reviewResponse/null` renders "404 Not Found"; the dialog's anchor has no `href` and a press on it changes nothing; the same on OMP.

<a id="fn-f-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — Note f: `RequestAuthorResponse` refuses a missing `subject` or `body` with 422, and `RequestReviewRoundAuthorResponse.vue` routes every non-2xx answer of "Submit Request" to `openDialogNetworkError` (the generic "Error" dialog) instead of `setErrors` on the composer, so the field-level message never shows. Live-probed 2026-09-06: two 422s, the same dialog both times, the page's content intact after "OK".

<a id="fn-f-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — Note g: `emails.reviewRound.requestAuthorResponse.body` opens with a fixed sentence ("All peer reviews for your submission titled "{$submissionTitle}" have now been completed.") and `getCompletedReviewAssignments()` quotes only the reviews with a `dateCompleted`, so the minimum branch of note e sends the sentence with one block. Live-probed 2026-09-06 on a scratch journal with `numReviewsPerSubmission: 1`, the second reviewer "Request Accepted".

<a id="fn-f-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — Note c: the author's config shows the card only for `isAuthorResponseRequested` or a round in `REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_REVISIONS_REQUESTED` / `REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_ACCEPTED`; an uploaded revision moves the round to `REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_REVISIONS_SUBMITTED` (`editor.submission.roundStatus.revisionsSubmitted`), and the Request Revisions decision sets no request flag, so the card goes and the email's `reviewResponseAction=respond` finds no card to open. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (OJS, `author.alex` on a `requestRevisions` round without a request): the card present after the decision (status "Revisions have been requested."); after the author's upload under "Revisions Uploaded", the status "Revisions have been submitted and a decision is needed." and no card; the decision email's href, still carrying `reviewResponseAction=respond`, landed with no card and no window; the editor's table read "Ready to invite author" with "Request Response" enabled.

<a id="fn-f-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — Note e: `getActiveReviewAssignments()` drops declined and cancelled assignments alike, and `ReviewerComments::setupReviewerCommentsVariable()` iterates the completed assignments only, so a cancelled request should count like a declined one on both the cell and the email. Not driven: the scenario API seeds no `cancelled` reviewer status. The settling read: on a round with one completed review and one accepted request, the editor takes the accepted reviewer's "…" › "Cancel Reviewer", then reads the cell (expected "Ready to invite author", "Request Response" enabled) and opens the request page (expected one reviewer block).

<a id="fn-f-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — Note a for the missing components; note h for the shared `DecisionRequestRevisionsNotifyAuthor` and template. Seen 2026-07-31 on a press during the review-stage probes (recorded in the review stage spec's note a: no Author Response panel in either view, console clean, while the author still received the letter inviting a response). Re-observed 2026-09-06 on the current build: no table on `workflow_3_{round}` or `workflow_2_{round}`; the typed page renders, `POST …/requestResponse` 200, the email's anchor `…mySubmissions?workflowSubmissionId={id}&workflowMenuKey=workflow_3_{round}&reviewResponseAction=respond`; the Request Revisions wizard's "Notify Authors" message and the "Your submission has been reviewed and we encourage you to submit revisions" email carry the same anchor; the author lands on External Review with the headings "Round 1 Status", "Notifications", "Revisions Uploaded", "Review Tasks & Discussions", no "Author Response" and no window, console clean (own console listeners; the kit's `screen()` does not capture it).
