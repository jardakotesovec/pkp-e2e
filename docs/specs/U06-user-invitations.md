# User invitations

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

Journal teams grow by invitation. A manager picks a person, either someone
already registered or a complete outsider, names the roles they should hold
(with a start date, an optional end date, and whether they appear on the
journal's public masthead), and sends them an email invitation. The recipient
follows the emailed link to accept or decline. A new person creates an
account on the spot; an existing user has the roles linked to their account.
Until the recipient answers, the manager can watch, edit, or cancel the
pending invitation from the same screen where users are managed. Invitations
expire on their own after a few days, so a stale link never grants a role.

## Actors & permissions

"The recipient" below means whoever holds the emailed invitation link. Every
sending capability lives on the **Users & Roles** screen (Users tab). Who can
reach that screen at all belongs to the user-management feature (see
*Cross-feature interactions*).

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **See pending invitations** | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager: the "Invitations" table on Users & Roles <sup>a</sup> |
| **Invite to a role** (open the send wizard) | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager: the "Invite to a role" button <sup>a</sup><br>• ⚠ [A1](#a1) No other role is offered the button. An Author or Reviewer who types the wizard's own address (the URL a manager reaches via "Invite to a role") is turned away. Who else the address lets through is an open question <sup>b</sup> |
| **Edit a pending invitation** | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager: "Edit Invitation" on the invitation's row (Rule 12) <sup>a</sup> |
| **Cancel a pending invitation** | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager: "Cancel Invite" on the invitation's row <sup>a</sup> |
| **Propose roles for an existing member** | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager: the user row's Edit action opens the same wizard (Rule 13) <sup>c</sup> |
| **Accept or decline** | • The recipient: via the emailed links, while the invitation is pending. This works signed out, and no credentials are asked (Rules 6–7) <sup>f</sup> |
| **Customize the invitation email for one send** | • Whoever is sending: the wizard's compose step (subject, body, template choice) <sup>g</sup> |
| **Edit the stored invitation email template** | • Journal Manager: on the Emails settings screen, which belongs to the emails-management feature. ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1) On a preprint server the template has no row there <sup>j</sup> |

## Fields & validation

On a press the "Journal Masthead" column reads "Press Masthead", and on a
preprint server "Server Masthead". Button labels containing "OJS" carry the
app's own acronym: a press shows "Create OMP account" and "Accept And
Continue to OMP", a preprint server "Accept And Continue to OPS".

Send wizard. The fields below are for a **new** invitee. For an existing
user the personal fields show read-only.

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Search for a user by email address, username, or ORCID iD" | yes (to pass step 1) | Exact match on email, then username, then ORCID iD. A miss, even text that is no valid email address, advances to "Enter details" with "The user does not have a role in this journal". The typed text is discarded (the Email field arrives empty) and the address is validated there instead <sup>h</sup> |
| Email / Given Name / Family Name / Affiliation | email only | Names are optional; helper text notes the invitee can change them. A name is entered in the journal's primary language. If the address gains an account before the invitation is accepted, what the recipient then sees was not verified live <sup>o</sup> |
| Role (per row, "Select a new role") | at least one row | Roles the person already holds, or already chosen in another row, are not offered. From the second row on, a row's fields lose their screen-reader names ⚠ [A8](#a8) <sup>i</sup> |
| Start Date (per role row) | yes | A date in the past takes effect as "today" at acceptance (Rule 8) ⚠ [A8](#a8) |
| End Date (per role row) | no | Cannot be entered when inviting. An added role row's END DATE cell shows "---" and holds no input. The column only displays dates on an existing member's current roles (Rule 13) <sup>i</sup> |
| Journal Masthead (per role row) | yes | The select starts blank ("Appear on the masthead" / "Does not appear on the masthead"). Leaving it empty blocks the step with "This field is required." Choosing Reviewer replaces the select with the fixed text "Appear on the masthead", so there is no choice to make ⚠ [A8](#a8) <sup>i</sup> |
| Email subject & body (compose step) | prefilled | Freely editable for this send. A different stored template can be selected <sup>g</sup> |

Accept wizard (new invitee):

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Username | yes | Must not be taken <sup>o</sup> |
| Password | yes | At least six characters, the minimum the field states on screen <sup>o</sup> |
| Privacy consent ("Yes, I agree to have my data collected…") | yes | Unchecked blocks the step with "Please confirm that you have read and agree privacy statement". The label links to the journal's Privacy Statement <sup>o</sup> |
| Given Name / Family Name / Country / Affiliation | given name, country | Collected on the "Enter details" step. Editable again from the review step via its Edit button <sup>k</sup> |

## Rules & state

<a id="invitation-states"></a>
1. An invitation is either **being composed** (started in the wizard, not yet
   sent), **pending** (sent, awaiting the recipient's answer), or settled as
   **accepted**, **declined**, or **cancelled**. There is no separate "expired"
   state. A pending invitation past its deadline simply stops working (Rule 4)
   and is later purged (see *Side effects*). <sup>d</sup>
2. Sending sets the acceptance deadline. The recipient has a fixed number of
   days to answer: 3, unless the site is configured otherwise (see
   *Settings*). <sup>e</sup>
3. One live invitation per person per journal. Sending a new role invitation
   to the same person (or email address) silently replaces any earlier pending
   one. The second send's wizard gives no hint that a pending invitation
   exists. Afterwards the Invitations table holds only the newer row, and the
   older email's links stop working ⚠ [A3](#a3). <sup>d</sup>
4. <a id="invitation-landing"></a> **The invitation-link landing.** Every
   invitation email carries personal accept and decline links. A link whose
   invitation is still pending opens its flow (for role invitations, Rules
   5–7; other invitation kinds land in their own features' flows, see
   *Cross-feature interactions*). A correct link whose invitation was already
   answered (accepted or declined), cancelled, or expired shows the
   "Invitation Unavailable" page. It reads "This invitation is no longer
   available. It may have already been accepted, declined, or expired…" and
   offers "Login" and "Register" buttons. A tampered or truncated link shows a
   not-found error. ⚠ [A3](#a3) The links of a replaced invitation, whether
   edited or superseded by a new send to the same person, also show the bare
   not-found error. <sup>f</sup>
5. The accept wizard shapes itself to the recipient. A **new** invitee walks
   up to four steps: "Verify ORCID iD" → "Create OJS account" → "Enter
   details" → "Review & create account". An **existing** user gets at most
   "Verify ORCID iD" plus the review step. The ORCID step appears only when
   ORCID is enabled for the journal and the recipient has no verified ORCID
   iD. The review step is always there. Opening the link alone never accepts
   the roles; the recipient always presses the accept button. <sup>k</sup>
6. The recipient works signed out. The emailed link is the only credential the
   accept wizard asks for. An existing user gets no password prompt and no
   account fields. The link never signs anyone in either (Rule 9). If somebody
   else is already signed in on that browser, the page refuses with
   "Invitation not accepted. You're logged in as a different user." and a
   "Logout" action that genuinely ends that session. <sup>l</sup>
7. On the ORCID step the recipient either verifies their iD through the ORCID
   sign-in window ("Verify ORCID iD") or passes with "Skip ORCID
   verification". This step has no other Continue button. <sup>k</sup>
8. Accepting grants every listed role from its start date, with the chosen
   masthead visibility, and marks the invitation accepted. A past start date
   takes effect as the acceptance day. The final button reads "Accept And
   Continue to OJS". A closing dialog announces the new role, and its "View
   All Submissions" button leads out of the wizard (Rule 9). <sup>m</sup>
9. A new invitee's account exists only from the moment they accept. They
   choose a username and password mid-wizard. ⚠ [A4](#a4) Accepting signs
   nobody in. New invitees and existing users alike leave the closing dialog
   for the sign-in screen and must sign in themselves. <sup>m</sup>
10. Declining is deliberate. The emailed decline link opens a "Decline
    Invitation" confirmation page, and only pressing "Confirm Decline
    Invitation" declines. No roles are granted, and the browser moves to the
    sign-in page. Afterwards both emailed links show the "Invitation
    Unavailable" page (Rule 4). <sup>n</sup>
11. The "Invitations" table lists only invitations still awaiting an answer.
    Each row reads "Invited {date}". Answered, cancelled, replaced, and
    expired invitations leave the list. <sup>p</sup>
12. **Editing means replacing.** "Edit Invitation" warns "If you edit the
    existing invitation or add a new role, the current invitation will be
    canceled and, a new one will be sent." The wizard reopens prefilled.
    Sending composes a fresh invitation whose email supersedes the old one,
    and the old links stop working ⚠ [A3](#a3). <sup>q</sup>
13. The user row's Edit action opens the same wizard for an existing member,
    with no search step. Inside its roles table, **removing** a current role
    or changing its masthead visibility takes effect at once, each behind its
    own confirmation, and the member is emailed either way (see *Side
    effects*) ⚠ [OMP1](#omp1). A removed role stays listed: its row keeps its
    place in the roles table with End Date set to today and "User Removed
    From Role" where its Remove Role button was. **Adding** a role is only a
    proposal. It takes effect when the member accepts the resulting
    invitation. A member's last active role cannot be removed. Pressing its
    Remove Role opens no confirmation: a "Remove Role" dialog answers "You
    cannot remove the role. At least one role must be assigned to the user."
    with a single "Close" button, and the role keeps its Remove Role button
    and masthead select. In this wizard "Save And Continue" on the details
    step stays inactive while no new role row exists. An empty row is enough
    to activate it; pressing it rejects the missing role fields with inline
    errors. <sup>c</sup> <sup>i</sup>
14. A disabled user cannot be invited. Reaching one through the search step
    shows "The user is currently disabled." with instructions to enable them
    first, and no role row can be added. Reaching the same person through the
    users list's Edit action shows the same warning above their details and
    current roles. On both paths "Add Another Role" and "Save And Continue"
    are shown but inactive. ⚠ [A9](#a9) Both paths list the person's current
    roles, and each still keeps an active masthead select and an active
    "Remove Role". Pressed through the Edit action, both act at once as in
    Rule 13, with the email to the disabled user; on the search path they
    were seen active and were not pressed. <sup>i</sup>
15. Wizard navigation (send side). "Back" returns one step, and returning to
    the search step clears everything entered. "Cancel" asks for confirmation
    only when something was changed. The final button reads "Invite user to
    the role", and a success dialog ("Invitation Sent") confirms. ⚠ [A5](#a5)
    That dialog promises updates about the recipient's decision. Its only
    button, "View All Users", returns the browser to Users & Roles. <sup>g</sup>
16. Cancelling a pending invitation (from its row, behind a confirmation
    listing the invitee's details) deactivates the emailed links immediately.
    The recipient then sees the "Invitation Unavailable" page (Rule 4). <sup>q</sup>

## Side effects

- **On send**: one invitation email to the recipient, from the inviter. It
  lists the roles offered (with dates and masthead visibility), the roles
  they already hold, and the accept and decline links. Subject and body are
  whatever the compose step showed at send time. ⚠ [A7](#a7) The email's
  fixed copy carries small wording slips. It greets a new invitee by their
  email address even when a name was entered. <sup>j</sup>
- **On acceptance**: the account is created (new invitee) or the roles are
  added to the existing account. Masthead listings update per the chosen
  visibility.
- **On role removal or masthead change** (the user-row wizard, Rule 13): the
  member is emailed at once ("You have been removed from a role" / "Your
  journal masthead visibility has been updated"). Only the masthead
  confirmation says so up front ("The user will be notified of this
  change."); the removal confirmation warns of the lost access and
  permissions and says nothing of an email. ⚠ [OMP1](#omp1) On a press or
  preprint server the masthead email fails with a raw error shown to the
  manager, though the visibility change itself sticks. A disabled member is
  emailed the same way ⚠ [A9](#a9). <sup>r</sup>
- **No notice to the inviter**: nobody is emailed or notified when the
  recipient accepts or declines ⚠ [A5](#a5). The pending row simply
  disappears. From the manager's screens, an acceptance and a decline can be
  told apart only by the new name an acceptance adds under Current
  Users. <sup>m</sup>
- **Daily cleanup**: a scheduled task permanently removes expired invitations
  once a day. ⚠ [A2](#a2) It also removes invitations still being composed,
  which never got a deadline. <sup>e</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

- **Invitation lifetime**: how many days the recipient has to answer (default
  3) is set in the installation's configuration file. There is no screen for
  it, so changing it is the system administrator's job. The value in force at
  the moment of sending applies. <sup>e</sup>
- **ORCID**: the "Verify ORCID iD" step exists only when ORCID is enabled for
  the journal (Rule 5). <sup>k</sup>
- **Site minimum password length**: the accept wizard's password field
  enforces it and states it (six characters on a default install). <sup>o</sup>
- **Privacy Statement**: the consent checkbox links to the journal's Privacy
  Statement page. <sup>o</sup>
- **Invitation email template**: the stored template used to prefill the
  compose step is editable on the Emails settings screen. ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1) On
  a preprint server it has no row there, though sending still works. <sup>j</sup>

## Cross-feature interactions

- **Users & Roles screen**: the Invitations table and the "Invite to a role"
  button live on the Users tab, above the users list. Who reaches that
  screen, and everything else about managing existing users, belongs to the
  user-management feature (spec to come, *User management*).
- **Invitation-link landing**: Rule 4 is the shared front door for every
  emailed invitation link. The reviewer one-click review link (see the future
  *Review assignments* spec) and the registration email-validation and
  profile-email-change confirmations all land through it. Each flow's own
  behavior belongs to its feature. <sup>f</sup>
- **Emails management**: the stored invitation email template is edited on
  the Emails settings screen (future *Emails management* spec). This spec
  owns only the invitation-specific defect ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1).
- **Roles settings**: which roles exist to be offered, their levels, and the
  masthead concept belong to the roles-configuration feature. This wizard
  only uses them.

## Canonical scenarios

Every scenario but 9 runs on a scratch journal of its own, with a throwaway
Journal Manager, throwaway invitee addresses and the emails read in the
mail catcher; scenarios 3, 7, 8 and 10 start with an extra throwaway user
(scenario 7 with two), scenario 10's journal has ORCID enabled and its
extra user holds a verified ORCID iD, and scenario 9 browses the seeded
preprint server as its ready Preprint Server Manager. The accounts, the
addresses and the tooling recipe are in the footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **Invite a newcomer to a role**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal. <sup>s</sup>

   - **Users & Roles**: press "Invite to a role".
   - **"Search User"**: enter an email address no account uses (the footnote
     names it) and continue: the wizard answers "The user does not have a
     role in this journal" and moves to "Enter details".
   - **"Enter details"**: fill in Given Name Nova and add a role row: pick
     the offered role (the footnote names it per app), set Start Date to
     today, and choose "Appear on the masthead" in the masthead select,
     which starts blank. (If you choose Reviewer instead, that text shows
     fixed, with nothing to select.) Continue to the compose step.
   - **The compose step**: replace the subject with a marker of this run
     (the footnote names it) and press "Invite user to the role": an
     "Invitation Sent" dialog appears.
   - **"View All Users"**: press it: the browser returns to Users & Roles,
     where the Invitations table shows the row as "Invited {date}".
   - **The recipient's mailbox**: holds the invitation email, sent from the
     Journal Manager, listing the offered role with its start date and
     masthead visibility and the accept and decline links (Side effects).
   - **The email's subject and body**: the subject is the marker typed on
     the compose step and the body the text that step showed at send time
     (Side effects).
   - **A second send to the same address**: press "Invite to a role" again,
     search the same address and walk the wizard the same way to "Invite
     user to the role": the wizard gives no hint that a pending invitation
     exists, and afterwards the Invitations table holds only the newer row
     (Rule 3).
   - **Control**: under Current Users the address has no row: a new
     invitee's account exists only from the moment they accept (Rule 9).

2. **Newcomer accepts and gets an account**

   Given: a signed-out visitor holding the accept link of a pending
   invitation to a throwaway address, sent as in scenario 1 on a scratch
   journal with ORCID off. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The accept link**: open it: the wizard opens on "Create OJS account"
     with no "Verify ORCID iD" step, ORCID being off on this journal
     (Rule 5).
   - **The password's minimum on "Create OJS account"**: the Password field
     states its minimum, six characters on a default install; Pass5, five
     characters, is refused and the step does not advance (Settings).
   - **"Create OJS account"**: choose a username and password (the footnote
     names them) and tick the privacy consent.
   - **The consent checkbox's label**: links to the journal's Privacy
     Statement page (Settings).
   - **"Enter details"**: fill in Given Name Nova and Country Canada.
   - **"Review & create account"**: check the summary; its Edit button
     reopens the details. Press "Accept And Continue to OJS": a dialog
     announces the new role.
   - **"View All Submissions"**: ⚠ [A4](#a4) the dialog's "View All
     Submissions" button lands on the sign-in screen.
   - **The sign-in screen**: signing in with the new credentials succeeds,
     and the account holds the offered role.
   - **Control**: the invitation's row is gone from the manager's
     Invitations table, beside the account now holding the role (Rule 11).

3. **Existing user accepts an additional role**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with a
   throwaway user who holds the Author role and not the offered one, the
   user signed out. <sup>s</sup>

   - **"Search User"**: press "Invite to a role" on Users & Roles and search
     the user's exact email address: the wizard confirms the user exists and
     shows their details read-only.
   - **"Enter details" and the compose step**: add one new role row (the
     offered role, Start Date today, "Appear on the masthead") and send.
   - **The recipient's mailbox**: holds the invitation email listing the
     offered role and, as a role already held, Author (Side effects).
   - **The accept link**: signed out, open it: the review step opens
     directly (at most an ORCID step precedes it), with no password prompt
     and no account fields.
   - **The link opened, the accept button not pressed**: on the manager's
     Users & Roles the row still reads "Invited {date}": opening the link
     alone never accepts the roles (Rule 5).
   - **"Accept And Continue to OJS"**: press it. ⚠ [A4](#a4) The browser
     lands on the sign-in screen still signed out.
   - **The sign-in screen**: signing in the usual way shows the role on the
     account, and the manager sees the name under Current Users.
   - **Control**: the invitation's row is gone from the Invitations table
     (Rule 11), where it still stood before the accept button was pressed.

4. **Recipient declines**

   Given: the recipient of a pending invitation to a throwaway address,
   sent as in scenario 1, signed out, holding the emailed links. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The decline link**: open it: a "Decline Invitation" page asks for
     confirmation.
   - **The page open, not yet confirmed**: on the manager's Users & Roles
     the row still reads "Invited {date}": opening the decline link alone
     declines nothing (Rule 10).
   - **"Confirm Decline Invitation"**: press it: the browser lands on the
     sign-in page, no role was granted, and the invitation's row is gone
     from the Invitations table.
   - **Control**: both emailed links now show "Invitation Unavailable"
     (Rule 4).

5. **Manager cancels a pending invitation**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with a pending
   invitation to a throwaway address, sent as in scenario 1, its email in
   the recipient's mailbox. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The invitation's row menu**: choose "Cancel Invite": the confirmation
     dialog recaps the invitee (email, role, status, affiliation).
   - **Confirm**: the row disappears.
   - **The recipient's accept link**: now shows "Invitation Unavailable"
     with Login and Register buttons.
   - **Control**: the same accept link with its end cut off shows a
     not-found error instead, never the "Invitation Unavailable" page
     (Rule 4).

6. **Manager edits a pending invitation**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with a pending
   invitation to a throwaway address, sent as in scenario 1, its email in
   the recipient's mailbox. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The invitation's row menu**: choose Edit: a dialog warns the current
     invitation will be canceled and a new one sent. Proceed.
   - **The wizard**: opens prefilled without the search step. Change the
     role set (the footnote names the roles), replace the subject with a
     second marker of this run and send.
   - **The recipient's mailbox**: holds a second invitation email.
   - **Control**: the second email's links work, its accept link opening
     the accept wizard, while the first email's links no longer do
     ⚠ [A3](#a3).

7. **Wrong person signed in**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with two
   throwaway users: a member holding the Author role, and a bystander,
   signed in in a browser of their own. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The member's invitation**: invite the member to a further role as in
     scenario 3: their mailbox holds the accept link.
   - **The accept link in the bystander's browser**: open it: the page
     refuses with "Invitation not accepted. You're logged in as a different
     user." and offers to log out.
   - **Control**: press "Logout", which ends that session, and reopen the
     link: the real flow starts (Rule 6).

8. **Propose a role via the user row**

   Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with a
   throwaway member holding two roles, Author and Reader. <sup>s</sup>

   - **Edit on the member's row in the users list**: press it: the wizard
     opens on their details with no search step. The roles table shows the
     current roles with Remove Role and masthead controls. These act
     immediately and email the member.
   - **The masthead control on the Author row**: pick the other of "Appear
     on the masthead" and "Does not appear on the masthead": the
     confirmation dialog says "The user will be notified of this change.";
     confirm: the change takes effect at once, and on a journal the member's
     mailbox holds "Your journal masthead visibility has been updated"
     (Rule 13, Side effects). ⚠ [OMP1](#omp1) On a press or preprint server the
     masthead confirmation shows an error, though the change sticks.
   - **Remove Role on the Reader row**: press it: the confirmation asks "Are
     you sure you want to remove this role? The user will lose access and
     permissions associated with it." and says nothing of an email; confirm
     with "Remove Role": the row stays in the roles table with its End Date
     set to today and "User Removed From Role" in place of its button, and
     the member's mailbox holds "You have been removed from a role" (Rule 13,
     Side effects).
   - **Remove Role on the Author row, now the last active role**: press it:
     no confirmation opens; a "Remove Role" dialog answers "You cannot remove
     the role. At least one role must be assigned to the user." with a
     single "Close" button. Press "Close": the row keeps its Remove Role
     button and masthead select (Rule 13).
   - **"Save And Continue" on the details step**: stays inactive until a new
     role row is added.
   - **An empty role row**: add a role row and leave it empty: "Save And
     Continue" activates; press it: the missing role fields are rejected
     with inline errors (Rule 13).
   - **The filled row**: fill it in (the offered role, Start Date today,
     "Appear on the masthead") and send: the member receives an invitation
     email.
   - **Control**: the role appears on the member's account only after they
     accept it (scenario 3's flow), while the removal and the masthead
     change above took effect at once (Rule 13).

App-specific:

9. **The invitation template is missing from the Emails screen** {OPS}

   Given: a Preprint Server Manager, signed in, on the seeded preprint
   server. <sup>s</sup>

   - **The Emails settings screen**: open it and search for "User Invited to
     Role Notification": the list answers "No items found."
     ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1)
   - **Control**: scenario 1, run on the same install, still delivers the
     invitation email; on a journal or press the same search finds the
     template with an Edit button.

10. **The ORCID step, shown only to a recipient without a verified iD** {OJS OMP OPS}

    Given: a Journal Manager, signed in, on a scratch journal with ORCID
    enabled, with a throwaway user who holds the Author role and a verified
    ORCID iD (seeded), the user signed out. <sup>s</sup>

    - **A newcomer's invitation**: invite an email address no account uses
      (the footnote names it) as in scenario 1: its mailbox holds the accept
      link.
    - **The newcomer's accept link**: signed out, open it: the wizard opens
      on "Verify ORCID iD", which offers the "Verify ORCID iD" button and
      "Skip ORCID verification" and no other Continue button (Rules 5, 7).
      Leave "Verify ORCID iD" unpressed.
    - **"Skip ORCID verification"**: press it: "Create OJS account" opens
      (Rule 5).
    - **The verified user's invitation**: invite the throwaway user to a
      further role as in scenario 3: their mailbox holds the accept link.
    - **Control**: that accept link, opened signed out, opens the review
      step directly with no "Verify ORCID iD" step: the step shows only to a
      recipient without a verified ORCID iD (Rule 5).

## Coverage

Left out of the scenarios above, by reason:

- **Budget** — states:
  - a disabled user met on the search step and through the users list's Edit
    action, "The user is currently disabled." and the two inactive buttons
    on both (Rule 14): a manager rarely sets out to invite a person they

  - a past start date taking effect as the acceptance day (Rule 8): a
    manager rarely backdates a start date, and the body names no screen
    where a role's start date is read back after acceptance
- **Budget** — variants:
  - the template choice on the compose step (Actors row 7): the body states

    lands
- **Nothing new to test**:
  - a Site Administrator sending, editing, cancelling or proposing (Actors

### All apps

<a id="a1"></a>
**A1 — Wizard address wider than its screen** · ❓ · latent.
The only screen offering "Invite to a role" is Users & Roles (Managers and the
Site Administrator), but in code the wizard's own address is gated more
widely. An Author or Reviewer who types the address is turned away. The live
outcome for the remaining roles was checked on 2026-07-31 and is recorded in
the maintainer's private security file, not here.
Question: should anyone beyond Managers and the Site Administrator reach the
send wizard at all? Lean: no. The screen's narrower gate looks like the
product decision.
Basis: code + probe. <sup>[f-a1](#fn-a1)</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — Cleanup eats unsent drafts** · ❓ · latent.
The daily cleanup that purges expired invitations also deletes every
invitation still being composed, because drafts never carry a deadline. A
manager who happens to be mid-wizard when the daily run fires loses the draft,
and the wizard's next step fails. Such drafts pile up routinely: one pass
through the edit wizard left three behind, invisible anywhere in the UI.
Question: is same-day draft deletion intended housekeeping?
Lean: the cleanup is intended, and the mid-wizard window is an accepted-loss
edge case.
Basis: judgment (code); drafts observed live, the cleanup run itself not. <sup>[f-a2](#fn-a2)</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — Replaced invitation's links die ungracefully** · 🐞 · minor.
A cancelled, declined, or expired invitation's old links show the friendly
"Invitation Unavailable" page. A replaced invitation, whether replaced through
Edit or superseded by a plain new send to the same person, is erased outright.
Its old email links therefore render a bare "404 Not Found" with no journal
styling. This is the one stale-link case that skips the explanation. The
user's situation is the same as after a cancellation, so it should get the
same page.
Basis: probe + claim check. <sup>[f-a3](#fn-a3)</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — Nobody is signed in after accepting** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A newcomer who has just chosen a username and password and pressed "Accept And
Continue to OJS" is not inside. The closing dialog's "View All Submissions"
button lands on the sign-in screen, and they must type the credentials again.
An existing user, whose link opened the wizard with no password prompt, ends
on the same sign-in screen. The roles themselves are granted correctly.
Basis: probe, all three apps. <sup>[f-a4](#fn-a4)</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — Promised decision updates never arrive** · 🐞 · user-visible.
The "Invitation Sent" dialog tells the inviter they "can be updated about the
user's decision on the Users & Roles page, your OJS notifications and/or your
email". After both accept and decline, every promised channel stays silent:
no notification, no email, and the pending row is removed outright. An
acceptance and a decline cannot be told apart from Users & Roles, except for
the new name an acceptance adds under Current Users.
Basis: probe, with a mail-delivery positive control. <sup>[f-a5](#fn-a5)</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — Small copy defects across these screens and emails** · 🐞 · minor.
The invitation email greets a new invitee by their email address even when a
name was entered, and offers roles "as a Author". The search step reads
"Enter at least one details…" and "…invite to take a additional roles". The
masthead confirmation reads "This will update whether this user appears on
the journal masthead for the selected role." on a press and a preprint
server too, under a column named "Press Masthead" or "Server Masthead". The
"Invitation Unavailable" page closes with "Please contact the
journal manager for further assistance." on presses and preprint servers as
well. Raw untranslated tokens ("##common.help##",
"##userAccess.management.options##") show on the management screens of all
three apps.
Basis: probe + claim check. <sup>[f-a7](#fn-a7)</sup>

<a id="a8"></a>
**A8 — Added role rows are invisible to a screen reader** · 🐞 · user-visible.
In the send wizard's roles table, every added row repeats the first row's
control identifiers, so each field label points back at row 1. A
screen-reader user editing the second or later row hears no name at all for
its role, start date, or masthead field, and cannot tell which row they are
changing. Sighted use is unaffected.
Basis: probe (accessibility-tree check). <sup>[f-a8](#fn-a8)</sup>

<a id="a9"></a>
**A9 — A disabled user's current roles can still be changed** · ❓ · minor.
On a disabled user's details step the warning says no role can be assigned,
and "Add Another Role" and "Save And Continue" are inactive (Rule 14). Yet
each current role keeps an active masthead select and an active "Remove
Role", on the search path as well as through the users list's Edit action.
Pressed through the Edit action (the search path's were seen active and not
pressed), both act at once as for any member (Rule 13): the role ends, and the disabled user is emailed "You
have been removed from a role", whose text tells them "Your account with
{journal} is still active and any other roles you previously held are still
active." On a journal the masthead change emails them too; on a press or
preprint server it answers the raw error of [OMP1](#omp1). The upstream
issue that brought the warning to this screen expects every field on it to be
inactive for a disabled user.
Question: should a disabled user's current roles stay editable on this
screen, and should a disabled user be emailed about the change? Lean: 🐞. The
issue states the intention, and the removal email's "still active" is untrue
for this person.
Basis: probe, all three apps. <sup>[f-a9](#fn-a9)</sup>

### OMP and OPS

<a id="omp1"></a>
**OMP1 — Masthead change throws a raw email-template error** · 🐞 · user-visible.
On a press or preprint server, confirming a masthead visibility change answers
the manager with a raw error: "Email template USER_ROLE_MASTHEAD_UPDATE not
found. The migration script I11800_AddUserRoleMastheadUpdateEmail needs to be
run." The change itself sticks after a reload. The same error can interrupt
an existing-user invitation mid-send on a press (it can be dismissed, and the
invitation still delivers). On a journal the change applies cleanly and the
member's notice is delivered. Fresh presses and preprint servers ship without
the email template this notice needs, so any new install reproduces it.
Basis: probe + install-seed check. <sup>[f-omp1](#fn-omp1)</sup>

### OPS

<a id="ops1"></a>
**OPS1 — Invitation email template hidden on OPS** · 🐞 · user-visible.
On a preprint server the Emails settings screen lists no row for "User
Invited to Role Notification". Search and the full list both answer "No
items found.", so a manager cannot review or customize the stored template.
Invitations still send and deliver using it. On journals and presses the row
is present with an Edit button. This reads as a side effect of the preprint
server keeping its own list of emails, not an intended trim: the template
ships seeded and is in active use.
Basis: probe + code. <sup>[f-ops1](#fn-ops1)</sup>

### Retired

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — Edit on a disabled member opens a broken wizard** · ✅ · retired. Fixed upstream (pkp/pkp-lib#13313, 2026-09-15), verified 2026-09-18 on OJS, OMP and OPS: Edit on a disabled user's row opens their details and current roles under "The user is currently disabled.", with no error (Rule 14); what stays open is [A9](#a9). <sup>[f-a6](#fn-a6)</sup>

<a id="footnotes"></a>
## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — Mount: `templates/management/access.tpl` places
`<user-invitation-manager>` (UI library `UserInvitationManager.vue`, atom
VUE-052) above the users grid inside `ManagementHandler::access()` (ROUTE-017's
`access` op, owned by the journal-identity/settings dispatcher row); screen
access is gated by `CanAccessSettingsPolicy` (site admin, or manager-level
groups with `permitSettings`). Row actions and dialogs:
`UserInvitationManagerStore.js` (`editInvite`, cancel →
`PUT invitations/{id}/cancel`). Button: locale key `invitation.inviteToRole.btn`
→ page `invitation/create/userRoleAssignment`. Gate live-probed 2026-07-31 on
all three apps: only managers and the
Site Administrator reach the screen; button label "Invite to a role" verbatim
everywhere.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — `PKP\pages\invitation\InitializeInvitationUIHandler` (ROUTE-013)
assigns ops `create`/`edit` to `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_ID_MANAGER`,
`ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT` (+ `ContextAccessPolicy`). The API
(`PKP\API\v1\invitations\InvitationController`, API-024) shared that
four-role list until pkp/pkp-lib#13340 (`0dce988b35`, `c767c313b9`,
2026-09-16; issue pkp/pkp-lib#13299, with the follow-up pkp/pkp-lib#13339
named in a code comment on the list). Since then its route group for listing,
reading, adding, populating, sending, previewing the email of and cancelling
an invitation lists `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` only, and the
`UserRoleAssignmentInvitePayload` validation (`UserGroupBelongsToContextRule`)
refuses a user group of another journal: "The provided user group does not
belong to the invitation's context". The page handler's list is unchanged, so
the mismatch of finding A1 now sits between the page on one side and both the
offering screen (note a) and the API on the other. Code-read 2026-09-17 on
OJS (lib/pkp `efbba94ae7`); the OMP and OPS lib/pkp pointers sit at
`360badeef5`, before the commits. The wizard's own flows are unchanged for
the Site Administrator and a Journal Manager (driven 2026-09-17 on OJS, two
scratch journals: a create-flow invitation to a user whose only role is in the
other journal and an edit-flow "Add Another Role" for a member of both, each
sent and accepted with every call answering 200).

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — Users-grid Edit → `ManagementHandler::editUser()` (ROUTE-017 rider) →
wizard in `editUser` mode: `UserRoleAssignmentInviteUIController::createHandle()`
with a user id — search step omitted (`SendInvitationStep::getSteps()` skips it
when a user or invitation is given), submit disabled until changes
(`isSubmitting` init in `UserInvitationPageStore.js`). Immediate actions from
`UserInvitationUserGroupsTable.vue`: `PUT users/{id}/endRole/{roleId}`
(“Remove Role”, blocked for the last active role —
`user.removeRole.roleRemainMessage`), `PUT users/{id}/masthead/{userUserGroupId}`.
Live-confirmed 2026-07-31 (edit-user probe): Edit on a member's row opened
the wizard with no search step — a two-step rail against the create flow's
three — showing read-only identity fields and the roles table with its
immediate Remove Role and masthead controls. Test run 2026-09-13 (Rule 13,
scenario 8; the OJS, OMP and OPS suites, OJS and OMP also by hand before
the run): Remove Role on a member's last active role opened the "Remove
Role" dialog "You cannot remove the role. At least one role must be assigned
to the user." with one "Close" button and sent no request — the table's own
`removeUserGroup` check on `numberOfActiveRoles` (roles without an end
date) fires before any `endRole` call — and after Close the row still held
its Remove Role button and masthead select; on a removable row the
confirmation read "Are you sure you want to remove this role? The user will
lose access and permissions associated with it." (`user.removeRole.message`,
buttons "Remove Role" / "Cancel"), and after confirming (`endRole` 200) the
row stayed listed with End Date set to that day and "User Removed From Role"
in its last cell, the same on the wizard reopened from the user row (OJS,
OPS). Basis: test run.

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — Statuses: `PKP\invitation\core\enums\InvitationStatus`
(`INITIALIZED`, `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `DECLINED`, `CANCELLED` — no EXPIRED
value; expiry is a timestamp check at read time). Single-live-invitation:
`Invitation::initialize()` deletes competing `INITIALIZED` rows of the same
type/target/journal; `Invitation::invite()` deletes competing `PENDING` rows
(`byNotId`). Replacement live-checked 2026-07-31 (claim check — Invitations table
before/after a second send to
the same address, both emailed links checked; OJS deep, OMP spot-check).

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — Deadline: `Invitation::invite()` →
`setExpiryDate(now + getExpiryDays())`;
`getExpiryDays()` = config `[invitations] expiration_days`
(SET-064; `config.TEMPLATE.inc.php` default 3, same in all three apps) with
code fallback `Invitation::DEFAULT_EXPIRY_DAYS = 3`. Cleanup:
`PKP\task\RemoveExpiredInvitations` (JOB-051, registered daily in
`PKPScheduler`, inherited by all three app schedulers) dispatches
`PKP\jobs\invitations\RemoveExpiredInvitationsJob` (JOB-013) →
`InvitationModel::expired()->delete()` — hard delete; `scopeExpired()` is
`expiry_date < now() OR expiry_date IS NULL`, and `INITIALIZED` drafts always
have a NULL expiry date (finding A2). Lifetime live-checked 2026-07-31 with
`expiration_days = 0`: a just-sent link already rendered the unavailable page
and its row never listed, while a pending control row still did.

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — Generic landing: `PKP\pages\invitation\InvitationHandler`
(ROUTE-014, AFFU-206), ops `accept`/`decline`/`confirmDecline`; link shape
`{journal}/invitation/accept?id={id}&key={key}` (built by
`InvitationHandler::getActionUrl()`; key is single-use plaintext in the email,
stored bcrypt-hashed). Lookup `Repo::invitation()->getByIdAndKey()` scopes
status PENDING + not expired, then verifies the key; a correct key on a
non-actionable row renders `invitation/invitationUnavailable.tpl`
(`invitation.unavailable.title`, buttons `user.login`,
`user.login.registerNewAccount`); anything else is a 404. Type dispatch:
`Invitation::getInvitationActionRedirectController()` — the reviewer one-click,
registration-validation and change-email invitation types route to their own
controllers through this same landing. Landing live-probed 2026-07-31: the
unavailable page renders after cancel, decline and expiry; a replaced
invitation's links 404 instead (finding A3).

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — Send wizard: `pages/userInvitation/UserInvitationPage.vue` +
`UserInvitationPageStore.js` (VUE-011), steps from
`PKP\invitation\stepTypes\SendInvitationStep` — `searchUser` (skips API
update), `userDetails`, `sendMail` (Composer: editable subject/body, template
picker via `emailTemplatesApiUrl`, CC/BCC; prefill from the mailable in note
j). API sequence: first advance past details →
`POST invitations/add/userRoleAssignment` + `PUT …/populate`; final submit →
populate + `PUT …/invite`. Back to step 1 resets the payload; Cancel dialog
only when `detectChanges`. Success dialog keys `userInvitation.modal.*`
(message text — finding A5); its "View All Users" button navigates to
`management/settings/access` (Users & Roles) — live-confirmed 2026-07-31 on
all three apps by claim check (an earlier live probe the same day had read
the pre-click wizard anchor, not the post-click page).

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `UserInvitationSearchFormStep.vue`: `GET users?searchPhrase=…&status=all`,
match order exact email → exact username → ORCID (orcid.org URI prefix
stripped); found → `userInvitation.search.userFound`, miss →
`userInvitation.search.userNotFound`; empty input → "Provide at least one
search criteria." (`invitation.searchForm.emptyError`). Live-checked
2026-07-31 (claim check): a malformed miss (`notanemail`)
advances to "Enter details" with the typed text discarded — the Email field
arrives empty and errors "This field is required when user id is not
present." on continue.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — `UserInvitationUserGroupsTable.vue` +
`UserInvitationDetailsFormStep.vue`: role select disables held/selected
groups; masthead select (`invitation.masthead.show`/`.hidden`) starts with no
value — inline "This field is required." until picked (claim check
2026-07-31: OJS and OMP) — and is the fixed text "Appear on
the masthead" for reviewer groups, with no select rendered (claim check
2026-07-31; on-screen text only — the public masthead page was not probed);
an added
row's END DATE cell renders "---" with no input (claim check 2026-07-31);
disabled-user warning `userInvitation.user.disable*` (on the search path and,
since pkp/pkp-lib#13313, on the users-grid Edit path, f-a6) and
`isSubmitting` also stuck while `userGroupsToAdd` is empty. Payload contract:
`userGroupsToAdd[]` = `{userGroupId, masthead (required bool), dateStart
(required date), dateEnd (optional)}` (`UserRoleAssignmentInvitePayload` +
rules `AllowedKeysRule`, `UserGroupExistsRule`, `AddUserGroupRule`,
`NoUserGroupChangesRule`). Live probe 2026-07-31: "Add
Another Role" alone enables "Save And Continue" — missing role fields error
inline on continue; disabled-user banner full text "The user is currently
disabled. The user was disabled. You cannot assign them a role while they are
disabled. Please enable the user first to invite them to a role.", with both
buttons disabled (enabled-user control passed). Re-driven 2026-09-18 on OJS,
OMP and OPS (Rule 14; scratch users disabled through the users grid's row
menu "Disable User" › "OK"): searched by email and by username, the step
opens under the heading "The user is currently disabled." with the same
paragraph, no new-role row, "Add Another Role" and "Save And Continue"
disabled; the Edit path shows the same (f-a6); the enabled control gets an
empty new-role row and both buttons active. The current roles' masthead
selects and "Remove Role" stay enabled on both paths (f-a9).

<a id="fn-j"></a>
**j** — Mailable `PKP\mail\mailables\UserRoleAssignmentInvitationNotify`
(MAIL-055), template key `USER_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_INVITATION`, variables
`recipientName`, `inviterName`, `inviterRole`, `rolesAdded` (with dates +
masthead visibility text), `existingRoles`, `acceptUrl`, `declineUrl`; sender
is the inviter. Sent only from `Invitation::invite()`. OPS divergence:
`ops-main/classes/mail/Repository::map()` overrides the base map without
merging and omits this mailable (comment: "OPS uses distinct mailables"),
while OJS/OMP `Repository::map()` merge the base list; the template key is
seeded in the OPS registry all the same, so sending works — finding OPS1.
Chain check: no app subclasses any invitation class; the API shim
`api/v1/invitations/index.php` is byte-identical in all three apps; no
app-name branches exist in shared invitation code.

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — Accept wizard: `pages/acceptInvitation/AcceptInvitationPage.vue` +
store (VUE-001), mounted by `acceptInvitation.tpl` (AFFU-122) from
`UserRoleAssignmentInviteRedirectController::acceptHandle()`; steps from
`PKP\invitation\stepTypes\AcceptInvitationStep::getSteps()` — ORCID step only
`if (!$user->hasVerifiedOrcid() && OrcidManager::isEnabled($context))`
(shared core `OrcidManager`, identical in all three apps); new-user chain
`verifyOrcid → userCreate → userDetails → userCreateReview`, existing-user
chain `verifyOrcid → userCreateReview`; the review step is present for every
recipient, so the store's empty-step auto-finalize branch is unreachable in
practice — live checks 2026-07-31 found no auto-accept with
ORCID off (its shipped state in the test contexts) or on. Step advance →
`PUT invitations/{id}/key/{key}/refine`;
final → `…/finalize`. Review-step Edit button renders only for new users
(`AcceptInvitationReview.vue`). ORCID buttons: `AcceptInvitationVerifyOrcid.vue`;
the wizard's primary button is hidden on that step.

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — `UserRoleAssignmentReceiveController::authorize()` calls
`Validation::registerUserSession($user)` for a signed-out existing invitee,
which reads as auto-login — but live probing (2026-07-31, two independent
runs) found the recipient signed out throughout the wizard and
after finalize (finding A4); the wizard simply never asks for credentials.
Signed-in non-invitee → refusal (store dialog keys
`acceptInvitation.authorization.shouldBeAnonymous` / `.message`, action
`user.logOut` — live-confirmed, the Logout button ends the session); new-user
invitations require an anonymous session. Key-based API ops
(`GET/PUT invitations/{id}/key/{key}/…`) are public routes with per-type
authorization.

<a id="fn-m"></a>
**m** — `UserRoleAssignmentReceiveController::finalize()`: creates the user
(username, names, email, country, affiliation, verified-ORCID data, password)
or backfills ORCID for an existing one; assigns each `userGroupsToAdd` row via
`Repo::userGroup()->assignUserToGroup(...)` with past `dateStart` clamped to
today; marks ACCEPTED. No recipient holds a session after finalize (finding
A4 — live-confirmed on all three apps) and no mail or notification goes to
the inviter (finding A5 — live-confirmed 2026-07-31 with a positive
control); the store's closing dialog
(`acceptInvitation.modal.*`, button "View All Submissions") redirects to the
`submissions` page, which greets the signed-out recipient with the sign-in
form.

<a id="fn-n"></a>
**n** — Decline: `declineInvitation.tpl` (AFFU-123) — POST + CSRF to
`invitation/confirmDecline`; base
`InvitationActionRedirectController::declineHandle()` throws
`GoneHttpException` unless PENDING;
`UserRoleAssignmentInviteRedirectController::confirmDecline()` marks DECLINED
and redirects to `login`. Live probe 2026-07-31: flow verbatim as
specified; after the decline both links render the unavailable page (note f),
not a bare gone response.

<a id="fn-o"></a>
**o** — Validation (`UserRoleAssignmentInvite` rules): `UsernameExistsRule`;
password `Password::min($site->getMinPasswordLength())` — the field's helper
text states the six-character default minimum (live-checked 2026-07-31; one
observation from this check is recorded in the maintainer's private security
file, not here); `EmailMustNotExistRule` at finalize —
`changeInvitationUserIdUsingUserEmail()` first converts an email invitation
into an existing-user invitation when the address has since registered;
privacy consent enforced client-side
(`acceptInvitation.privacyStatement.validation`), auto-satisfied for existing
users; `givenName` (primary locale) + `userCountry` required at
finalize/refine; existing-user invitations prohibit personal-detail overrides
(`ProhibitedIncludingNull`).

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — Listing: `GET invitations/userRoleAssignment`
(`InvitationController::getMany()`) scoped
`byType → byContextId → stillActive()` (= not expired AND status PENDING —
Eloquent groups the scope's OR internally); 5 rows per page; status cell is
always `userInvitation.status.invited` ("Invited {date}"). Columns: Name
(+ORCID icon), Email, Invitations (the offered roles), Status, Affiliation —
live-confirmed 2026-07-31.

<a id="fn-q"></a>
**q** — Cancel: `PUT invitations/{id}/cancel` → status CANCELLED (allowed only
while PENDING); the row is kept, so old links reach the unavailable page (note
f). Edit: dialog `userInvitation.edit.title`/`.message` → page
`invitation/edit/{id}` (`editHandle`, mode `edit`) — but the wizard store
starts with no invitation id even in edit mode, so the first advance
`POST`s a NEW invitation and `invite()` then deletes the old PENDING row
(note d) — hence the replaced row's hard-404 links (finding A3). Live
2026-07-31 (live probe): cancel and replacement flows verbatim; the
cancel confirmation's confirm button reads "Cancel Invitation" beside the
dismiss button "Cancel". Each pass through the edit wizard mints a fresh
draft (see f-a2).

<a id="fn-r"></a>
**r** — Removal email "You have been removed from a role"; masthead email
"Your journal masthead visibility has been updated"; the masthead dialog's
copy `user.masthead.update.message` ends "The user will be notified of this
change." (live probe 2026-07-31; both delivered on OJS). The removal
dialog's copy `user.removeRole.message` carries no such sentence: test run
2026-09-13, all three apps, the removal email delivered on each (the
2026-07-31 sentence had been read on the masthead dialog alone).
Masthead template key `USER_ROLE_MASTHEAD_UPDATE` — OMP/OPS seeding gap in
f-omp1.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Scenario seeding: every scenario but 9 gets a scratch context per
test and app from `POST scenarios/context` (`scenarios.md`), its tag
carrying app, scenario and run, every account a `users[]` entry
(`<username>@mail.test`, password the username twice), the Journal Manager
a `manager` role entry. Extra entries: scenario 3's user and scenario 7's
member an `author` entry; scenario 7's bystander a `reader` entry (any
signed-in account that is not the invitee, the manager included, serves);
scenario 8's member `roles: ['author', 'reader']`; scenario 10's context
passes `orcid: {}` (ORCID enabled on the dummy Public Sandbox pair; every
other context omits the key, which leaves ORCID off) and its user an
`author` entry with `orcid` (the sandbox example
`https://sandbox.orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097`) and `orcidIsVerified:
true`, the seed that stamps the live permission ORCID's own sign-in would
store. Invitee addresses are `rcpt<tag>@mail.test`, typed on "Search
User"; the subject marker typed on the compose step is `Invitation<tag>`
(scenario 6's first send `<tag>first`, its second `<tag>second`), and every
mailbox read is Mailpit scoped by the recipient plus that marker
(`pkpMail.find({to, contains})`), the accept and decline links pulled from
the message body; scenario 8's masthead email is read on OJS only (f-omp1).
Scenario 2's account is `acc<tag>` / `Password<tag>`, the refused control
`Pass5`. The offered role is one the invitee does not hold: Copyeditor on
OJS, Author or External Reviewer on OMP, Moderator on OPS; scenario 6's
replacement changes the row to a second such role (Author on OJS,
Copyeditor on OMP). Scenario 9 signs in as the seeded preprint server's
ready Preprint Server Manager (`manager.maya`) and only browses.

**f-a1** — Role assignment vs screen gate: note b vs note a. The atlas route
row records the same mismatch. Live check 2026-07-31, all three apps:
Author and Reviewer
denied at the wizard address; the section-editor and assistant-level outcomes
are recorded in the maintainer's private security file. OPS has no seeded
reviewer account, so that one cell was untestable. Re-checked 2026-09-17 on
OJS after pkp/pkp-lib#13340; the outcome for the section-editor and assistant
levels is again recorded in the maintainer's private security file.

<a id="fn-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — `scopeExpired()` includes `orWhereNull('expiry_date')` (note e);
`setExpiryDate()` only runs inside `invite()`, so drafts (`INITIALIZED`) always
have NULL expiry and match the delete. Drafts are invisible in the UI (listing
scope, note p), so the loss surfaces only as a failed wizard step. Live: one
edit-mode session created three draft invitations, only the last sent
(live probe 2026-07-31); the cleanup run itself was not exercised.

<a id="fn-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — Replacement path in note q: the old PENDING row is deleted by
`Invitation::invite()`'s `byNotId` cleanup, and `getByIdAndKey()`/the
unavailable-page fallback both need the row to exist (note f) → hard 404.
Cancellation keeps the row → friendly page. Live-confirmed 2026-07-31
(OJS and OPS): raw "404 Not Found", no journal styling.
Claim check 2026-07-31 (OJS deep,
OMP spot-check): a plain re-send to the same address kills the old accept
link the same way — same `byNotId` cleanup, not edit-specific.

<a id="fn-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — `finalize()` registers no session (note m) while the store then
redirects to `submissions`; the code's apparent existing-user auto-login
never materializes either (note l). Live-confirmed 2026-07-31 on OJS, OMP and
OPS, on both the accept and decline flows.

<a id="fn-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — Success-dialog copy: app locale key `userInvitation.modal.message`.
No accept/decline code path produces a notification or email to the inviter
(notes m, n). Live-confirmed 2026-07-31 (live probe, accept and decline
cases): bell/Tasks panel "No Items", inviter mailbox empty after both accept
and decline; positive control — an invitation sent afterwards delivered
normally.

<a id="fn-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — Users-grid Edit on a disabled member (live probe 2026-07-31): error
toast "The requested resource was not found.", empty roles table, no
disabled-user banner; the banner rendered only on the search path
(`userInvitation.user.disable*`, note i). Enabled-user control passed.
Cause: `PKPUserController::get()` read the user with `Repo::user()->get($userId)`,
which leaves disabled users out, so `GET users/{userId}` answered 404 and the
wizard opened empty. Fixed upstream by pkp/pkp-lib#13313 (lib/pkp
`2ecbd331ee`, 2026-09-15, Touhidur Rahman, "Disable user edit page load
fix"): the controller reads with `get($userId, true)` and
`UserRoleAssignmentInviteResource` passes a `disabled` flag in the invitation
payload, which the details step answers with the banner. The issue, still
open on 2026-09-18, states the intention: "Should not throw an error. I would
also assume that this user is disabled so all fields are disabled meaning
they can't be edited." Verified 2026-09-18 on OJS (ojs `7c8d69af3e` /
lib/pkp `14473fe784`), OMP (`c6a132892`) and OPS (`4bb66b1469`, both lib/pkp
`1bcd4dd55f`), each driven twice as a scratch manager and read once as
`admin`, with the kept check `shared/playwright/checks/sync/pkp-lib-13313/s18a.js`:
Edit on the row of a scratch user disabled through the row menu's "Disable
User" answers `GET users/{userId}` 200 and opens "STEP 1 - Enter details and
invite for roles" filled (email, names, the roles table with the user's
roles) under the banner, no error dialog, "Add Another Role" and "Save And
Continue" disabled, no new-role row; the enabled control opens the same step
with no banner and an active "Add Another Role". The first half of the
intention is met; the second is [A9](#a9)'s. Retired 2026-09-18.

<a id="fn-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — Copy items, all observed on live probes 2026-07-31: email
greeting by address and "as a Author" (invitation email); "journal masthead"
wording on OMP/OPS masthead dialogs (`user.masthead.update.message`, which
neither app's `locale/en/user.po` overrides; re-read verbatim by the
2026-09-13 OMP and OPS test runs beside the "Press Masthead" / "Server
Masthead" column); search-step grammar "Enter at least
one details…" / "…invite to take a additional roles"; raw locale keys
`##common.help##` and `##userAccess.management.options##` on the management
screens of all three apps; and (claim check 2026-07-31) the
unavailable-page tail "Please contact the journal manager for further
assistance." unsubstituted on OMP and OPS.

<a id="fn-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — Every added row in `UserInvitationUserGroupsTable.vue` renders
`#-userGroupId-control`, `#-dateStart-control`, `#-masthead-control` — the
same ids as row 1 (empty `formId` segment in `FieldBase.compileId()`) — so
every `label[for]` resolves to the first row's control; no
`aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` anywhere in the table, and the aria snapshot
shows row 2's combobox/textbox without an accessible name. Observed
2026-07-31 (claim check —
duplicate-id scan + aria snapshot on OJS; shared component, all three apps).

<a id="fn-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — The payload's `disabled` flag (f-a6) gates the banner
(`UserInvitationDetailsFormStep.vue`), the new-role rows and "Add Another
Role" (`UserInvitationUserGroupsTable.vue`) and the continue button
(`isSubmitting` in `UserInvitationPageStore.js`); the same table's
current-role rows render their masthead `FieldSelect` and "Remove Role"
without reading it. Live 2026-09-18 on OJS, OMP and OPS
(tips and kept check as in f-a6; a scratch user holding Author and Reader,
disabled through the users grid's row menu, opened through Edit): "Remove
Role" on the Reader row opened the usual confirmation and, confirmed,
`PUT users/{userId}/endRole/{userGroupId}` answered 200, the row showing End
Date today and "User Removed From Role"; the disabled user's mailbox then
held "You have been removed from a role" (`USER_ROLE_END`, whose body carries
the "still active" sentence). The masthead select on the Author row opened
"Confirm masthead visibility change"; "Cancel" put the value back; "Confirm"
saved with `PUT users/{userId}/masthead/{userGroupId}` 200 and a second email
on OJS, and answered 500 with OMP1's error dialog on OMP and OPS, no email.
A second disabled user met on the search path showed the same enabled
controls, left unpressed, and received nothing, as did both enabled controls
and the disabling itself. Whether the search path showed these controls
enabled before 2026-09-15 was not traced; the Edit path could not reach them
until then (f-a6). Intention: the issue's sentence quoted in f-a6.

<a id="fn-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — Error observed on OMP and OPS (live probes 2026-07-31, two
independent sessions; re-read word for word by the 2026-09-13 OMP and OPS
test runs: the "Error" dialog with its one "OK" button, the PUT answering
500 on the press, the select holding the new value after OK and after a reload, no
masthead email); OJS control clean, member's email delivered (note r).
Install-seed check 2026-07-31: only OJS's `registry/emailTemplates.xml` seeds
`USER_ROLE_MASTHEAD_UPDATE`; the OMP and OPS registries carry no masthead
template, and the `I11800_AddUserRoleMastheadUpdateEmail` migration adds it
on upgraded installs only — omp_test/ops_test hold 0 such default rows vs 2
in ojs_test, so fresh installs reproduce the error.

<a id="fn-ops1"></a>
**f-ops1** — Evidence in note j (OPS map override vs seeded template).
Live-confirmed 2026-07-31 (live probes, all three apps): "User Invited
to Role Notification" listed with an Edit button on OJS and OMP; OPS search
and full list answer "No items found."; the OPS invitation email sent and
delivered in the same session.
