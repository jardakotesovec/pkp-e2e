# Monograph landing page {OMP}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

Every published book of a press has a public page of its own, the
**book's page**: the page a reader reaches from the catalog, a series or
category page, a search result, the home page's lists, a link someone
shared or the book's address typed by hand. It shows what the book is
(title, contributors, synopsis, keywords, dates and versions, series,
categories, references, how to cite it), its **table of contents** (the
chapters of the shown version), and the files readers get: each
publication format the press made available, as a link to a remote copy
or to its files. A free file opens in a view page of its own (a PDF in a
PDF viewer, an HTML file in an HTML page) or downloads under its file
name; a file for sale leads a signed-in reader to the press's payment
page. A chapter whose "Chapter Page" box is
ticked gets a **chapter page** of its own, reached from the table of
contents. This spec describes the book's page, the chapter pages, their
addresses and versions, the two view pages, the purchase of a file up to
the payment page, and the "How to Cite" block and "Downloads" chart as a
press shows them. <sup>a</sup>

Several blocks on the page are described by the feature that fills them:
the contributors and their biographies
([Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md)),
the "License", copyright, "Data Availability Statement" and "Funding
Statement" blocks ([Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md)),
"Funders" ([Funding](U43-funding.md)), the "DOI:" lines
([DOIs](U45-dois.md)), a format's URN
([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)), the "References" block's content
([Citations & references](U42-citations-and-references.md)), the images
of an HTML file ([Media files](U47-media-files.md)) and the page's
metadata for search engines
([Search engine metadata & analytics](U20-search-engine-metadata-and-analytics.md)).
What a press builds for this page is built elsewhere: the formats, their
files and terms in
[Publication formats & proof terms](U73-publication-formats-proof-terms.md),
the chapter list in [Chapters & work type](U72-chapters-work-type.md), the
catalog entry (cover, series, categories, URL Path) in
[Catalog management](U70-catalog-management.md). The payment page itself
and the press's payment settings are
[Payments & APCs](U52-payments-and-apcs.md)'. <sup>a</sup>

A journal and a preprint server do not install the book's page. Their
published item's page is the article's (the preprint's) page of
[Article landing page & reading](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md),
which has galleys in place of publication formats, no table of contents
and no chapter pages. A journal that sells articles marks with its price
the galley links of an article published in an issue whose "Access
status" is "Subscription" ("Requires Subscription or Fee PDF (USD 5)",
[Subscriptions](U51-subscriptions.md)); a preprint server sells nothing.
On both, the journal's (server's) address followed by "catalog/book/"
and a number answers the "404 Not Found" page. <sup>b</sup> <sup>td1</sup>

## Actors & permissions

The pages are public: a **visitor** needs no account, and signing in, as
a Reader or in any other role, changes nothing in a published version's
pages. A press that requires visitors to sign in ("Users must be
registered and log in to view the press site.") or that the Site
Administrator has not enabled ("Enable this press to appear publicly on
the site") sends a signed-out visitor who opens any address of this spec
to the Login page ([Journal identity & about
pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md), its Rule 22). "The
assistant roles" below are the press's Copyeditor, Designer, Funding
coordinator, Indexer, Layout Editor, Marketing and sales coordinator,
Proofreader and Editorial Board Member. <sup>c</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Read a published book's page and its chapter pages** (the current version, or an older one at its own address) | • anyone, signed in or not (Rules 1–4) <sup>c</sup> |
| **Open an unpublished version's page** (the preview) | • the Press manager, Press editor, Production editor, Series editor and the assistant roles, assigned or not, and the Site Administrator, under the preview notice (a Series editor or assistant role not assigned to the book is meant to open it once the book has reached copyediting or production, but it opens for them at every earlier stage too, a declined book included ⚠ [A27](#a27)), and its chapter pages too, though a new version's fail on a "DOI Versioning" "No" press [A19](#a19) (Rule 5); the workflow's "Preview" opens it for those it is offered to ([Workflow screen & stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md), its Rule 6)<br>• the book's Author, by typing the page's address<br>• anyone else gets the "404 Not Found" page (Rule 3): a visitor, a Reader, a Reviewer, and an Author, Volume editor, Chapter Author or Translator of the press who is not on the book<br>• a submission its author never finished answers "404 Not Found" to everyone, the Press manager, the Site Administrator and its own Author included <sup>c</sup> <sup>td5</sup> |
| **Open a free file** ("Open Access" terms) | • anyone who may read the page (Rule 13)<br>• on a preview, no one: every file's link opens the "404 Not Found" page (Rule 5c) [A24](#a24)<br>• on a press with "Users must be registered and log in to view open access content." ticked (Settings bullet 6): signed-in users only; a visitor who presses a free file's link gets the Login page first, and once signed in there the file's view page <sup>j</sup> <sup>td13</sup> |
| **Buy a file for sale** ("Direct Sales" terms) | • a signed-in user, whatever the role (the press's own staff and the Site Administrator too), on a press whose payment method is set up and that has a currency (Rule 14)<br>• a visitor gets the Login page first, and once signed in there not the payment page but the page an ordinary sign-in opens for their role, and a newcomer who registers from that Login page "Registration complete" (Rule 14) [A18](#a18) <sup>k</sup> <sup>td14</sup> |
| **Receive the "Manual Payment Notification"** | • the press's principal contact, when a buyer presses "Send notification of payment" (Side effects) <sup>q</sup> |
| **Show the citation in another format; download a citation** | • anyone who may read the page, while the "Citation Style Language" plugin is on (Rule 19)<br>• on a preview, the Press manager, Press editor, Production editor, the Site Administrator and a Series editor or assistant role assigned to the book; for the book's Author, and for a Series editor or assistant role not assigned to it, another format changes nothing and a download opens the "404 Not Found" page ⚠ [A21](#a21) <sup>m</sup> <sup>td18</sup> |
| **Change the settings of "Settings that modify behavior"** | • whoever opens the Settings pages ([→ settings access](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md#settings-access)), on Settings › Website › "Plugins" ([Plugins management](U62-plugins-management.md#plugin-links)), "Appearance" and Settings › Distribution › "Payments"; "Enable this press to appear publicly on the site" the Site Administrator <sup>r</sup> |
| **Decide what the pages show** (formats, files and terms, chapters, catalog entry, contributors) | • the roles the building features name: [Publication formats & proof terms](U73-publication-formats-proof-terms.md), [Chapters & work type](U72-chapters-work-type.md), [Catalog management](U70-catalog-management.md), [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md) |

## Fields & validation

The book's page, the chapter page and the payment page carry the press's
header and footer ([Navigation menus & site
chrome](U08-navigation-menus-and-site-chrome.md)) and, while blocks are
placed, the sidebar; the two view pages carry none of these, only their
own bar. The book's page and the chapter page have no trail ("Home / …")
above the title; the payment page has "Home / Manual Fee Payment". A part
appears only when the version has something to put in it (Rule 7),
except the "References" heading and the copyright line. <sup>d</sup>

<a id="book-page"></a>
**The book's page.** The browser tab reads "{title} | {press name}", or
"{title}: {subtitle} | {press name}" when the version has a subtitle, the
title being the current version's even on an older version's page
⚠ [A5](#a5). Two columns: the main column with the book's text, and
beside it a narrower column with the cover, the files and the details.
Top to bottom, the main column holds: <sup>d</sup>

([Funding](U43-funding.md), its Rule 9).

<a id="chapter-page"></a>
**The chapter page.** Opened from a chapter's title in the table of
contents (Rule 15). The browser tab reads "{chapter title} | {press
name}", or "{chapter title}: {subtitle} | {press name}" when the chapter
has a subtitle ("Tides: Low and high | …"). Main column, top to bottom:
<sup>e</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Notice** | — | The older-version notice of Rule 18. |
| **Title**, **subtitle** | — | The chapter's title and subtitle as the page heading. <sup>e</sup> |

Side column, top to bottom: <sup>e</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Cover** | — | The same cover picture as the book version's page, here a link to that page. <sup>e</sup> |
| **Files** | — | The chapter's files, as the book page's side column lists files (Rule 11); no remote format. <sup>e</sup> |
| **"Volume"** | — | The book version's title, a link to its book page. <sup>e</sup> |

| **"How to Cite"** | — | The chapter's citation (Rule 19). |

<a id="pdf-view"></a>
**The PDF view page.** Opened from a free PDF file while "PDF.js PDF
Viewer" is on (Rule 13). The browser tab reads "{format name} view of the
file {file name}" ("PDF view of the file article.pdf"). A bar across the
top holds, left to right: <sup>f</sup> <sup>td22</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Return arrow** | — | An arrow with no visible text; a screen reader reads "Return to view details about {title}", the title of the file's version (an older version's own title on its file). Opens the book's current page. <sup>f</sup> |
| **File name** | — | The file's name, plain text. <sup>f</sup> |
| **"Download"** | — | Downloads the PDF under its file name, the page staying as it is; a screen reader reads "Download Download PDF". <sup>f</sup> |

Under the bar the PDF viewer fills the page and shows the PDF, with its
own page, zoom, search, print and download controls; the viewer's own
download button also saves the file under its name. On an older
version's file an outdated-version notice sits between the bar and the
viewer (Rule 13a). Each time the page opens, its own script also fails,
which the reader does not see: the browser's console reads "PDFJS is
not defined" ⚠ [A23](#a23). <sup>f</sup>

<a id="html-view"></a>
**The HTML view page.** Opened from a free HTML file while "HTML
Monograph File" is on (Rule 13). The browser tab reads as the PDF view
page's ("HTML view of the file {file name}"). A bar across the top holds
only a return arrow, which opens the book's page and whose name for a
screen reader is a raw code, "##monograph.return##" ⚠ [A10](#a10), and
the title of the file's version as a link that opens the book's current
page; there is no "Download". Under the bar the HTML file fills the
page, with its images ([Media files](U47-media-files.md), its Rule 5);
on an older version's file the outdated-version notice (Rule 13a) sits
between them. <sup>f</sup>
<sup>td21</sup>
A link in the file written "omp://press", the plugin's shorthand for
the press, opens the press's home page. In a file that also holds a
link to another book, written "omp://monograph/{number}", the file
shows but none of its "omp://" links works: each keeps its written
address, and pressing it does nothing ⚠ [A25](#a25). <sup>td26</sup>

**The payment page.** A buyer's "Purchase" link leads to the payment page
of the press's method. With "Manual Fee Payment" it is headed "Manual
Fee Payment" and reads, top to bottom: the press's "Manual Payment
Instructions"; "Title" with the file's name and "Fee" with the file's
price and the press's currency code in brackets ("25.00 (USD)"), both
values in bold; then "Send notification of payment" as an underlined
link, not a button. A journal's page puts the instructions under
"Title" and "Fee" and shows the link as a button
([Payments & APCs](U52-payments-and-apcs.md#manual-page)). <sup>k</sup> <sup>td14</sup>

## Rules & state

**Reaching the page**

1. **What leads there.** The book summaries of the catalog, a series'
   page, "New Releases", a category's page and the home page's lists
   ([→ book summary](U68-catalog-browse.md#book-summary)); a search
   result ([Search](U15-search.md)); the Catalog page's "View Entry"
   ([Catalog management](U70-catalog-management.md)); the workflow
   header's "View" and "Preview" ([Workflow screen & stage
   access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md), its Rule 6); and, on
   a chapter page, the cover and "Volume" (Rule 18). <sup>g</sup>
2. **The page's address.** The press's address followed by
   "catalog/book/" and the book's number, or its **URL Path** once one is
   saved on the "Catalog Entry" page ([Catalog
   management](U70-catalog-management.md)). With a URL Path saved, the
   press's own links use it, except a chapter page's cover and "Volume",
   which use the book's number; the number address still opens the same
   page without changing the address. An address with a URL Path the
   book used before is meant to forward to the current one; today it
   shows a server error page ⚠ [A16](#a16). <sup>g</sup> <sup>td2</sup>
3. **Nothing published, no page.** A book is published once a Version of
   Record of it is published. Until then its address answers the "404 Not
   Found" page to a visitor and to a Reader, and so does the address of
   any of its versions. A scheduled book answers the same until its date.
   A book whose only published version is an "Author Original" (a version
   added with "Create New Version" and the "Publication Stage" "Author
   Original (AO)") answers the same to a visitor and a Reader, as the
   catalog leaves it out
   too ([Catalog browse](U68-catalog-browse.md), its Rule 3), while the
   Press manager and the Site Administrator who type its address get its
   page with no preview notice ⚠ [A2](#a2). <sup>g</sup> <sup>td3</sup>
   - 3a. **An address that names no book.** A number or URL Path that no
     book of the press has sends a visitor to the Login page, and a
     signed-in user to an error page with no heading, its browser tab
     "| {press name}", reading "An invalid published submission was
     specified.". An unpublished book's address answers "404 Not Found"
     instead ⚠ [A1](#a1). <sup>g</sup> <sup>td4</sup>

**Versions**

4. **Which version the page shows.** The book's address shows the
   **current version**, the latest published one. Each older published
   version has an address of its own, reached from the "Versions" list
   (Rule 9): the book's address followed by "/version/" and an id the
   link carries, not the version's number. A version address that names
   an unpublished version of the book answers the "404 Not Found" page to
   a visitor; one whose id names no version of the book fails with a
   server error page ⚠ [A3](#a3). <sup>g</sup> <sup>td6</sup>
5. **The preview.** An unpublished version's page opens for those Actors
   row 2 names under the notice "This is a preview and has not been
   published. View submission". It looks as it will once published,
   except for its dates: a version with no date saved has no "Published"
   line and no "Versions" list; one with a date saved has the line
   ("Forthcoming" for a date after today, Rule 8) and a "Versions"
   heading listing only the book's published versions, none on a book
   never published. <sup>g</sup> <sup>td7</sup>
   - 5a. **"View submission".** It opens the book's workflow for those
     whose workflow offers "Preview". The book's Author gets the
     access-denied page instead, as on an article's preview
     ([→ Article landing page & reading, A5](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md#a5)),
     and a Series editor or assistant role not assigned to the book gets
     the Submissions page behind an "Error" window reading "The current
     role does not have access to this operation." with "OK".
   - 5b. **Chapter pages and new versions.** The unpublished book's
     chapter pages open for the same people, without the preview notice
     ⚠ [A17](#a17). A new version being prepared for a published book,
     opened at its version address, carries the older-version notice of
     Rule 6 under the preview notice ⚠ [A4](#a4). The notice is dated
     today, or, once a "Date Published" is saved on the version's
     "Catalog Entry", with that date. On a press whose "DOI Versioning"
     reads "No" (Settings bullet 15), the new version's chapter links
     open a blank server error page [A19](#a19).
   - 5c. **Files.** The preview lists the version's formats and files
     as a published page does (Rule 11), but every file's link opens the
     "404 Not Found" page, for everyone who may open the preview: no file
     can be read from a preview ⚠ [A24](#a24).
6. **An older version's notice.** An older version's page opens with
   "This is an outdated version published on {date}. Read the most recent
   version.", the date being that version's own, in the press's short
   date format; "most recent version" opens the book's address. The page
   is headed with the older version's title, but the browser tab reads
   the current version's title [A5](#a5). <sup>g</sup> <sup>td8</sup>
7. **Empty parts are left out.** Every part of the page's tables appears
   only when the version has something to put in it, except the
   "References" heading and the copyright line. A book with a title, one
   contributor, an abstract and no chapter, format, series or category
   shows the title, the contributor, "Synopsis", the "References" heading
   with nothing under it, the cover (the default picture), "Published"
   and "Versions" and the copyright line "Copyright (c) {year} {press
   name}", and no other heading. <sup>d</sup> <sup>td24</sup>
8. **The date line.** Under "Published": the first version's page, its
   date; a later version's, "{first version's date} — Updated on {this
   version's date}", both in the press's long date format ([Appearance &
   theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), its Rule 31), such as "March
   5, 2024". A shown version dated after today, which only a preview
   shows, reads "Forthcoming" in place of "Published". <sup>h</sup>
   <sup>td9</sup>
   - 8a. **The first date.** It is the earliest date any version of the
     book carries, published or not, and a version with no date yet, such
     as one just made with "Create New Version", counts as today: while
     it exists, every version's line reads "{today} — Updated on {that
     version's date}"
     ([→ Publish, schedule & versions, A6](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#a6)).
9. **The "Versions" list.** Every published version, the newest first,
   each as "{date} ({version name})" in the short date format:
   "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)". The list shows with a single
   version too. The version shown is plain text; the current version
   links to the book's address and each older one to its own address
   (Rule 4). A version not yet published, or unpublished since, is not
   listed. <sup>h</sup> <sup>td23</sup>

**Contents, formats and files**

10. **The table of contents.** The shown version's chapters, in the
    order of its Chapters page: the order they were added in, until
    another is saved there with "Order" and "Done" ([Chapters & work
    type](U72-chapters-work-type.md), its Rule 8a). An order saved on a
    published version shows the next time the book's page opens, with
    nothing published again: a page that listed "Tides", "Harbours",
    "Estuaries" lists "Estuaries", "Tides", "Harbours" once "Estuaries"
    is moved above "Tides". Each chapter is listed with: <sup>i</sup> <sup>td10</sup>
    - its title and subtitle, a link to its chapter page when the
      chapter has one (Rule 15), plain text otherwise; on an older
      version's page it opens that version's chapter page only where Rule
      15a allows [A19](#a19);
    - its authors' names, joined by commas. The line is meant to be left
      out when the chapter's authors are the book's, but it is shown for
      every chapter that has authors ⚠ [A6](#a6);
    - its DOI as "DOI: https://doi.org/…", a link ([DOIs](U45-dois.md));
    - the files of the chapter (a format file ticked in the chapter's
      "Files"), as links grouped by format in the order of the
      Publication Formats page, which moves a format to the end of its
      list when it is saved
      ([→ Publication formats & proof terms, A14](U73-publication-formats-proof-terms.md#a14)),
      each link as Rule 11 words it.
11. **The files and remote formats.** The side column lists the formats
    of the shown version that read "Available" ([Publication formats &
    proof terms](U73-publication-formats-proof-terms.md), its Side
    effects), in the order of the Publication Formats page (Rule 10):
    <sup>i</sup>
    - a remote format as a link reading the format's name, which opens
      its remote address in a new tab;
    - each file with "Open Access" or "Direct Sales" terms that no chapter
      holds, under its format. A file a chapter holds is listed under
      that chapter only (Rule 10). A file set "Not Available", or with no
      terms, is not listed, and a format with no listed file and no
      remote address shows nothing here.
    - 11a. **The link text.** A format with one listed file shows one
      link reading the format's name, such as "PDF". A "Direct Sales"
      file on a press with a currency reads "{price} Purchase {format}
      ({price} {currency code})", the price as typed in the file's terms:
      "25.00 Purchase PDF (25.00 USD)", the price twice ⚠ [A7](#a7). On a
      press with no currency it reads the format's name alone, like a
      free file
      ([→ Publication formats & proof terms, A9](U73-publication-formats-proof-terms.md#a9)).
    - 11b. **A format with several files.** The format's name, then for
      each file its name followed by a link reading the file's name
      again, the files in no fixed order (the same steps taken twice
      listed a format's two files either way round). The link never
      shows a price, so a file for sale there looks
      like a free one until it is pressed ⚠ [A8](#a8). <sup>td11</sup>
    - 11c. **The link address.** The press's address followed by
      "catalog/view/", the book's URL Path or number, the format's URL
      Path or number and the file's number; on an older version's page
      "version/" and the version's id follow the book's part.
12. **A format's details.** Each available format that also reads
    "Approved" gets a block in the side column, in format order, holding
    what the format has of: <sup>p</sup> <sup>td12</sup>
    - its name as a small heading, only when the version has more than
      one available format (a screen reader reads "Details about the
      available publication format: {format}", or "Details about this
      monograph" for a single format);
    - each identification code, its type's name with its code as the
      label ("ISBN-13 (15)") and the code under it;
    - each publication date, its role's name with its code as the label
      ("Publication date (01)") and the date under it, written
      2024-03-05; a date entered in the "Date Format" the date's window
      preselects, "YYYYMMDD (H)", adds "Hijri Calendar" under it;
    - its URN ([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md), its
      [OMP2](U44-identifiers.md#omp2)) and its DOI as "DOI:" and a link
      ([DOIs](U45-dois.md), its Rule 43);
    - for a physical format, "Physical Dimensions" with its width, height
      and thickness joined by " x ", each with its unit.
    A format with none of these gets no block. A format that reads
    "Awaiting Approval" gets none, while its files and remote link are
    listed all the same (Rule 11).

**Opening and buying files**

13. **Opening a free file.** What a free file's link does depends on the
    file: <sup>j</sup> <sup>td13</sup>
    - a PDF, including one of a supplementary component such as
      "Appendix", opens the PDF view page (Fields) while "PDF.js PDF
      Viewer" is on (Settings bullet 1);
    - an HTML file opens the HTML view page (Fields) while "HTML
      Monograph File" is on (Settings bullet 2); off, its link downloads
      the file under its file name;
    - any other file (an EPUB, a Markdown file), or a PDF with the
      viewer off, downloads under its file name, the browser staying on
      the book's page.
    - 13a. **An older version's file.** Its view page carries the notice
      "This is an outdated version published on {date}. Read the most
      recent version.", the date written year-month-day ("2026-09-28"),
      whose link opens the book's current page.
    - 13b. **Where a file fails.** On a preview no file opens (Rule 5c)
      [A24](#a24). An HTML file that links another book shows, but its
      "omp://" links do nothing (Fields, the HTML view page)
      [A25](#a25).
    - 13c. **Sign-in for free files.** On a press with "Users must be
      registered and log in to view open access content." ticked
      (Settings bullet 6), a visitor who presses a free file's link gets
      the Login page first, and once signed in there the file's view
      page.
14. **Buying a file for sale.** A "Direct Sales" file's link, on a press
    whose payment method is set up (Settings bullet 9): <sup>k</sup> <sup>td14</sup>
    - pressed by a visitor, leads to the Login page, which says nothing
      of the purchase (only "Required fields are marked with an
      asterisk: *" above the form). Once signed in there, the buyer does
      not reach the payment page but lands where an ordinary sign-in
      takes their role: a Reader on the press's home page, an Author on
      "My Submissions" (headed "Active submissions"), a Press manager on
      the Dashboard's list headed "Assigned to me". A newcomer who presses "Register" on that Login
      page and sends the form lands on "Registration complete", signed
      in ⚠ [A18](#a18);
    - pressed by a signed-in user, whatever the role (the press's own
      staff and the Site Administrator too), opens the payment page at
      once. With "Manual Fee Payment", "Send notification of payment"
      emails the press (Side effects) and shows "Payment Notification"
      with "Payment notification sent" and "Continue" ([Payments &
      APCs](U52-payments-and-apcs.md), its Rule 10); "Continue" leads
      back to the file's link, which opens the payment page again. A
      press has no list of payments.
      No screen records a manual payment, so a buyer who paid by hand
      never gets the file ⚠ [A11](#a11).
    - with "Paypal Fee Payment", the link opens that method's payment
      page ([Payments & APCs](U52-payments-and-apcs.md), its Rule 9); on
      a press with only its "Account Name" filled (no "Client ID" or
      "Secret"), a page with no heading reading "A transaction error
      occurred. Please contact the press manager for details.".
    - 14a. **Where the purchase stops.** On a press with no currency, or
      whose method is not set up (no "Manual Payment Instructions", no
      PayPal "Account Name"), a signed-in user who presses the link is
      sent to the catalog page with no message
      ([→ Publication formats & proof terms, A9](U73-publication-formats-proof-terms.md#a9)).
    - 14b. **"Enable" is not read.** Whether the press's "Payments" tab
      has "Enable" ticked changes nothing here: with it unticked and the
      currency and method kept, the file is still sold ⚠ [A12](#a12).
      <sup>td15</sup>

**Chapter pages**

15. **Which chapters get a page.** A chapter whose "Chapter Page" box is
    ticked, or that has a DOI ([Chapters & work
    type](U72-chapters-work-type.md), its Rule 10), has a page at the
    book's address followed by "/chapter/" and the chapter's number. The
    number stays the same in every version that carries the chapter.
    The address of a chapter without its page, or of a chapter the shown
    version does not carry, answers the "404 Not Found" page. <sup>l</sup>
    - 15a. **An older version's chapter page.** Its address is
      "…/version/{id}/chapter/{number}". It opens only on a press whose
      "DOI Versioning" reads "Yes" (Settings bullet 15); on any other
      press it shows a server error page ⚠ [A19](#a19).
16. **The chapter's date line.** Under "Published", on a book whose
    "Publication Dates" reads "Each chapter may have its own publication
    date." (Settings bullet 11), the chapter's own "Date Published" when
    it has one; otherwise the version's date. A later version of the
    chapter reads "{first date} — Updated on {this date}", the first date
    being the chapter's in the first version that carries it; with the
    chapters' own dates, a new version copies the chapter's "Date
    Published", so the line repeats that date ⚠ [A20](#a20). A chapter new
    in a later version reads that version's date alone. <sup>l</sup>
    - 16a. **"Forthcoming".** The heading reads "Forthcoming" when the
      version's date lies after today. The chapter page compares the two
      dates as written in the press's "Date (Short)" format, and only
      the year-first format a press starts with ("2026-10-01") sorts
      them in date order. Under each of the three other choices
      ("01-10-2026", "10/01/2026", "01.10.2026"), or a "Custom" one such
      as "d/m/Y", the heading can come out wrong, depending on the day
      the page is read: a chapter of a book published on December 31,
      2024 and read on October 1, 2026 is headed "Forthcoming", and in
      the preview a chapter of a book scheduled for January 1, 2027 is
      headed "Published" ⚠ [A13](#a13). <sup>td16</sup>
17. **The chapter's "Versions" list.** Shown only when the book has more
    than one published version: every published version, newest first,
    as on the book's page. A version that carries the chapter links to
    the chapter's page in that version (the shown one plain text; an
    older one's link, Rule 15a); the oldest of them, when older versions
    exist, adds " — Chapter created". A version without the chapter is
    plain text; after the chapter's creation it reads "{date} ({version
    name}) — Without this chapter". <sup>l</sup> <sup>td17</sup>
18. **The chapter page's links.** The cover and "Volume" open the book's
    page in the shown version. On an older version's chapter page (Rule
    15a) the notice "This is an outdated version published on {date}.
    Read the most recent version." leads to the chapter's current page
    when the current version carries the chapter, and to the book's page
    otherwise. <sup>l</sup>

**Around the page**

19. **"How to Cite".** While the "Citation Style Language" plugin is on
    (Settings bullet 3), the book's page and every chapter page end their
    side column with the "How to Cite" block, whose parts, formats,
    downloads and settings window are those of an article's page
    ([→ How to Cite](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md#how-to-cite),
    its Rules 15a, 15b and 16). <sup>m</sup> <sup>td18</sup>
    - 19a. **A book's citation.** On the book's page it cites the shown
      version as a book: its authors (a contributor whose role is "Volume
      editor" as an editor, one whose role is "Translator" as a
      translator), its title, its series position, which "APA" prints as
      "(Vols. 3)" ⚠ [A22](#a22) and "MLA" leaves out (the series' title
      reaches only the "BibTeX" and "RIS" files), the press as
      publisher, the version's date, and the book's DOI link or, without
      a DOI, its address. A book with no contributor (one a Press
      manager submitted without an entry for themselves) is cited from
      its title.
    - 19b. **A chapter's citation.** On a chapter page it cites the
      chapter: its authors, its title, "In" the book's contributors (on a
      Monograph its authors, left out when they are the chapter's own; on
      an Edited Volume its volume editors "(Ed.)" and translators
      "(Trans.)", then any contributor with the "Author" role), the
      book's title, its series position and the chapter's pages ("(Vols.
      3, pp. 1-20)"), the press, and the chapter's DOI link or, without
      a DOI, its address. On a later version the "APA" citation adds
      "(Original work published {year})", the book's first year, even for
      a chapter that version added ⚠ [A14](#a14).
20. **The "Downloads" chart.** While "Usage statistics display options"
    (Settings bullet 5) is on a chart, the book's page carries a section
    headed "Downloads" with a bar or a line chart of the book's
    downloads by month, as an article's page does
    ([Article landing page & reading](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md),
    its Rule 17, and its [A3](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md#a3)).
    A chapter page has no chart. <sup>n</sup> <sup>td19</sup>
    - 20a. **Months and files.** The chart shows the last twelve months.
      When the book has downloads from earlier months, a button "All
      time" under it widens the chart to every month from January of the
      first year with downloads, and then reads "Last 12 months".
      Downloads of a supplementary component's file, such as "Appendix",
      are not charted ([Usage statistics](U64-usage-statistics.md), its
      Rule 1).
21. **The pages in French.** With French (Canada) as the interface
    language, two texts read wrong ⚠ [A15](#a15): <sup>o</sup> <sup>td20</sup>
    - in "Versions": each version's name, as "{date}
      (##publication.versionStage.display##)" with the date in the
      press's short format ("2026-09-28
      (##publication.versionStage.display##)");
    - a priced file's link reads "25.00 Achat (25.00 USD)", without the
      format's name.
    - 21a. **What is translated.** "Synopsis", "Versions", "Séries",
      "Mots-clés :" and the notices.
22. **Open peer review.** The page carries no reviews. An "Open" review
    can be made public: "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" ticked in the
    reviewer row's "Edit" window before "Mark as Complete", whose dialog
    then adds "This review will be made publicly visible alongside the
    article."
    ([→ Reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#read-review),
    its Rule 14a), or arriving ticked on every new request of a press
    that makes reviews public by default (Settings bullet 16). Once the
    book is published, its page shows neither that review's comments,
    nor the reviewer's name, nor any review heading, to a visitor, a
    Reader or the Press manager. The page reads as for a book whose
    review was left private ⚠ [A26](#a26). <sup>t</sup>

## Side effects

- **Usage statistics.** Each opening of a book's page counts as a view of
  the book, and each opening of a chapter page as a view of the chapter
  ([Usage statistics](U64-usage-statistics.md), its Rule 1). Each
  opening of a file's view page, each "Download" there and each
  download from a file's link counts as a view of the file, a
  supplementary component's file (such as "Appendix") as a
  "Supplementary File" (the same Rule 1). <sup>q</sup>
- **"Manual Payment Notification"** (Rule 14). "Send notification of
  payment" emails the press's principal contact from the buyer's name and
  address, subject "Manual Payment Notification": "A manual payment needs
  to be processed for the press {press name} and the user {buyer's name}
  (username "{username}"). The item being paid for is "{file name}". The
  cost is {price} ({currency code}). This email was generated by the Open
  Monograph Press Manual Payment plugin." The price is written as typed
  in the file's terms ("The cost is 25 (USD)."), where the payment page
  shows "25.00 (USD)". Pressing it again sends it again. The email and
  its missing row in "Manage Emails" are [Payments &
  APCs](U52-payments-and-apcs.md)' (its Side effects). <sup>q</sup> <sup>td25</sup>
- **No other email, no notice.** Reading the pages, opening a file,
  reaching the payment page or downloading a citation sends no email and
  leaves no notice. <sup>q</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

1. **"PDF.js PDF Viewer"** (Settings › Website › "Plugins" › "Installed
   Plugins", "Generic Plugins"). On for a new press: a free PDF opens the PDF view page (Rule
   13). Off: its link downloads the file under its file name. <sup>r</sup>
2. **"HTML Monograph File"** (same list). On for a new press: a free HTML
   file opens the HTML view page. Off: its link downloads the file (Rule
   13; [Media files](U47-media-files.md), its Settings bullet 6). <sup>r</sup>
3. **"Citation Style Language"** (same list). Off for a new press: no
   "How to Cite" block. On: the block of Rule 19 on the book's page and
   the chapter pages, and the plugin row's "Settings" ([Article landing
   page & reading](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md), its Settings
   bullet 4). <sup>r</sup>
4. **The "Citation Style Language" "Settings" window** (bullet 3's
   "Settings"). On a new press: no primary format chosen (APA shown),
   every additional format and both download formats ticked, no
   publisher location. Each field's effect: [Article landing page &
   reading](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md), its Rule 16. <sup>m</sup>
5. **"Usage statistics display options"** (Settings › Website ›
   "Appearance" › "Theme", [Appearance &
   theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), its Rule 9). "Do not display
   submission usage statistics chart for reader." on a new press: no
   chart. A bar or line choice: the "Downloads" section of Rule 20.
   <sup>n</sup>
6. **"Users must be registered and log in to view open access content."**
   (Settings › Users & Roles › "Site Access Options", under "View
   Monograph Content"; unticked). Ticked: a visitor who presses a free
   file's link gets the Login page first, and once signed in there the
   file's view page (Actors row 3; Rule 13c); the pages themselves stay
   open. <sup>j</sup> <sup>r</sup>
7. **"Users must be registered and log in to view the press site."**
   (same tab; unticked). Ticked: a visitor who opens any address of this
   spec gets the Login page (Actors; [Journal identity & about
   pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md), its Rule 22). <sup>c</sup>
8. **"Enable this press to appear publicly on the site"** (Administration
   › Hosted Presses › the press's "Edit"; ticked on every press a test
   install creates). Unticked: a visitor gets the Login page (Actors).
   <sup>c</sup>
9. **"Currency" and "Payment Plugins"** (Settings › Distribution ›
   "Payments", [→ Payments tab](U52-payments-and-apcs.md#payments-tab);
   the tab shows these fields only while its "Enable" is ticked). A new
   press has no currency and "Manual Fee Payment" chosen without
   instructions. With a currency saved, a "Direct Sales" file's link
   shows its price (Rule 11a). With a currency and "Manual Payment
   Instructions" holding text, the link leads to the payment page; with
   "Paypal Fee Payment" and only its "Account Name", to a transaction
   error page (Rule 14). Without instructions or an "Account Name", a
   signed-in buyer is sent to the catalog page (Rule 14a). <sup>k</sup>
10. **"Enable"** (the same tab; unticked on a new press). Neither end
    changes these pages (Rule 14b) [A12](#a12). <sup>k</sup>
11. **"Publication Dates"** (per book: the editorial view's "Marketing" ›
    "Publication Dates", [Chapters & work
    type](U72-chapters-work-type.md), its Settings bullet 1). Neither
    option saved on a new book, which works as "All chapters will use
    the publication date of the monograph.": a chapter page shows the
    version's date. "Each chapter may have its own publication date.":
    the chapter's own date when it has one (Rule 16). <sup>l</sup>
12. **"Chapter Page"** (per chapter: its window's "Show this chapter on
    its own page and link to that page from the book's table of
    contents.", [Chapters & work type](U72-chapters-work-type.md), its
    Rule 10). Unticked on a new chapter: the title is plain text and the
    chapter has no page. Ticked, or the chapter has a DOI: the title
    links to its page (Rules 10, 15). On a chapter with a DOI the box
    stays enabled under "(This chapter will always be shown on its own
    page because it has a DOI.)"; unticked and saved, it reopens ticked
    and the chapter keeps its page and link. <sup>l</sup>
13. **"Date" and "Date (Short)"** (Settings › Website › "Setup" › "Date &
    Time", [Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), its
    Rule 31). The long format writes the date lines (Rules 8, 16), the
    short one the "Versions" lists and the book page's notices (Rules 6,
    9); any short format but the year-first one a new press has can
    head a published chapter "Forthcoming" and a scheduled one
    "Published" (Rule 16a) [A13](#a13). <sup>h</sup>
14. **Settings other features describe.** The work type, whose Edited
    Volume credits its volume editors
    ([Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md#omp2));
    the DOI settings for monographs, chapters and publication formats
    ([DOIs](U45-dois.md)); the URN plugin
    ([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)); the press's and the version's
    license ([Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md)) and the
    cover sizes ([Catalog management](U70-catalog-management.md)) each
    add, gate or shape a part of these pages; their rules are there. Two
    such settings change nothing here: a format's "Publisher ID" shows
    nowhere on these pages ([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md), its Rule
    21), and a contributor with "Include this contributor when
    identifying authors in lists of publications." unticked is still
    credited on the book's page, while the catalog's listing leaves them
    out ([Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md),
    its Rule 8). <sup>d</sup>
15. **"DOI Versioning"** (Settings › Distribution › "DOIs" › "Setup",
    [DOIs](U45-dois.md), its Rules 11 and 12). "No" (the default): an
    older version's chapter page, and a new version's (Rule 5b), shows a
    server error page [A19](#a19). "Yes": an older version's chapter page
    opens (Rules 15a, 17, 18); a new version's is untried. <sup>l</sup>
16. **"Publicly Show Reviewer Comments"** (Settings › Workflow › Review ›
    "Setup", the box "Make reviewer comments publicly visible with
    published content"; [Review setup & review
    forms](U29-review-setup-and-review-forms.md), its Rule 4). Unticked on
    a new press. Ticked: every new review request arrives with its own
    "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" ticked. At either end the book's
    page shows no review (Rule 22) [A26](#a26). <sup>t</sup>

Scenarios 1 to 9 read books published for them on scratch presses with
throwaway accounts, because the seeded press's catalog holds what earlier
runs published, and scenario 10 runs on a scratch journal and a scratch
preprint server. The accounts, their passwords, the mail catcher and the
tooling recipe are in the footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **A published book's page**

   Given: a visitor, on a scratch press, and its published Monograph
   "Shorelines", subtitle "Essays on the Coast", URL Path "shorelines",
   by Ada Quill and Lee Marsh, with an abstract, the keywords alpha and
   beta gamma, a plain language summary, the series "Monographs", the
   category "History", the date 2024-03-05, no chapter, and three
   approved, available formats: "PDF" holding article.pdf on "Open
   Access", "Online" at the remote address https://example.org/shorelines,
   and the physical "Paperback", with no file, the "ISBN-13 (15)" code
   978-951-98548-9-2, a "Publication date (01)" of 20240305 in the "Date
   Format" its window preselects, a width of 130 and a height of 200.

   - **The address**: open the press's address followed by
     "catalog/book/shorelines": the book's page opens under the press's
     header, with no trail ("Home / …") above the title, and the browser
     tab reads "Shorelines: Essays on the Coast | {press name}" (Rule 2;
     Fields, the book's page).
   - **The main column**: top to bottom, with no notice above them: the
     heading "Shorelines" with "Essays on the Coast"; Ada Quill and Lee
     Marsh; "Keywords:" followed by alpha and beta gamma joined by a
     comma, in either order; "Synopsis" over the abstract; "Plain
     Language Summary" over the summary; and the "References" heading
     with nothing under it. There is no "Downloads" chart, the press
     being on "Do not display submission usage statistics chart for
     reader." (Fields, the book's page; Rule 7; Settings bullet 5).
   - **The side column**: top to bottom: the press's default book
     picture, not a link; the links "PDF" and "Online", in either order,
     and none for "Paperback", which holds no file; "Published" with
     "March 5, 2024"; "Versions" with "2024-03-05 (Version of Record
     1.0)" as plain text; "Series" with "Monographs", a link to the
     series' page; "Categories" with "History", a link to the category's
     page; a copyright line; and "Paperback"'s details. There is no "How
     to Cite", the "Citation Style Language" plugin being off on a new
     press (Fields, the book's page; Rules 8, 9, 11; Settings bullet 3).
   - **"Paperback"'s details**: the block is headed "Paperback", the
     book having more than one available format, and holds "ISBN-13
     (15)" with 978-951-98548-9-2 under it, "Publication date (01)" with
     2024-03-05 and "Hijri Calendar" under it, and "Physical Dimensions"
     with 130 and 200, each followed by its unit, joined by " x ". "PDF"
     and "Online" have no block (Rule 12).
   - **"Online"**: press it: https://example.org/shorelines opens in a
     new tab (Rule 11).
   - **"PDF"'s address**: the link's address is the press's address
     followed by "catalog/view/shorelines/", then the format's and the
     file's numbers (Rules 2, 11c).
   - **The number address**: open the press's address followed by
     "catalog/book/" and the book's number: the same page opens, and the
     address stays as typed (Rule 2).
   - **Control**: a second published book of the press, "Bare", with
     only a title, the contributor Ada Quill and an abstract, shows the
     title, Ada Quill, "Synopsis", the "References" heading with nothing
     under it, the default book picture, "Published", "Versions" and the
     copyright line "Copyright (c) {year} {press name}", and no other
     heading (Rule 7). <sup>s</sup>

2. **The table of contents, a chapter's page and the "Downloads" chart**

   Given: a visitor, on a scratch press that gives chapters DOIs and
   shows the downloads chart as bars, and two of its books, published
   on 2024-03-05 and both by Ada Quill and Lee Marsh: "Coastlines", its
   "Publication Dates" left as a new book has it, with the formats
   "PDF" holding article.pdf and "Chapter PDF" holding replacement.pdf,
   both on "Open Access", and the chapters "Tides", subtitle "Low and
   high", by Lee Marsh, with its page, a DOI, the synopsis "How the sea
   rises and falls.", the pages 1-20 and replacement.pdf, then
   "Harbours", with no author, no page and no DOI; and "Reef Notes", on
   "Each chapter may have its own publication date.", with the chapters
   "Reef", its "Date Published" 2024-06-01, and "Lagoon", with no date
   of its own, both with their pages.

   - **The table of contents**: open "Coastlines"' page: the main column
     lists the chapters in the order they were added: "Tides" with "Low
     and high", a link, followed by "Lee Marsh", by "DOI:
     https://doi.org/" and the chapter's DOI as a link, and by a link
     "Chapter PDF"; then "Harbours" as plain text (Rule 10).
   - **The side column's files**: they list "PDF" and no "Chapter PDF",
     a file a chapter holds being listed under that chapter only
     (Rule 11).
   - **"Downloads"**: the main column holds a section headed "Downloads"
     with a bar chart of the book's downloads by month, over the last
     twelve months (Rules 20, 20a).
   - **"Tides"' page**: press "Tides": the address is "Coastlines"'
     address followed by "/chapter/" and the chapter's number, and the
     browser tab reads "Tides: Low and high | {press name}". The main
     column holds, with no notice above them, the heading "Tides" with
     "Low and high", Lee Marsh, "DOI:" with the chapter's DOI as a link,
     and "Synopsis" over "How the sea rises and falls."; the side column
     holds the default book picture as a link to the book's page, the
     link "Chapter PDF" and no other file, "Volume" with "Coastlines" as
     a link, "Pages" with 1-20, and "Published" with "March 5, 2024",
     the version's date, and no "Versions". The page has no "Downloads"
     chart (Fields, the
     chapter page; Rules 15, 16, 17, 20; Settings bullet 11).
   - **"Volume"**: press "Coastlines" under "Volume": "Coastlines"' page
     opens (Rule 18).
   - **Chapters with their own dates**: open "Reef Notes"' page and
     press "Reef": its "Published" reads "June 1, 2024". Back on the
     book's page, press "Lagoon": its "Published" reads "March 5, 2024",
     the version's date (Rule 16; Settings bullet 11).
   - **Control**: "Coastlines"' address followed by "/chapter/" and
     the number the tooling reports for "Harbours" opens the "404 Not
     Found" page (Rule 15). <sup>s</sup>

3. **Opening a free PDF and a free HTML file**

   Given: a visitor, on a scratch press, and its published book
   "Shorelines" with the formats "PDF" holding article.pdf and "HTML"
   holding article.html, both on "Open Access".

   - **"PDF"**: on the book's page press "PDF": the PDF view page opens
     without the press's header, footer or sidebar, its browser tab
     reading "PDF view of the file article.pdf". The bar across the top
     holds, left to right, an arrow with no visible text, which a screen
     reader reads "Return to view details about Shorelines", article.pdf
     as plain text, and "Download", which a screen reader reads
     "Download Download PDF". The PDF viewer fills the page under the
     bar and shows article.pdf, its toolbar reading "of 1". Press
     "Download": the browser saves article.pdf and the page stays as it
     is; the viewer's own download button saves article.pdf too
     (Rule 13; Fields, the PDF view page).
   - **The return arrow**: press it: the book's page opens (Fields, the
     PDF view page).
   - **"HTML"**: press "HTML": the HTML view page opens without the
     press's header, footer or sidebar, its browser tab reading "HTML
     view of the file article.html". Its bar holds only a return arrow,
     whose name for a screen reader is [A10](#a10), neither a pass nor
     a fail here, and "Shorelines" as a link, with no "Download"; under
     the bar the HTML file's text fills the page (Rule 13; Fields, the
     HTML view page).
   - **The title**: press "Shorelines": the book's page opens (Fields,
     the HTML view page).
   - **Control**: the mail catcher holds no email after the two files
     were opened (Side effects, "No other email, no notice").
     <sup>s</sup>

4. **A file for sale bought with "Manual Fee Payment"**

   Given: a Reader and a visitor, on a scratch press that sells in US
   dollars with "Manual Fee Payment" and its "Manual Payment
   Instructions" filled, and its published book "Shorelines" with the
   format "PDF" holding article.pdf on "Direct Sales" at a price typed
   as 25.

   - **The link**: signed out, open the book's page: article.pdf's link
     reads "Purchase PDF (25 USD)" after the price; the bare price
     before it is [A7](#a7), neither a pass nor a fail here (Rule 11a).
   - **The payment page**: Reader: sign in, open the book's page and
     press the link: the payment page opens with the press's header and
     footer and the trail "Home / Manual Fee Payment", headed "Manual
     Fee Payment", with "Title" article.pdf and "Fee" "25.00 (USD)". The
     mail catcher holds no email yet (Rule 14; Fields, the payment page;
     Side effects, "No other email, no notice").
   - **"Send notification of payment"**: press it: the page shows
     "Payment Notification" with "Payment notification sent" and
     "Continue" (Rule 14).
   - **The press's principal contact**: the mail catcher holds one email
     to the principal contact, from the Reader's name and address,
     subject "Manual Payment Notification", reading "A manual payment
     needs to be processed for the press {press name} and the user
     {Reader's name} (username "{Reader's username}"). The item being
     paid for is "article.pdf". The cost is 25 (USD). This email was
     generated by the Open Monograph Press Manual Payment plugin." (Actors
     row 5; Side effects, "Manual Payment Notification").
   - **"Continue"**: press it: the payment page opens again, with "Fee"
     "25.00 (USD)" (Rule 14).
   - **Control**: the Reader signs out and presses the link again: the
     Login page opens, not the payment page, and where signing in there
     lands is [A18](#a18), neither a pass nor a fail here (Actors row 4;
     Rule 14). <sup>s</sup>

5. **An unpublished book: the preview, and "404 Not Found" for everyone else**

   Given: Press manager, the Author, a Reader, an External Reviewer,
   another Author of the press who is not on the book, and a visitor,
   on a scratch press with the Author's book "Draft Tides" in
   Production, never published and with no date saved, the Author's
   second submission left unfinished in the wizard, and the published
   book "Shorelines".

   - **The Press manager's preview**: Press manager: open "Draft Tides"'
     workflow and press "Preview" in its header: the book's page opens
     under the notice "This is a preview and has not been published.
     View submission", with no "Published" line and no "Versions" list
     (Actors row 2; Rule 5).
   - **"View submission"**: press it: "Draft Tides"' workflow opens
     (Rule 5a).
   - **The Author**: Author: type the book's address, the press's
     address followed by "catalog/book/" and the book's number: the page
     opens under the same notice (Actors row 2).
   - **Everyone else**: the visitor, signed out, then the Reader, the
     External Reviewer and the other Author, each signed in in turn,
     open the same address: each gets the "404 Not Found" page (Actors
     row 2; Rule 3).
   - **The unfinished submission**: its address, the press's address
     followed by "catalog/book/" and its number, opens the "404 Not
     Found" page for the Press manager and for the Author (Actors row 2).
   - **Control**: the visitor opens "Shorelines"' page, which shows no
     preview notice (Rules 3, 5). <sup>s</sup>

6. **An older version beside the current one**

   Given: a visitor, on a scratch press, and its book first published on
   2024-03-05 as "Tides" (Version of Record 1.0), then published again
   today as a second version retitled "Tides Revised".

   - **The current page**: open the book's address: it is headed "Tides
     Revised"; "Published" reads "March 5, 2024 — Updated on {today}",
     {today} being today's date written like the first; "Versions"
     lists, newest first, the second version as today's date written
     year-month-day and its version name in brackets, in plain text, and
     "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)" as a link (Rules 4, 8, 9).
   - **The older version**: press "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)":
     the address is the book's address followed by "/version/" and an
     id; the page opens under "This is an outdated version published on
     2024-03-05. Read the most recent version." and is headed "Tides",
     while which title its browser tab names is [A5](#a5), neither a
     pass nor a fail here; "Published" reads "March 5, 2024"; in
     "Versions" the first version is plain text and the second a link to
     the book's address (Rules 4, 6, 8, 9).
   - **"most recent version"**: press it: the book's address opens,
     headed "Tides Revised" (Rule 6).
   - **Control**: the current version's page carries no outdated-version
     notice (Rule 6). <sup>s</sup>

7. **An older version's chapter pages, on a press with "DOI Versioning" "Yes"**

   Given: a visitor, on a scratch press whose "DOI Versioning" reads
   "Yes", and its book "Coastlines", first published on 2024-03-05 with
   the chapters "Tides" and "Coda", then published again today as a
   second version from which "Coda" was removed and to which "Harbours"
   was added, every chapter with its page.

   - **"Tides" now**: open the book's page and press "Tides": its
     "Versions" lists, newest first, the second version, today's date
     written year-month-day and its version name in brackets, as plain
     text, and "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)" as a link (Rule 17).
   - **"Tides" in the first version**: press "2024-03-05 (Version of
     Record 1.0)": the address is the book's address followed by
     "/version/", an id, "/chapter/" and the same chapter number as
     before, and the page opens under "This is an outdated version
     published on {date}. Read the most recent version.", {date} being
     the first version's. Press "Coastlines" under "Volume": the first
     version's book page opens, under its own outdated-version notice.
     Go back and press "most recent version": "Tides"' current page
     opens (Rules 15, 15a, 18).

     version, today's date written year-month-day and its version name
     in brackets, followed by " — Without this chapter", as plain text,
     and "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)" as plain text. Press "most
     recent version": the book's current page opens (Rules 10, 17, 18).
   - **Control**: the book's address followed by "/chapter/" and
     "Coda"'s number opens the "404 Not Found" page, the current version
     not carrying "Coda" (Rule 15). <sup>s</sup>

8. **"How to Cite" on a book and a chapter**

   Given: a visitor, on a scratch press with the "Citation Style
   Language" plugin on and DOIs switched off, and its published
   Monograph "Shorelines" by Ada Quill and Lee Marsh, dated 2024-03-05,
   in no series, with the chapter "Tides" by Lee Marsh, on the pages
   1-20, with its page.

     with "How to Cite", citing the book in "APA" with the authors Quill
     and Marsh, the title "Shorelines", the press's name as publisher,
     the version's date and the book's address, the press's address
     followed by "catalog/book/" and the book's number (Rules 19, 19a;
     Settings bullet 4).
   - **Another format**: choose "MLA" among the block's other formats
     ([→ How to Cite](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md#how-to-cite)):
     the citation's text changes, still naming Quill, Marsh and
     "Shorelines" (Actors row 6; Rule 19).
   - **A download**: choose the "BibTeX" download in the same list: the
     browser saves a file (Actors row 6; Rule 19).
   - **The chapter's citation**: press "Tides" in the table of contents:
     the chapter page's side column ends with "How to Cite", citing
     Marsh, "Tides", "In" Quill and Marsh, "Shorelines", the pages 1-20,
     the press's name and the chapter's address, the book's address
     followed by "/chapter/" and the chapter's number (Rule 19b).

     PDF view page with no Login page (Actors row 3). <sup>s</sup>

10. **No book's page on a journal or a preprint server** {OJS OPS}

    Given: a visitor, on a scratch journal that requires subscriptions
    and charges 5 US dollars for "Purchase Article", with an article
    carrying the galley "PDF" published in the journal's one published
    issue, whose "Access status" is "Subscription", and on a scratch
    preprint server with a posted preprint carrying the galley "PDF".

    - **The journal**: open the journal's address followed by
      "catalog/book/" and the article's number: the "404 Not Found" page
      opens. The article's page lists its galley, whose link reads
      "Requires Subscription or Fee PDF (USD 5)", and no table of
      contents (Purpose, the absence paragraph).
    - **The preprint server**: open the server's address followed by
      "catalog/book/" and the preprint's number: the "404 Not Found" page
      opens. The preprint's page lists its galley "PDF", with no price,
      and no table of contents (Purpose, the absence paragraph).

      "catalog/book/" and a published book's number opens the book's
      page (Rule 2). <sup>s</sup>

**A1 — On a press, a book address that names no book opens the Login page instead of "404 Not Found"** · 🐞 · low.
On a press, a visitor who opens a book address with a number or URL
Path the press does not have is sent to the Login page. A visitor who
signs in there, like anyone already signed in, gets an error page
instead: its heading is empty, its browser tab reads "| {press name}",
and its text is "An invalid published submission was specified.". In
both cases the answer should be "404 Not Found".
Nothing is lost, since there is no book to show. But a mistyped or
stale link asks the visitor to sign in for something that does not
exist, and a crawler is redirected instead of being told the address
is gone.
The press already answers "404 Not Found" in the neighbouring case, an
unpublished book's address opened by a visitor. A journal and a
preprint server answer "404 Not Found" for this case, an article or
preprint address that names nothing.

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — A book published only as an Author Original has no page** · ❓ · minor.
A book whose only published version is an "Author Original" answers "404
Not Found" to readers, and the catalog leaves it out, although the
workflow shows that version "Status: Published". The Press manager and
the Site Administrator who type the book's address get its page as if
published, with no preview notice, "Published {Version of Record date} —
Updated on {Author Original date}" and "Versions" "{date} (Author
Original 1.0)"; the workflow, which shows the Version of Record "Status:
Unpublished", offers them neither "View" nor "Preview".
Question: should a published Author Original make the book public on a
press? Lean: intended; only a Version of Record puts a book in the catalog,
but the workflow could say so.

such as "abc") shows a blank server error page instead of "404 Not
Found", to visitors, Readers, the Press manager and the Site
Administrator alike: the app fails.

**A4 — A new version's preview also calls itself outdated** · 🐞 · low.
Previewing a new, unpublished version of a published book shows the
preview notice and, under it, "This is an outdated version published on
{today's date}. Read the most recent version." While the version has no
publication date the line prints the day of the preview, and once a
"Date Published" is saved on the version's "Catalog Entry" it prints
that date. The version is the newest there is, and "most recent
version" leads to the published version's page. A journal's preview
page shows the preview notice alone. The editor or author checking the
new version is told it is outdated and already published; readers never
see the line.

**A5 — An older version's browser tab names the current version** · 🐞 · low.
An older version's page is headed with that version's title, but its
browser tab (and a bookmark made from it) reads the current version's
title. A reader who bookmarks the version they cite gets a bookmark
named after another version. The fault shows only when a later version
was published under a different title.

**A6 — A book's table of contents repeats the book's authors under every chapter** · 🐞 · low.
A book's page names the book's authors at the top, and its table of
contents is meant to show a chapter's author line only when the
chapter's authors differ from the book's. The chapter's author line is
shown also where the chapter's authors are the book's: a book by one
author lists that author again under each of its chapters, and a book by
several authors lists them all again under a chapter credited to all of
them.
The names shown are correct; the repeated lines only add noise to the
table of contents.
On `main` no setting avoids it. On 3.5 and earlier the lines are left
out once the "Author" role's "Show role title in contributor list" box
(Settings › Users & Roles › Roles) is unticked; it is ticked on a new
press.

bare price, then the sentence with the price again.

**A8 — In a format with several files, a file for sale shows no price** · 🐞 · low.
A format with more than one listed file shows each file's name twice, as
text and as a link, and the link of a file for sale reads only its name:
no price and no "Purchase". The reader cannot tell it from a free file
until the link leads to the Login or payment page.

**A10 — On a press, the return arrow of a book's HTML view page is announced as the code "##monograph.return##"** · 🐞 · low.
The return arrow at the top left of a book's HTML view page has no
visible text, and a screen reader announces it as the code
"##monograph.return##". On the PDF view page the same arrow is
announced "Return to view details about" and the book's title.
A blind reader cannot tell where the arrow leads. The arrow works and
opens the book's page, and the link beside it, read out as the book's
title, opens the same page. The arrow has no hover tooltip, so sighted
readers never see the code.
The code is announced on every HTML book file, in every language the
press offers, English included. The page is the one the "HTML Monograph
File" plugin shows, and the plugin is on by default.

**A11 — A buyer who pays by hand never gets the file** · ❓ · user-visible.
With "Manual Fee Payment", a buyer's "Send notification of payment" emails
the press, and "Continue" leads back to the payment page. A press has no
list of payments, and no menu leads to one.
No screen records a manual payment, so the file stays for sale to that buyer however they paid.
Question: should a press be able to record a manual payment, or should
"Manual Fee Payment" be withheld from direct sales? Lean: record it; the
method's own description says the manager records receipt.

**A12 — A press that unticks "Enable" on its Payments tab still sells its priced files** · 🐞 · low.
A press that sells book files unticks "Enable" on Settings ›
Distribution › "Payments" and saves, expecting payments to stop. The
tab then hides the currency and the payment method, as if payments
were off. A signed-in reader who opens a priced file's link still gets
the payment page with the fee and the press's payment instructions.
The press is not told that the box changed nothing. A buyer is treated
exactly as before the box was unticked, so nobody pays without getting
what a buyer got before. To stop selling, the press must change each
priced file's terms.
The fault shows on a press that has a currency, a payment method and a
file set to "Direct Sales". On a journal the same box does turn
payments off.

**A13 — On a press whose short date format is not year-first, a published chapter's page is headed "Forthcoming"** · 🐞 · low.
On a press that has changed its "Date (Short)" setting, a published
chapter's page can be headed "Forthcoming" above its publication date:
a chapter of a book published on December 31, 2024 reads "Forthcoming
December 31, 2024". The book's own page reads "Published".
The other way round, a chapter of a book scheduled for a later date can
read "Published" in an editor's preview while the book's page reads
"Forthcoming".
Only the heading is wrong, and whether it is wrong changes with the day
the page is read: on part of each month under a day-first format, on
part of each year under the month-first one, depending on the day or
month the book was published.
It needs a chapter with its own page. The year-first format, which a
press has until someone changes the setting, is not affected; the three
other choices the setting offers (day-month-year, month/day/year,
day.month.year) are.

On a later version of a book, a chapter's "APA" citation adds "(Original

version added: "Harbours", added in 2026, is cited "(2026). Harbours. …

**A15 — In French (Canada), a book's purchase link drops the format's name, and the "Format Availability" window is titled "Approbation du format"** · 🐞 · low.
On a press shown in French (Canada), two texts say something other than
their English. A reader who opens a book with a file for sale sees the
purchase link without the format's name: "25.00 Achat (25.00 USD)",
where the English page reads "25.00 Purchase PDF (25.00 USD)". An
editor who presses a format's availability link on the book's
"Publication Formats" page gets a window titled "Approbation du format"
("Format Approval"), where English titles it "Format Availability".

Nothing is lost and both tasks get done: the link still opens the
purchase, and the window's own sentence says that the format will be
available to readers. For a format with a single file the link is the
only place the book's page names the format, so the French reader is
not told which format the price buys. The press cannot change either
text from its settings.

A press shows both when "Français (Canada)" is among the languages it
offers; the link also needs payments turned on and a file priced for
direct sale. "Français" (France) has the same purchase link, and the
right window title.
Every version name reads "{date} (##publication.versionStage.display##)", as on an article's page ([→ Article landing page & reading, A1](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md#a1)), whose report covers it.

An editor who previews an unpublished book sees "This is a preview and
has not been published. View submission" at the top of the book's page.
A chapter's page opened from that preview shows no such notice, and so
no link back to the submission.
When the book carries a date, the chapter's page also reads "Published
{date}" or "Forthcoming {date}", as the book's page does, so it looks
like a public page. A book carries a date when it was published and
then unpublished, or is scheduled, or its "Date Published" was typed in
"Catalog Entry".
Readers are not affected: to them the address answers "404 Not Found".

**A18 — A visitor who signs in or registers to buy a book file lands on their home page, not the payment page** · 🐞 · low.
A visitor who follows the link of a book file for sale gets the Login
page. After signing in there they expect the payment page for that
file. They land where an ordinary sign-in would take them: the press's
home page, "My Submissions" or the Dashboard, by role. A newcomer who
chooses "Register" on that Login page, fills the form and sends it
lands on "Registration complete", signed in.
The Login page and the page they land on say nothing of the purchase.
The buyer, now signed in, must find the book again and follow the
file's link a second time, which opens the payment page at once.
The fault shows on a press that sells files: a currency and a payment
method under Settings › Distribution › "Payments", and a file set to
"Direct Sales".

**A19 — An older version's chapter page of a book shows a blank server error page to every reader** · 🐞 · medium · crash: server.
The server fails when a reader opens a chapter's page in an older
version of a book. Instead of the chapter under the "This is an outdated
version" notice, the reader gets a blank server error page. All three
ways in fail: the address typed, the chapter's link in the older
version's table of contents, and the older version's link in the chapter
page's "Versions" list.
Editors meet the same page in the preview of a book's second or later
version before it is published: each chapter's link in the preview's
table of contents fails. The preview of a book's first version, and
every book page, still open, and so do the current version's chapter
pages.
It needs three things, for both pages, and the first is the default:
- the press's "DOI Versioning" reads "No", as it does until someone
  changes it;
- the chapter has its own page ("Chapter Page" is a tick on each
  chapter);
- the chapter has no DOI in the version shown, which is every chapter
  of a press that assigns no chapter DOIs. A new version's chapter
  carries the DOI its chapter had when the version was made.
A chapter DOI assigned later saves only one of the two pages. Assigned
between "Create New Version" and "Publish", it goes to the published
version's chapter: that version's page opens once it is the older one,
but the preview still fails. Assigned after "Publish", it goes to the
new version's chapter, and the older version's page still fails.

On a book whose chapters carry their own publication dates, a chapter's
page in a later version of the book gives the same date twice: "June 1,
2024 — Updated on June 1, 2024". A reader is told the chapter was
updated on the day it was first published.
A new version copies each chapter with its "Date Published", and the
page prints the chapter's first date and its date in this version
whether or not they differ. The line stays that way until an editor
types another date into the chapter.
It needs a book set to "Each chapter may have its own publication
date.", which is a choice made per book and not what a new book has, a
chapter with its own page and date, and a second published version.

**A21 — On a preview, "How to Cite" works only for the roles assigned to the book** · ❓ · minor.
On an unpublished book's preview, the book's Author and a Series editor
or assistant role not assigned to the book see the citation, but
choosing another format leaves it unchanged and a download opens the
"404 Not Found" page. The Press manager and the roles assigned to the
book get the other format and the file.
Question: should everyone who may preview a book use its citation
formats? Lean: yes, a defect; the block is offered to them, as on an
article's page ([→ Article landing page & reading, OJS1](U13-article-landing-page-and-reading.md#ojs1)).

**A22 — "APA" prints a series position as a number of volumes** · ❓ · minor.
A book at position 3 of its series is cited in "APA" as "Tides (Vols.
3)", which reads as a work in three volumes, and its chapters as "(Vols.
3, pp. 1-20)"; the series' title shows only in the "BibTeX" and "RIS"
files.
Question: should "APA" print a series position as one? Lean: yes, a
defect; a place in a series is not a count of volumes.

**A23 — A press's PDF view page fails in its own script, "PDFJS is not defined", every time it opens** · 🐞 · low · crash: script.
Each time a reader opens a book's PDF on a press, the PDF view page's
own script fails: the browser's console reads "PDFJS is not defined".
The reader sees nothing of it: the viewer under the bar shows the PDF
and "Download" saves it all the same.
The page also loads and runs the PDF viewer's two scripts a second
time outside the viewer, where nothing uses them. Nothing is lost; the
error is noise for anyone watching a press's pages for script
failures.
It happens on every PDF view page while "PDF.js PDF Viewer" is on, as
it is on a new press.

**A24 — On a preview, every file link of the book opens "404 Not Found"** · 🐞 · minor.
A preview of an unpublished book, or of a new version of a published
one, lists the version's files as the published page will. Pressing any
of them, "PDF" or "HTML", opens the "404 Not Found" page instead of the
file's view page, for everyone who may open the preview, the Press
manager, the Site Administrator and the book's Author included. Whoever
checks a version before publishing it cannot read its files from the
page that previews it.

**A25 — A book's HTML file that links another book shows with every "omp://" link dead** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A book's HTML file holding a link written "omp://monograph/{number}",
the "HTML Monograph File" plugin's shorthand for another book of the
press, opens in the HTML view page and its text shows, but its links
written "omp://…", that one and any "omp://press" link in the same
file, keep their written address: pressing one does nothing. A
visitor, a Reader and the Press manager get the same. The reader cannot
follow the file's links to the other book or to the press. A file
whose only such link is written "omp://press" shows, with that link
opening the press's home page.

**A26 — A review made public never shows on the published book's page** · 🐞 · user-visible.
The Press manager ticks "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" on an "Open"
review and presses "Mark as Complete", whose dialog says "This review
will be made publicly visible alongside the article." Once the book is
published, its page shows no review at all: no comments, no reviewer's
name, no review heading, for a visitor, a Reader or the Press manager.
The press believes its reviews are public, and nobody learns that
readers never see them. No setting puts the review on the page, and a
press that makes every new review public under Settings › Workflow ›
Review › "Setup" gets the same.

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — OMP `pages/catalog/CatalogBookHandler.php` (ops `book`, `view`, `download`) renders `templates/frontend/pages/book.tpl`, which includes `frontend/objects/monograph_full.tpl` (the book) or `frontend/objects/chapter.tpl` (`$isChapterRequest`). Files: `frontend/components/publicationFormats.tpl` and `downloadLink.tpl`; contributors: `frontend/components/authors.tpl`. Viewers: `plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer` (hooks `CatalogBookHandler::view`, `::download`, late) and `plugins/generic/htmlMonographFile` (the same hooks). How to cite: `plugins/generic/citationStyleLanguage` on `CatalogBookHandler::book`, `Templates::Catalog::Book::Details`, `Templates::Catalog::Chapter::Details`. Purchase: the fall-through of `CatalogBookHandler::download()` into `OMPPaymentManager`, and `pages/payment/PaymentHandler::plugin()` for a method's callback. Code read on checkout omp `3cd59e944` (lib/pkp `17a1f01fed`), 2026-09-28. The OMP default theme overrides none of these templates. ui-library's `PkpCite` is mounted by no template (UNASSIGNED item 30 records it for the article page); the legacy CSL block is the only one. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Purpose): on scratch presses the home page's two lists, the catalog, a series page, a category page, "New Releases" and a search each lead to the book; the book's page, a chapter page, both view pages and the payment page as the sections above describe.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — OJS and OPS `pages/catalog/index.php` route only `category`, `fullSize` and `thumbnail` to `CatalogHandler`; neither app has `CatalogBookHandler`, `pages/payment` exists in OJS only (its own payment types), OPS has no payment code. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (the absence paragraph): on a scratch journal requiring subscriptions with a "Purchase Article" fee of 5 USD, an article published in its one published issue showed a galley link reading "Requires Subscription or Fee PDF (USD 5)"; pressed signed out it led to Login ("Subscription or article purchase required to access item."), pressed by a Reader to "Manual Fee Payment" ("Fee" "5.00 (USD)"). A scratch server's preprint page showed its galleys, no table of contents, no chapter pages and nothing for sale.

<a id="fn-td1"></a>
**td1** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (the absence paragraph): on the seeded journal and preprint server, `catalog/book/1`, `catalog/book/1/chapter/1`, `catalog/view/1/1/1`, `catalog/download/1/1/1` and `catalog/book/{a published item's number}` answered "404 Not Found", signed out and as the Journal Manager (Server Manager). Control: on the seeded press `catalog/book/1` sent a visitor to Login and gave the Press manager "An invalid published submission was specified." (Rule 3a).

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — `CatalogBookHandler::authorize()` adds `ContextRequiredPolicy` and `OmpPublishedSubmissionAccessPolicy` (whose `OmpPublishedSubmissionRequiredPolicy` resolves the number or URL Path and checks nothing about status); `PKPHandler::authorize()` adds `RestrictedSiteAccessPolicy` for `restrictSiteAccess` and a press not enabled. `book()` throws not found when the submission is not `STATUS_PUBLISHED` and the user is absent or `Repo::submission()->canPreview()` is false; `canPreview()` passes any user holding `ROLE_ID_MANAGER`, `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT` or `ROLE_ID_SUBSCRIPTION_MANAGER` in the press (`_roleCanPreview()`, assignment not read) and any user with an Author stage assignment on the book; an incomplete submission is never previewable. Role names from OMP `locale/en/default.po` and lib/pkp `locale/en/default.po`. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Actors preamble, rows 1, 7, 8; Settings bullets 7, 8): a published book's page and its chapter page read the same for a visitor and 23 signed-in accounts (every role of a new press, assigned and not, the book's Author, both kinds of Reviewer, the Site Administrator). Settings › Users & Roles › "Roles" on a new press listed 19 roles, eight of them at "Assistant", the eight the preamble names. On a press requiring sign-in, and on one created not enabled, a signed-out visitor who opened the book, a version, a chapter page, a file's view or download address, a priced file or the press home landed on Login; that press's signed-in Reader read the pages. "Enable this press to appear publicly on the site" sits only in the Site Administrator's Hosted Presses › "Edit" window (the journal's and server's box likewise).

<a id="fn-td5"></a>
**td5** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Actors row 2; Rule 5): on scratch presses with an unpublished book in Production, the book's page opened under the preview notice for the Press manager, Press editor, Production editor, an assigned and an unassigned Series editor, an assigned and an unassigned Copyeditor, the other seven assistant roles (unassigned), the book's Author and the Site Administrator. A visitor, a Reader, an External and an Internal Reviewer, and another Author, a Volume editor, a Chapter Author and a Translator not on the book got "404 Not Found"; a submission its author never finished answered "404 Not Found" to every role. The workflow offered "Preview" to the Press manager and the assigned Series editor, and the book's Author neither "Preview" nor "View". The book's chapter page opened for every previewing role without a notice, reading "Published March 5, 2024" (A17).

No template of the page includes `breadcrumbs.tpl`. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Fields intro, the book's page): tabs "K2 Minimal Book | {press name}" and, with a subtitle, "K2 Full Book: A Subtitle | {press name}"; the two columns side by side at 1280 px; the parts in the tables' order; the view pages without header, footer or sidebar, the payment page with them and the trail "Home / Manual Fee Payment". Keywords typed "alpha", "beta gamma" (stored in that order) read "alpha, beta gamma" in three runs and "beta gamma, alpha" in one. A format with no code, date, identifier or physical box got no details block. Settings bullet 14: a format's Publisher ID "pid-k3", saved and read back, appeared nowhere in the book page's HTML; a contributor unticked from "Include this contributor when identifying authors in lists of publications." on a new version was still listed under "Authors", while the catalog's line named only the other author; an Edited Volume's new version credited its volume editor "(ed)"; a press license saved on screen showed on a book published after it and not on one published before; a 400 × 400 cover showed as a 100 × 100 copy.

<a id="fn-td24"></a>
**td24** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 7; Fields, Cover): the bare book showed the screen-reader "Authors" heading, "Synopsis", an empty "References", the default book picture (not a link, empty alternate text), "Published", "Versions" and "Copyright (c) 2024 {press name}", and no other heading. A cover saved with "Alternate text" showed its small copy with that text, not a link.

Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Fields, the chapter page): tab "Tides: Low and high | {press name}"; the parts in the tables' order; an Edited Volume's chapter listed its own authors; "Pages 1-20"; the chapter's own "License URL" as a Creative Commons badge, an unknown one as a link reading "License"; the cover and "Volume" linked `…/catalog/book/{number}` (older version `…/version/{id}`), a number even with a URL Path saved. On a book with no cover the cover link had no name for a screen reader, seen in one run; what it reads with a cover is not settled.

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — OMP `plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer/templates/display.tpl`: `<title>` `catalog.viewableFile.title` "{$type} view of the file {$title}" (format name, file name); `.return` link to `catalog/book/{bestId}` with screen-reader text `catalog.viewableFile.return` "Return to view details about {$monographTitle}"; `.title` a plain `span` with the file's name (OJS's template links the title instead); `.download` to `$downloadUrl` (`catalog/download/…?inline=1`) with `common.download` and `common.downloadPdf`; an inline script calling `PDFJS.getDocument()` against pdf.js 2.6.347, whose build defines no `PDFJS` global; the viewer iframe `pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file={downloadUrl}`; the outdated notice with `filePublication`'s raw `datePublished` when `!$isLatestPublication`. `plugins/generic/htmlMonographFile/templates/display.tpl`: the same `<title>`; `.return` with screen-reader text `monograph.return`, a key no locale file of OMP, lib/pkp or the plugin defines; `.title` linking `catalog/book/{bestId}/{formatBestId}/{fileBestId}`, an address `book()` reads as the current book page; the iframe loads `$downloadUrl`, which the plugin's `downloadCallback()` answers with the file's HTML (`HtmlGalleyHelper::getHTMLContents()`, media resolved) and returns, firing its own `UsageEvent`; a file whose `omp://monograph/` link makes `handleOmpUrl()` throw falls through to `CatalogBookHandler::download()`, which serves the file as stored (A25). Live-probed 2026-09-28 and 2026-10-05: see td22 and td21. OJS and OPS galley PDFs render in their viewer and download as "article.pdf" and "preprint.pdf".

Pressing "Download" left the page as it was, and the browser's download of "192.html" was cancelled; the address alone answered 500 with an empty page. The viewer's toolbar read "of 0" pages under a red bar "Unexpected server response." ("More Information" adds "Unexpected server response (500) while retrieving PDF …"); its own "Download" started "document.pdf" and failed. Re-driven 2026-10-05 on OMP `main` at omp `8c807c919` (two runs; a visitor, a Reader and the Press manager; also on an older version's file, a supplementary PDF and a book with a URL Path): the bar's "Download" carries the `download` attribute and `…/catalog/download/{book}/{format}/{file}?inline=1`, and pressing it saved article.pdf (243 bytes) with the page unchanged; the frame `pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=…` fetched the file 200 `application/pdf`, `inline;filename=article.pdf`; the toolbar read "1" "of 1", one page rendered, no red bar; the viewer's own "Download" saved article.pdf. "Zoom In" moved "Automatic Zoom" to 140%, "Find in Document" opened its find bar, and "Print", "Open File", "Switch to Presentation Mode" and "Tools" were enabled; "Previous Page" and "Next Page" were disabled on the one-page file.

The file holding only a link `omp://press` opened under the tab "HTML view of the file …" with its frame reading "Press link Visit the press.", the link's address the press's home page, followed inside the frame to the press's home page. `HtmlGalleyHelper::handleOmpUrl()` rewrites `omp://press` and `omp://monograph/{id}` links; the second fails (f-a25).

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — `CatalogBookHandler::book()`: `version/{publicationId}` picks that publication from the submission's publications into the typed property `public Publication $publication` (no default), so an id matching none leaves it uninitialized and the following `!$this->publication` throws "must not be accessed before initialization" (a server error); an unpublished publication without `canPreview()` throws not found; a non-numeric first argument that is not the version's `urlPath` and has no sub-path is meant to redirect to the current `urlPath` (or id), but passes a string path to `PKPRequest::redirect()`, which takes `?array $path` since lib/pkp bee9547b49 (2024-06-26), so the redirect throws a TypeError, a server error (A16); a numeric one is never redirected. The URL Path resolves through `Repo::submission()->getByUrlPath()`. An unknown number or path fails `OmpPublishedSubmissionRequiredPolicy` with `user.authorization.invalidPublishedSubmission` "An invalid published submission was specified." (OMP `locale/en/locale.po`), and `PKPPageRouter::handleAuthorizationFailure()` sends a signed-out user to Login and a signed-in one to `user/authorizationDenied`. Submission status: `Repo::submission()->getStatusByPublications()` returns published only for a published publication whose `versionStage` is the final stage (Version of Record); the current publication is the last published one in version order (`getCurrentPublicationIdByPublications()`). Notices: `submission.viewingPreview` (link `dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}`) when the shown publication is not published, and `submission.outdatedVersion` whenever it is not the current publication, with `datePublished|date_format:$dateFormatShort`. Incidentals: the URL Path (U70 claim check K5, 2026-09-27: `catalog/book/{path}` opens, catalog links use the path, `catalog/book/{id}` still opens); the Author Original only (U68 claim check K2, 2026-09-27: the book's page answered 404); the unknown number (U16 claim check K4, 2026-09-25: `catalog/book/999999` landed a visitor on Login).

After a new version saved "harbour-2" and was published, `…/catalog/book/harbour` answered 500 with a blank page to a visitor, while `…/harbour/version/{id}` still opened; while "harbour-2" sat on the unpublished version, `…/catalog/book/harbour-2` answered the same to a visitor and the Press manager. The chapter page's cover and "Volume" linked `…/catalog/book/{number}`.

<a id="fn-td7"></a>
**td7** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 5; A4): with no date saved the preview had no "Published" and no "Versions"; with a date saved, "Published" and the date ("Forthcoming" for 2031-01-10) and a "Versions" heading over an empty list. "View submission" (`dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}`) took the Press manager and the Site Administrator to the workflow, gave the book's Author the access-denied page, and an unassigned Series editor and Copyeditor the Submissions page behind an "Error" window. A new version's preview showed both notices, the second "…published on 2026-09-28.", the new version's date being empty. Re-probed 2026-10-05 (Rules 5, 5a, 5b; A4, A17; two runs, the Rule 5 drive four): the preview opened under "This is a preview and has not been published. View submission" for the Press manager, an assigned and an unassigned Series editor, an unassigned Copyeditor, the book's Author (typing the address) and the Site Administrator, on a book never published and on a published book's new version; a Reader and a visitor got "404 Not Found". With no date saved, no "Published" and no "Versions"; dated 2024-06-01 on a book never published, "Published" "June 1, 2024" over an empty "Versions"; dated 2031-01-10, "Forthcoming" "January 10, 2031". A new version with "Date Published" 2025-01-15 saved on its "Catalog Entry" (the box read 2025-01-15 after a reload) read "Published" "March 5, 2024 — Updated on January 15, 2025" and "Versions" "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)" alone, while the published page kept "March 5, 2024". "View submission" opened the workflow (`dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}…&workflowMenuKey=workflow_5`) for the Press manager, the assigned Series editor and the Site Administrator; the Author got `user/authorizationDenied` "The current role does not have access to this operation."; the unassigned Series editor and Copyeditor the Submissions page ("Assigned to me (0)") behind the "Error" window with "OK". The unpublished book's chapter page opened with no notice for every previewing role, "Published June 1, 2024" on the dated book; a Reader and a visitor typing its address got "404 Not Found".

<a id="fn-td8"></a>
**td8** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 6; A5): the older version "Tides" opened from "Versions" read "This is an outdated version published on 2024-03-05. Read the most recent version." ("…05-03-2024." after "Date (Short)" d-m-Y); heading "Tides", tab "Tides Revised | …"; "most recent version" opened the book's address.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `monograph_full.tpl` `.item.date_published`: the label is `catalog.forthcoming` "Forthcoming" when the publication's `datePublished` (as `Y-m-d`) is after today's, `catalog.published` "Published" otherwise (pkp-lib#10169 fixed the comparison here); `$firstPublication` is computed in `book()` by reducing every publication of the submission (published or not) to the earliest `datePublished` (a publication without a date compares as earliest); the value is `submission.updatedOn` "{$datePublished} — Updated on {$dateUpdated}" with `$dateFormatLong` otherwise the first date alone. Versions: `array_reverse($monograph->getPublishedPublications())`, each `submission.versionIdentity` "{$datePublished} ({$version})" with `$dateFormatShort` and `versionString`; the list sits inside the date block, so a publication without a date shows neither. Seed fact (scenarios.md, `datePublished`): OMP shows "March 5, 2024" and "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)". A publication without a date prints as today: lib/pkp `PKPTemplateManager::smartyDateFormat()` formats it through `new Carbon(null)` (22c03902e1, 2024-09-06). Live-probed 2026-09-28: see td9, td23.

**td9** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 8): one version "March 5, 2024"; a second one published on the day "March 5, 2024 — Updated on September 28, 2026", "September 28 2026 — …" after the long format "F j Y" was chosen; the Press manager's preview of a book scheduled for 2031-01-10 "Forthcoming" "January 10, 2031". Right after "Create New Version" the live page read "September 28, 2026 — Updated on March 5, 2024", and with an unpublished third version "September 28, 2026 — Updated on September 28, 2026".

<a id="fn-td23"></a>
**td23** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 9): one version: "Versions" with "2024-03-05 (Version of Record 1.0)" in plain text; two: newest first, the shown one plain, the current one linking to the book's address, the older to `…/version/{id}`; a third, unpublished version and a second one unpublished again were not listed; "28-09-2026 (Version of Record 1.1)" after a short-format change.

Side column: `CatalogBookHandler::book()` keeps formats with `getIsAvailable()` (remote ones also in `remotePublicationFormats`) and files whose `directSalesPrice` is not null in an available format (`availableFiles`); `publicationFormats.tpl` prints a remote format (`urlRemote`, `target="_blank"`, not on a chapter page), a single file as `pub_format_single`, several as the format's name then per file `span.name` and a `downloadLink.tpl` with `useFilename=true`. `downloadLink.tpl`: with `useFilename` the file's name alone; otherwise, when `getDirectSalesPrice()` and `$currency`, the bare price followed by `payment.directSales.purchase` "Purchase {$format} ({$amount} {$currency})" (OMP `locale/en/locale.po`), else the format's name; the address `catalog/view/{bookBestId}/{formatBestId}/{fileBestId}` or with `version/{pid}` when the publication is not the current one. Incidental (U73 claim check K3, 2026-09-28): "25.00 Purchase PDF (25.00 USD)"; a two-file format listed "replacement.pdf", "article.pdf" where a one-file format read "PDF". Live-probed 2026-09-28: see td10, td11; the side column listed a press's formats in the Publication Formats page's order, and after a format was set "Not Available", or its approval revoked, the page and the side column both moved it last. Walked 2026-10-09 on OMP `main` (omp `57a9235110`, lib/pkp `27938abd4c`; Rule 10), two runs, each on a scratch press of its own, first seen 2026-10-08: a published Monograph's page, signed out, listed "Tides", "Harbours", "Estuaries", the order they were added in; the Press manager opened the published version's Chapters page (under "Warning: This version has been published. Editing it may impact the published content."), pressed "Order", dragged "Estuaries" above "Tides" and pressed "Done" (the chapters' `seq` then 1 "Estuaries", 2 "Tides", 3 "Harbours"); the page, opened again signed out with the version neither unpublished nor published again, listed "Estuaries", "Tides", "Harbours", "Tides" and "Harbours" each still followed by its author. Until pkp/pkp-lib#13453 (merged 2026-10-07) "Order" could not move a chapter ([Chapters & work type](U72-chapters-work-type.md), its retired A6), so only the order the chapters were added in could be read before. Walked 2026-10-01 on OMP `main` (issue report `docs/issues/U69-A15-omp-french-purchase-link-and-availability-title-wrong.md`, Evidence, seen in passing): on the default dataset's book 14, after a second version was published, its two files under "PDF" changed places from one run of the same steps to the next (cause not traced; seen on the side column, the table of contents' order not read).

<a id="fn-td10"></a>
**td10** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 10; A6): "Tides" (page ticked, subtitle "Low and high") a link to `…/chapter/{n}`, "Harbours" and "Coda" plain text; a single-author book showed its author under each chapter with authors, a two-contributor book's chapter credited to both "Ada Author, Lee Second", a chapter with no authors no name; each chapter's file links under the chapter only, none in the side column; the chapter's DOI "DOI: https://doi.org/10.1234/…" as a link.

<a id="fn-td11"></a>
**td11** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 11b; A8): format "Two" read "Two", "replacement.pdf" with a link "replacement.pdf", "article.pdf" with a link "article.pdf"; the priced file's link had no price and no "Purchase", and led a visitor to Login and a Reader to "Manual Fee Payment" ("Fee" "25.00 (USD)"); the free one opened its view page.

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — `monograph_full.tpl` `.item.publication_format`, per available format `{if $publicationFormat->getIsApproved()}`, skipped when it has no identification codes, no publication dates, no stored public identifier or DOI and is not physical; the heading `monograph.publicationFormatDetails` "Details about the available publication format: {$format}" (screen reader) plus the visible `.item_heading` name when `count($publicationFormats) > 1`, else `monograph.miscellaneousDetails` "Details about this monograph"; codes `IdentificationCode::getNameForONIXCode()` (ONIX list 5) and value; dates `PublicationDate::getNameForONIXCode()` and `getReadableDates()` (a range joined by an em dash; "Hijri Calendar" under a Hijri date); public identifiers labelled with the plugin's raw `getPubIdType()` (U44's OMP2); the format's DOI with `doi.readerDisplayName`; `monograph.publicationFormat.productDimensions` "Physical Dimensions" with `getDimensions()` (width, height, thickness each followed by its unit code, joined by `monograph.publicationFormat.productDimensionsSeparator` " x "). Seed-facts (U44 claim check K4, 2026-09-24): the block shows only once the format reads "Approved" and "Available". Live-probed 2026-09-28: see td12; a date seeded without a format read "2024-03-05" with "Hijri Calendar" under it, one in "YYYYMMDD" "2024-03-05" alone; the URN block read "other::urn" with the URN as plain text, the DOI line "DOI:" with a link.

<a id="fn-td12"></a>
**td12** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 12): one block, for "Paperback", with the visible heading "Paperback" and the screen-reader heading "Details about the available publication format: Paperback", the labels "ISBN-13 (15)" and "Publication date (01)", "Physical Dimensions" "130mm x 200mm" ("150mm x 230mm x 20mm" with a thickness); "PDF" (approved, nothing else) no block; a single available format "Details about this monograph". "Paperback" set "Awaiting Approval": its block gone, its and a remote format's links still listed.

<a id="fn-j"></a>
**j** — `CatalogBookHandler::view()` calls `download(…, true)`. `download()` answers not found for a format that is missing, not available or remote, a publication not published or not the format's, a file not of the format or with a null `directSalesPrice`; a dependent file of an HTML file and a publication's media file are served early. For a free file (`directSalesPrice === '0'`) or one the user has paid (`OMPCompletedPaymentDAO::hasPaidPurchaseFile()`): a signed-out user on a press with `restrictMonographAccess` is sent to Login (`Validation::redirectLogin()`); `view` offers the file to `CatalogBookHandler::view` (pdfJsViewer takes `application/pdf`, htmlMonographFile `text/html`); then `CatalogBookHandler::download` (htmlMonographFile serves `text/html`; pdfJsViewer only sets `inline`); otherwise it fires the `UsageEvent` with `publication: $publication`, the local variable, and serves the file through `app()->get('file')->download()`, `inline` when `?inline=1`, as an attachment under its name otherwise. Before omp `8c807c919` (pkp/pkp-lib#13444, 2026-10-05) the event read the typed property `$this->publication`, which `download()` never sets, so every such download threw "Typed property APP\pages\catalog\CatalogBookHandler::$publication must not be accessed before initialization" (A9, retired). `restrictMonographAccess` is OMP `UserAccessForm`'s `manager.setup.restrictMonographAccess` "Users must be registered and log in to view open access content." (OMP `locale/en/manager.po`). Before that fix (seed-facts, 2026-09-28, U73 claim check K3, K4; U54 claim check K1, K4): every `catalog/download/…` answered 500, the view page logged "PDFJS is not defined"; U47 claim check K2 (2026-09-24): with "HTML Monograph File" off an HTML file answered 500 with a blank page. Live-probed 2026-09-28 and 2026-10-05: see td13.

<a id="fn-td13"></a>
**td13** — Live-probed 2026-09-28, before omp `8c807c919` (Actors row 3; Rule 13; A9): signed out, "PDF" opened the PDF view page, "HTML" the HTML view page, an EPUB or a "notes.md" file's link a blank page (500); with "PDF.js PDF Viewer" or "HTML Monograph File" switched off by the Press manager, their links answered 500 with a blank page; the same on a chapter page's file link and for a signed-in Reader. On a press with "…view open access content." ticked, "PDF" sent a visitor to `login?source=/index.php/{press}/catalog/view/…`, and signing in there as a Reader landed on the PDF view page. An older version's file carried "This is an outdated version published on 2026-09-28. …" on both view pages, whose link opened the current page, while the book's date line read "September 28, 2026"; a changed short date format was not tried on the view pages. Re-driven 2026-10-05 on OMP `main` at omp `8c807c919` (Actors row 3; Rule 13; two runs; a visitor, a Reader and the Press manager): "PDF" and a supplementary "Appendix" PDF opened the PDF view page (tab "SuppPdf view of the file replacement.pdf" for the second); "HTML" the HTML view page; notes.md (a Book Manuscript file and an "Appendix" file) and the .epub answered 200 `attachment;filename=…` and were saved under their names (98 and 954 bytes), the browser staying on the book's page; with "PDF.js PDF Viewer" off article.pdf (243 bytes), and with "HTML Monograph File" off article.html (282 bytes), downloaded the same way. An older version's PDF, HTML and other file opened or downloaded; no `catalog/view` or `catalog/download` address answered 500. On the press with "…view open access content." ticked, a visitor's "PDF" landed on `login?source=%2Findex.php%2F{press}%2Fcatalog%2Fview%2F…`, and signing in there as the Reader landed on the PDF view page with the PDF shown.

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — Fall-through of `CatalogBookHandler::download()` for a priced, unpaid file: no user → redirect to Login with `source` the file's `view` address; `OMPPaymentManager::isConfigured()` (the chosen plugin's `isConfigured()`, the manual plugin needing `manualInstructions`, PayPal `accountName`, and the context's `currency`) false → redirect to `catalog`; otherwise `createQueuedPayment(PAYMENT_TYPE_PURCHASE_FILE, …)` with `setRequestUrl()` `catalog/view/{submissionId}/{formatId}/{fileId}`, `queuePayment()` and the plugin's payment form. `paymentsEnabled` is read by no OMP code but the form's `showWhen`. Manual plugin (`plugins/paymethod/manual`): `paymentForm.tpl` ("Manual Fee Payment", "Title" `getPaymentName()` = the file's name, "Fee" `%.2f` with the currency code, `plugins.paymethod.manual.sendNotificationOfPayment`); `handle()` op `notify` sends `ManualPaymentNotify` and shows `message.tpl` with "Payment Notification", "Payment notification sent" and `common.continue` to the queued payment's request URL. `OMPPaymentManager::fulfillQueuedPayment()` writes the completed payment that `hasPaidPurchaseFile()` reads, reached from PayPal's return through `pages/payment/PaymentHandler::plugin()`; OMP has no `pages/payments`, and nothing in OMP completes a manual payment (Payments & APCs, its note b). The settings form: `PKPPaymentSettingsForm`. Live-probed 2026-09-28: see td14, td15. With "Paypal Fee Payment" and only "Account Name" saved ("Client ID" and "Secret" empty), a Reader's priced link opened a page with the tab "| {press name}", no heading and "A transaction error occurred. Please contact the press manager for details.", and the browser made no outside request; being sent on to PayPal, and a paid file opening free afterwards, need a live PayPal account a test install does not reach. The "Payments" tab on a new press showed "Enable" alone. The Press manager, a Series editor, a Copyeditor, a Reviewer, an Author, a Reader and the Site Administrator each got "Manual Fee Payment" from the priced link.

<a id="fn-td14"></a>
**td14** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Actors rows 4, 5; Rule 14; Fields, the payment page; A18): the link read "25 Purchase PDF (25 USD)" (price typed "25"). Signed out it led to Login, and signing in there as a Reader landed on the press's home page, for "PDF" and for a several-file format's priced file. The Reader's payment page: "Manual Fee Payment", the press's instructions, "Title" "article.pdf", "Fee" "25.00 (USD)"; "Send notification of payment" led to "Payment Notification", "Payment notification sent" and "Continue", and "Continue" to the payment page again. No "Payments" in the Press manager's menu; `{press}/payments` answered 404. A press with no currency: link "PDF", to the catalog; USD without instructions: "25 Purchase PDF (25 USD)", to the catalog. Live-probed 2026-09-29, two runs, a press with USD, "Manual Fee Payment" and instructions (Actors row 4; Rule 14; Fields, the payment page; A18): signed out, the link led to `login?source=http://…/catalog/view/{id}/{format}/{file}`, a Login page with only "Required fields are marked with an asterisk: *" above the form; signing in there as a Reader landed on `{press}/index`, as the Press manager on `dashboard/editorial`, headed "Assigned to me (0)", tab "Submissions"; the Reader, signed in, pressing the link again got the payment page at once. That page: "Home / Manual Fee Payment", "Manual Fee Payment", the instructions, then a borderless table with "Title" and "Fee" and their values in bold, then "Send notification of payment" as an underlined text link (`paymentForm.tpl`); a journal's page, same run, showed a bordered table with the labels in bold, the instructions under it and the link styled as a button, and its Login page read "Subscription or article purchase required to access item. …".

<a id="fn-td15"></a>
**td15** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 14b; A12): "Enable" unticked and saved ("Saved"); after a reload the tab showed "Enable" alone; the Reader's and a visitor's link still read "25 Purchase PDF (25 USD)", and it still opened "Manual Fee Payment".

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — `CatalogBookHandler::setChapter()` finds the chapter by `getBySourceChapterId()` within the shown publication (not found otherwise); `book()` answers not found when `!isPageEnabled()` (`Chapter::isPageEnabled()` true for the stored flag or a DOI). Dates: `$datePublished` is the chapter's `datePublished` when `getEnableChapterPublicationDates()` and set, else the publication's; `$firstDatePublished` from `getChaptersFirstPublishedDate()` (the source chapter's publication, with the chapter's own date under the same rule). `chapter.tpl` labels "Forthcoming" when `$publication->getData('datePublished')|date_format:$dateFormatShort > $smarty.now|date_format:$dateFormatShort`, a string comparison in the press's short format. Versions only when `count(getPublishedPublications()) > 1`; `$chapterPublicationIds` are the publications whose copy of the chapter has its page; suffixes `submission.chapterCreated` " — Chapter created" and `submission.withoutChapter` "{$name} — Without this chapter" (OMP `locale/en/submission.po`). The notice links to `catalog/book/{bestId}/chapter/{sourceChapterId}` when the current publication is among `$chapterPublicationIds`, else to the book. The older-version chapter page throws in `ChapterDAO::getCurrentPublicationChapterDoi()` (`count()` on an integer, called from `CatalogBookHandler.php` line 189) unless the press has DOI versioning on (A19). Live-probed 2026-09-28: see td16, td17; "Tides" is `/chapter/61` in both versions; an unticked chapter, a removed one, an unknown number, another book's chapter number and an unpublished book's chapter (for a visitor) answered 404. On a published chapter with a DOI, "Chapter Page" unticked and saved reopened ticked and the page stayed.

<a id="fn-td16"></a>
**td16** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 16a; A13): under "d/m/Y" a 2024-12-31 book's chapter read "Forthcoming", its book "Published"; a 2024-03-05 book's chapter "Published"; a chapter of a book scheduled for 2027-01-15 "Published" in the Press manager's preview, its book "Forthcoming". Under the default format that scheduled chapter read "Forthcoming", and a visitor got 404. With "Each chapter may have its own publication date." a chapter dated 2024-06-01 read "June 1, 2024", one without its own date the version's "December 31, 2024"; "All chapters…" gave both the version's date.

The older chapter page's notice led to "Tides"' current page, and for "Coda" to the book's; its cover and "Volume" to `…/version/{id}`. On a press left at "No" the older chapter address answered 500 with a blank page, typed and from "Versions". With chapter dates, "Tides"' current page read "June 1, 2024 — Updated on June 1, 2024"; without, "Reef" "March 5, 2024 — Updated on September 28, 2026"; "Harbours" "September 28, 2026".

**t** — Lib/pkp's `OpenReviewComponent` (the public-review display's data) is used by no OMP handler or template: `CatalogBookHandler::book()` prepares no review data and `monograph_full.tpl` mounts no review display (code read on checkout omp `3b0ecf794`, lib/pkp `3dc90c81a6`, 2026-10-05).

Two books in External Review, each with one submitted Open review whose "For author and editor" comment carried a unique word. On the first, the reviewer row's "More Actions" › "Edit" offered "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" unticked, to the Press manager and to the book's assigned Series editor; ticked and saved (`is_review_publicly_visible` true), it reopened ticked.

You will have the opportunity to thank the reviewer in the next step."; confirmed, "The review has been marked as complete." and the row "Complete". The second book's review, left unticked, got the dialog without the "publicly visible" sentence. Both were accepted and published as a Version of Record. Each book's page, read by a visitor (twice, the second after a reload), and the first also by the press's Reader and the Press manager, held its title, "Authors", "Synopsis", "References", "Published", "Versions" and the copyright line: neither review's comment in the text or the page's source, no reviewer name ("Rhea Openreviewer"), no review heading, no request for review data, no failed request; the catalog page showed neither comment. Other end: a second press with "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" on, its book seeded published with a submitted Open review whose box was ticked (not marked complete): no review on the book's page.

Live-probed 2026-09-28: see td25; the day's usage log gained one book line per book page opened and one chapter line per chapter page, and none for a file pressed ("PDF", "HTML", another file), where OJS and OPS log one per galley view and download (A9, before its fix). Live-probed 2026-10-05 at omp `8c807c919` (Side effects; two runs; the run's own presses): one line of type 515 per opening of a PDF or HTML view page, per bar "Download" and per download from a file's link (`catalog/download/{book}/{format}/{file}` 7 lines for three roles' PDF views and downloads and one more view), type 531 for each "Appendix" file (notes.md, replacement.pdf, 3 each); an older version's raw-file download was logged under the current version's address.

<a id="fn-td25"></a>
**td25** — Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Side effects): from "Rae Reader" at the buyer's address to "Pat Contact", the principal contact, no copy; subject "Manual Payment Notification"; the body as quoted, with the press's name, the buyer's name and username, "article.pdf" and "The cost is 25 (USD)." (the payment page "25.00 (USD)"); a second press sent a second message. "Manage Emails" has no row for it (33 rows; "Payment" finds "No items found."). The Reader's reading, file opening, citation download and payment page moved no mailbox and showed no notice.

<a id="fn-r"></a>
**r** — Plugin defaults: `plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer/settings.xml` and `plugins/generic/htmlMonographFile/settings.xml` install `enabled` true per press; the Citation Style Language plugin declares none (off). Display names: "PDF.js PDF Viewer", "HTML Monograph File", "Citation Style Language" (each plugin's `locale/en/locale.po`). Seed-facts (U13 claim check K2, 2026-09-25): "PDF.js PDF Viewer" and "HTML Monograph File" arrive ticked on a press; the Citation Style Language plugin is off on a scratch context (U07 claim check K2, 2026-09-23). "View Monograph Content" group: seed-facts note of U48 claim check K2, 2026-09-25. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Settings bullets 1–3, 6; Actors row 7): on a new press "PDF.js PDF Viewer" and "HTML Monograph File" arrive ticked and "Citation Style Language" unticked; unticking a plugin asks "Are you sure you want to disable this plugin?"; the Press manager and the Press editor open "Plugins", "Appearance" and "Payments", and a Series editor gets "The current role does not have access to this operation." there; "…view open access content." sits under "View Monograph Content", unticked on a new press.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Scenario seeding. Every press, journal and server is a scratch
context from `POST scenarios/context` with throwaway `users[]` (passwords
the username twice, `docs/process/users.md`): a `manager` (Press manager),
an `author` (the books' submitter, `givenName: 'Ada', familyName:
'Quill'`, so that her own contributor entry reads "Ada Quill") and, where
a scenario names them, a `reader` (Reader), a `reviewer` (External
Reviewer) and a second `author2` (Author); the visitor is signed out.
Every book is a scratch submission from `POST scenarios/submission` with
`author` as `submitter`, `submitted: true`, `decisions:
['skipExternalReview', 'sendToProduction']`, `published: true` and
`datePublished: '2024-03-05'`; "Lee Marsh" is `contributors: [{givenName:
'Lee', familyName: 'Marsh', email: 'lee.marsh@mail.test'}]`, named by that
address in `chapters[].authors`. Formats seed through
`publicationFormats[]` (approved and available, a file on "Open Access"
unless `price` is given), chapters through `chapters[]`.
Scenario 1: the press with `series: [{path: 'monographs', title:
'Monographs'}]` and `categories: [{path: 'history', title: 'History'}]`;
the book with `subtitle`, `abstract`, `keywords: ['alpha', 'beta gamma']`,
`plainLanguageSummary`, `series: 'monographs'`, `categories: ['history']`,
`urlPath: 'shorelines'` and `publicationFormats: [{name: 'PDF', file:
'article.pdf'}, {name: 'Online', urlRemote:
'https://example.org/shorelines'}, {name: 'Paperback', physical: true,
identificationCodes: [{type: 'ISBN-13 (15)', value:
'978-951-98548-9-2'}], publicationDates: [{role: 'Publication date (01)',
date: '20240305'}], metadata: {productComposition: 'Single-component
retail product (00)', width: 130, height: 200}}]` (no `dateFormat`, so the
window's preselected "YYYYMMDD (H)"); "Bare" with `title`, `abstract`
and no other key. Scenario 2: the press with `enabledDoiTypes:
['publication', 'chapter']`, `doiPrefix: '10.1234'` and `themeOptions:
{displayStats: 'bar'}`; "Coastlines" with the two formats (`{name: 'PDF',
file: 'article.pdf'}`, `{name: 'Chapter PDF', file: 'replacement.pdf'}`)
and `chapters: [{title: 'Tides', subtitle: 'Low and high', abstract: 'How
the sea rises and falls.', pages: '1-20', page: true, authors: [Lee
Marsh], files: ['publicationFormats.1']}, {title: 'Harbours'}]`, the
publish making a DOI for the chapter with its page alone, and the
response's `chapters[].id` being the number a chapter's address takes
("Tides" seeded as 53 opened at `…/chapter/53`), which the control uses
for "Harbours"; "Reef Notes"
with `enableChapterPublicationDates: true` and `chapters: [{title: 'Reef',
datePublished: '2024-06-01', page: true}, {title: 'Lagoon', page:
true}]`. Scenario 3: `[{name: 'PDF', file: 'article.pdf'}, {name: 'HTML',
file: 'article.html'}]`. Scenario 4: the press with `payments: {currency:
'USD', paymentPluginName: 'ManualPayment', manualInstructions: '…'}` and
`context.contactName` / `contactEmail` for the principal contact;
`[{name: 'PDF', file: 'article.pdf', price: '25'}]`; the "Manual Payment
Notification" is sent at once, not queued, so the mail catcher is read
with no job queue run (test run 2026-09-28). Scenario 5: "Draft Tides" without
`published` (it rests in Production), the unfinished submission with
`submitted: false`, "Shorelines" published; the other Author is `author2`.
Scenarios 6 and 7: the first version seeded as above ("Tides"; "Coastlines"
with `chapters: [{title: 'Tides', page: true}, {title: 'Coda', page:
true}]`), then, as `manager`, "Create New Version"
(`PublicationPages.createNewVersion`), for scenario 6 the title changed
to "Tides Revised" on "Title & Abstract", for scenario 7 "Coda" deleted
and "Harbours" added with "Chapter Page" ticked on the version's Chapters
page, and the version published on screen that day; scenario 7's press
with `doiPrefix: '10.1234'` and `doiVersioning: true`. Scenario 8: the
press with `enableDois: false` and `plugins: {citationstylelanguageplugin:
{enabled: true}}`; `chapters: [{title: 'Tides', pages: '1-20', page:
true, authors: [Lee Marsh]}]`; its control on a scratch press with no
`plugins` key. Scenario 9: the press with `restrictMonographAccess:
true`. Scenario 10: OJS with `publishingMode: 'subscription'` and
`payments: {currency: 'USD', paymentPluginName: 'ManualPayment',
manualInstructions: '…', purchaseArticleFee: 5}` and `issues: [{volume:
1, number: 1, year: 2026, published: true}]` (an issue made under the
subscription mode takes "Subscription" access, which is what puts the
price on the galley link; with no issue the article's galleys carry no
price, `ArticleHandler` requiring a subscription only through an issue;
test run 2026-09-28, as U69 claim check K1 seeded it),
the article `published: true` into that issue (the submission's `issue`)
with `galleys: [{label: 'PDF', file: 'article.pdf'}]`;
OPS with the preprint `published: true` and `galleys: [{label: 'PDF',
file: 'preprint.pdf'}]`; the control on an OMP scratch press.
Live-probed 2026-09-28: `publicationFormats[]` (with `price`,
`urlRemote`, `physical`, `identificationCodes[]`, `publicationDates[]`,
`metadata`), `chapters[]` with `page` and `files`, `series`,
`categories`, `urlPath`, `datePublished`, `contributors[]`, and the
press's `payments`, `plugins`, `themeOptions`, `restrictMonographAccess`
and `doiVersioning` each seeded the state it names; a second version was
made on screen with "Create New Version".

**f-a1** — Note g (policy failure → Login or `user/authorizationDenied`). An unpublished book's address is refused later, in `book()`, with not found. Live-probed 2026-09-28, signed out and signed in (td4).

<a id="fn-f-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — Note g (`getStatusByPublications()` needs a published Version of Record); `canPreview()` lets the Press manager and the Site Administrator in, and the shown publication is published, so no preview notice prints. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td3): the book's page answered 404 to a visitor and a Reader and opened as published for the Press manager and the Site Administrator; the workflow showed the Author Original "Status: Published", the Version of Record "Status: Unpublished", and neither "View" nor "Preview". The catalog's leaving it out is Catalog browse's Rule 3.

<a id="fn-f-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — Note g: the uninitialized typed property `CatalogBookHandler::$publication` when `version/{id}` matches no publication of the submission; the log reads "Typed property APP\pages\catalog\CatalogBookHandler::$publication must not be accessed before initialization" (`CatalogBookHandler.php` line 122). The typed property dates from omp `29fa88508` (2025-03-20). Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td6): 500 for every id tried and every role.

<a id="fn-f-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — `monograph_full.tpl` prints `submission.viewingPreview` for any unpublished publication and `submission.outdatedVersion` for any publication that is not the current one, with that publication's empty `datePublished`, which prints as today (note h). Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td7). Live-probed 2026-10-05 (Rule 5b; four runs): the new version's preview read "This is an outdated version published on 2026-10-05. Read the most recent version." with no date saved, and "…published on 2025-01-15." once "Date Published" 2025-01-15 was saved on the version's "Catalog Entry".

<a id="fn-f-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — `downloadLink.tpl` prints `{$downloadFile->getDirectSalesPrice()}` before `payment.directSales.purchase`, which carries the amount again. Seen 2026-09-28 (U73 claim check K3). Live-probed 2026-09-28: a price typed "25" reads "25 Purchase PDF (25 USD)", so the number shows as typed.

**f-a8** — `publicationFormats.tpl` prints `span.name` and then `downloadLink.tpl` with `useFilename=true`, which skips the price branch. The two-file listing by file name seen 2026-09-28 (U73 claim check K3). Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td11): the priced file among two.

<a id="fn-f-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — Before the fix (note j): every free-file download reached the `UsageEvent` built with the never-set `$this->publication`; `view` of a PDF showed the pdfJsViewer page, whose inline `PDFJS` script fails (A23) and whose viewer loaded the failing download. The typed property dates from omp `29fa88508` (2025-03-20, pkp/pkp-lib#10671); the event's `publication: $this->publication` argument from omp `591d7a0e7` (2026-08-26, pkp/pkp-lib#12311, "pass publication to usage event"), which set it in `book()` but not in `download()`. Live-probed 2026-09-26 (U20 claim check), 2026-09-27 (U64), 2026-09-28 (U73 claim check K3, K4, three runs): `GET {press}/catalog/download/{book}/{format}/{file}`, with and without `?inline=1`, current or older version, answered 500 with the log line above; the view page logged "PDFJS is not defined" and "UnexpectedResponseException". Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td13, td22; two runs of each drive): 22 download 500s and 9 view 500s across the runs, "PDFJS is not defined" and "UnexpectedResponseException" on every PDF view page; the bar's "Download" and the viewer's both cancelled; the French view page (`{press}/fr_CA/catalog/download/…?inline=1`) the same. The same failure was recorded where it showed elsewhere: Search engine metadata & analytics' OMP6, Usage statistics' OMP3, Media files' OMP1 (HTML plugin off), each retired with this entry. Fixed upstream by omp `8c807c919` (pkp/pkp-lib#13444, 2026-10-05), whose `download()` passes the local `$publication` to the event (note j). Live-probed 2026-10-05 on OMP `main` at that commit (Rule 13; two runs; a visitor, a Reader and the Press manager): no `catalog/view` or `catalog/download` address answered 500 in any phase; the viewer read "of 1", and the bar's and the viewer's download saved article.pdf (243 bytes); notes.md, an .epub, article.pdf (viewer off) and article.html (HTML plugin off) answered `attachment` with their names; an older version's files opened or downloaded; for the priced file, a completed payment row for the Reader (as PayPal's return writes it, since no screen on a test install completes one) opened its PDF view page with the PDF shown and "Download" saved it, while the Press manager without one got the "Manual Fee Payment" page; each opening and download wrote a usage-log line (note q). PKP's default test dataset walked the same day agreed. "PDFJS is not defined" is still logged (A23).

<a id="fn-f-a11"></a>
**f-a11** — Note k. The manual plugin's own description reads "The manager will manually record receipt of a user's payment (outside of this software)."; nothing in OMP calls `fulfillQueuedPayment()` for a manual payment. The OMP purchase path dates from the early direct-sales work, and the missing record may be long-standing, hence ❓. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td14): "Continue" led back to the payment page and the Reader's link stayed priced; the Press manager's menu has no "Payments", and `{press}/payments` and `{press}/management/settings/payments` answered 404, where OJS's `{journal}/payments` opens its payment lists and OPS has none.

<a id="fn-f-a12"></a>
**f-a12** — Note k: `paymentsEnabled` is read only by the form's `showWhen`; `OMPPaymentManager::isConfigured()` ignores it, where OJS's payment paths check it. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td15).

**f-a13** — Note l: `chapter.tpl` compares `date_format:$dateFormatShort` strings, where `monograph_full.tpl` compares `Y-m-d` (pkp-lib#10169 fixed only the book page). Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td16): both directions. Walked 2026-10-01 on OMP `main` and `stable-3_5_0`, the default dataset's book 14 and its "Chapter 1: Mind Control—Internal or External?", reading the book's and the chapter's page under each of the four "Date (Short)" choices (`PKPDateTimeForm`: "Y-m-d", "d-m-Y", "m/d/Y", "d.m.Y"): dated 2024-12-31, the chapter read "Forthcoming December 31, 2024" under "01-10-2026", "10/01/2026" and "01.10.2026" and "Published" under "2026-10-01", the book "Published" throughout; scheduled for 2027-01-01, the preview's chapter read "Published January 1, 2027" and the book "Forthcoming". A "Custom" format is the 2026-09-28 probe's "d/m/Y" only.

**f-a18** — Note k: `CatalogBookHandler::download()` sends a signed-out buyer to Login with `source` built by `$request->url()`, a full address, and `LoginHandler::signIn()` follows only a `source` starting with "/", so `_redirectAfterLogin()` (its dashboard branch needs an empty `source`) falls back to `PKPPageRouter::getHomeUrl()`, the user's home by role: the press's index for a Reader, `dashboard/editorial` for a manager, sub-editor or assistant role, `dashboard/reviewAssignments` for a Reviewer (untried), `dashboard/mySubmissions` for an Author; a free file's Login (`Validation::redirectLogin()`) carries a path. "Register" on that Login page hands the same `source` to the registration form, and `RegistrationHandler::register()` applies the same path rule. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td13, td14): the priced file's Login address carried `source=http%3A%2F%2F…`, the free file's `source=%2Findex.php%2F…`. Live-probed 2026-09-29 (td14): the Press manager's sign-in went to `dashboard/editorial`. Walked 2026-10-01 on OMP `main`, the default dataset's book 14 with one "PDF" file set to "Direct Sales" at 25.00 USD with "Manual Fee Payment": signing in on the Login page the file's link opened took `aclark` (Author and Reader) to `dashboard/mySubmissions`, headed "Active submissions (1)", `rvaca` (Press manager) to `dashboard/editorial`, headed "Assigned to me (0)", and a Reader to `{press}/index`; a newcomer who pressed "Register" there and sent the form landed on "Registration complete" ("Thanks for registering!

<a id="fn-f-a21"></a>
**f-a21** — Note m: `CitationStyleLanguageHandler::setupRequest()` lets an unpublished submission through only for managers, the Site Administrator and assigned sub-editors or assistants, while the block itself shows to everyone `canPreview()` admits. Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td18).

<a id="fn-f-a22"></a>
**f-a22** — Note m: `seriesPosition` is passed as the CSL `volume`, which the APA style prints as "(Vols. {n})". Live-probed 2026-09-28 (td18).

<a id="fn-f-a23"></a>
**f-a23** — Note f: OMP's own `plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer/templates/display.tpl` loads `pdf.js/build/pdf.js` and `pdf.js/web/viewer.js` into the outer page and runs an inline script calling `PDFJS.workerSrc` and `PDFJS.getDocument()` for a `pdfCanvas` element no version of the template has; pdf.js has defined no `PDFJS` global since its version 2 (omp 02393cf8bf, 2019-05-13, updated the library and left the script), so the script throws at its first line. The viewer is the iframe `pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=…`, which loads the library for itself. OJS's and OPS's viewer plugin (the shared pkp/pdfJsViewer) has only the iframe script (code). Walked 2026-10-01 on OMP `main` and `stable-3_5_0`, the default dataset's book 5, "Epilogue"'s "PDF", signed out: the console logged "Uncaught ReferenceError: PDFJS is not defined" each time; on 3.5 the viewer showed the PDF ("of 1") and "Download" saved `epilogue.pdf`; on `main` the file request also answered 500 (A9, since fixed). Seen before: 2026-09-26 to 2026-09-28 on every PDF view page (f-a9); on 3.4 and 3.3 the same two lines (code). Upstream `pkp/pkp-lib#6425` (closed) notes the error in two comments and left it. Live-probed 2026-10-05 on `main` at omp `8c807c919` (two runs; a visitor, a Reader and the Press manager; the current and an older version's file, a supplementary PDF, a bought file, a book with a URL Path, the French view page): "Uncaught ReferenceError: PDFJS is not defined" on every PDF view page opened, the viewer showing the PDF ("of 1").
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#283](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/283) ([docs/issues/U69-A9-pdf-view-page-script-error.md](../issues/U69-A9-pdf-view-page-script-error.md)).

<a id="fn-f-a24"></a>
**f-a24** — Note j: `CatalogBookHandler::download()`, which `view()` calls, answers not found for any publication that is not published and never asks `Repo::submission()->canPreview()`, where `book()` does (note c). Refused on OMP `main` and `stable-3_5_0` (walked 2026-10-04 for the issue report pkp-e2e#920, its Cause's reach) and on 3.4 and 3.3 (code, same report). Live-probed 2026-10-05 (Rule 5c; Actors row 3; two runs): a new version of a published book, its formats "PDF" (article.pdf) and "HTML" (article.html) copied with the version, links `catalog/view/{id}/version/{pubId}/{formatId}/{fileId}`: "HTML" and "PDF" pressed by the Press manager, an unassigned Series editor, an unassigned Copyeditor, the book's Author and the Site Administrator each opened "404 Not Found"; the workflow header's "Preview" led to the same page and links. A book never published (`catalog/view/{id}/{formatId}/{fileId}`): the same for the Press manager, a Series editor, the Author and the Site Administrator. A visitor typing those addresses: "404 Not Found". Control: the published version's "HTML" and "PDF" opened their view pages. A journal's and a server's new-version preview opened the "PDF" reader page (200), whose file request then answered 404 (Article landing page & reading, its Rule 12 and A2).

<a id="fn-f-a25"></a>
**f-a25** — OMP `plugins/generic/htmlMonographFile/classes/HtmlGalleyHelper::handleOmpUrl()` passes `$urlParts[1]` (a string) as the path of `PKPRequest::url()`, whose path is `?array` since lib/pkp bee9547b49 (2024-06-26, the change behind A16); `Hook::call()` logs the plugin's TypeError and carries on, and `CatalogBookHandler::download()` then serves the file as stored, its `omp://` links unrewritten (before omp `8c807c919` it failed on A9's line instead). OJS's `htmlArticleGalley` twin passes a list. 3.5 (code): the same call in `HtmlMonographFilePlugin.php` against the same signature and the same hook catch. Fix shape as A16's: `[$urlParts[1]]`. The A16 issue report (pkp-e2e#284) names this caller in its Cause and leaves it out of its fix. Live-probed 2026-10-05 before omp `8c807c919` (Fields, the HTML view page; two runs; a visitor, a Reader and the Press manager): the file holding `omp://monograph/{id}` opened the tab "HTML view of the file i05-monograph-link-r1-omp.html", whose frame `catalog/download/{id}/{format}/{file}?inline=1` answered 500 and stayed empty; the log read "TypeError: PKP\core\PKPRequest::url(): Argument #4 ($path) must be of type ?array, string given, called in …/htmlMonographFile/classes/HtmlGalleyHelper.php on line 159", then "Uncaught Error: Typed property APP\pages\catalog\CatalogBookHandler::$publication must not be accessed before initialization in …/CatalogBookHandler.php:533". Re-probed the same day at omp `8c807c919` (A25's symptom; two runs; the same three users): a file holding "See also the other book and the press." with links `omp://monograph/{id}` and `omp://press` opened its HTML view page, its frame `catalog/download/{id}/{format}/{file}?inline=1` answering 200 `text/html` with the text shown; both links kept their `omp://` addresses, and pressing either changed neither the frame's nor the page's address, opened no tab and raised no page error; the server logged the TypeError above at each opening, and no request answered an error. The file whose only link is `omp://press` still had it rewritten to the press's home page and followed there. Control: td26.

<a id="fn-f-a26"></a>
**f-a26** — Note t: OMP never prepares or mounts the display; OJS's `ArticleHandler::view()` prepares it and its template never mounts it (U13 OJS12). The OJS12 issue report ([pkp-e2e#218](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/218), [docs/issues/U13-OJS12-public-review-never-shown.md](../issues/U13-OJS12-public-review-never-shown.md)) found the OMP twin in the code and proposes a fix for the article page's template only, which does not reach a book's page. OMP `stable-3_5_0`: not driven; OJS 3.5 has no "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" (that report's Affects). Live-probed 2026-10-05 (two runs): note t.

<a id="fn-f-a27"></a>
**f-a27** — Note c: the same `canPreview()` role shortcut as U13 A16, with no stage check on `main` since pkp/pkp-lib#12245 (`768b0a3991`, Alec Smecher, 2026-02-18); the fix, the release check (3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 do not have it) and the evidence are there. Live-probed 2026-09-30, OMP `main`, seeded data: unassigned `mfritz` (Copyeditor) and `cturner` (Proofreader) opened books 3, 6 and 18, before copyediting. Security-shaped and unreleased: its issue report carries "- **Security** unreleased" (REPORT.md).
Issue report (with U13 A16): [pkp-e2e#921](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/921) ([docs/issues/U13-A16-unassigned-staff-read-pre-acceptance-pages.md](../issues/U13-A16-unassigned-staff-read-pre-acceptance-pages.md)).
