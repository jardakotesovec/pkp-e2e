# Article landing page & reading {OJS OPS}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

Every published article has a public page of its own, its **landing
page**: the page a reader reaches from an issue's table of contents, the
home page, a category page, a search result, a link someone shared or
the article's address typed by hand. It shows what the article is (title,
contributors, abstract, keywords, dates and versions, references, how to
cite it) and lists the article's galleys, the files a reader opens: a PDF
opens in a reader page, a journal's HTML full text in a reader page of its
own, anything else downloads. This spec describes that
page, its addresses and versions, the galley readers, the "How to Cite"
block and its settings, the extra blocks a journal can switch on, and the
short summary of an article that the listing pages print. On a preprint
server the page is the preprint's page, and "Published" reads "Posted".
<sup>a</sup>

Several blocks on the page are described by the feature that fills them:
the contributors and their biographies
([Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md)),
the "License", "Data Availability Statement" and "Funding Statement"
blocks ([Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md)), "Funders"
([Funding](U43-funding.md)), a journal's "URN"
([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)), a journal's comments blocks
([Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md)),
a journal's "JATS XML" link (*JATS & Body Text*) and a journal's
Crossmark button (*DOIs*). A press's book page is a separate feature, *Monograph landing
page*. <sup>a</sup>

## Actors & permissions

The page is public: a **visitor** needs no account, and signing in, as a
Reader or in any other role, changes nothing in a published version's
page content except the comments blocks
([Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md)).
A journal that requires visitors to sign in ("Users must be registered
and log in to view the journal site."; "…to view the server site." on a
preprint server) or that the Site Administrator has not enabled sends a
signed-out visitor who opens an article's page or a galley's address to
the Login page; a signed-in Reader of the journal reads it. Both settings
are described in
[Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md)
(its Settings bullets 7 and 8). On a journal that sells subscriptions,
what a visitor may open is *Subscriptions & open access control*'s.

## Fields & validation

<a id="page"></a>
**The landing page.** Two columns: the main column with the article's
text, and beside it a narrower column with the files and the details. A
part appears only when the version has something to put in it (Rule 6).
Top to bottom, the main column holds: <sup>c</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Breadcrumb** | — | Journal: "Home / Archives / {issue} / {section}", the issue left out for an article in no issue; preprint server: "Home / {section}" ("Home / Preprints" on the seeded server). "Home", "Archives" and the issue are links. <sup>c</sup> |
| **Notices** | — | The preview notice (Rule 4) or the older-version notice (Rule 5). |
| **Label line** {OPS} | — | Above the title: "Preprint / {date} ({version name})" (Rule 9). |
| **Title**, **subtitle** | — | The version's title as the page heading, its subtitle under it. <sup>c</sup> |
| **Contributors** | — | The contributor list described in [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md), its Rule 14. |
| **"DOI:"** | — | The version's DOI as its full address ("https://doi.org/…"), a link. Which DOI an older version shows, and how a version gets one, is *DOIs*'. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Keywords:"** | — | The version's keywords in the interface language, joined by commas, as plain text. They come in no fixed order, not always the order they were typed in ⚠ [A11](#a11). The label is a raw code on a preprint server's French page [OPS7](#ops7). <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Abstract"** | — | The abstract, as formatted in the editor. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Plain Language Summary"** | — | The plain language summary, under its own heading. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Downloads"** | — | The chart of Rule 17, only when the theme is set to show one. |
| **"Author Biography"** / **"Author Biographies"** | — | Described in [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md), its Rule 14. |
| **"References"** | — | Rule 18. |
| **"Comments on this publication"** {OJS} | — | Described in [Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md). |
| **Recommendations** {OJS} | — | Under the article, the lists of Rule 20 when their plugins are on; neither list ever appears [OJS4](#ojs4) [OJS10](#ojs10). <sup>n</sup> |

The side column, top to bottom on a journal: <sup>c</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Cover image** | — | The version's cover image. On a journal, an article with no cover image of its own in an issue with a cover shows the issue's cover instead, as a link to the issue's page. <sup>c</sup> <sup>q6</sup> |
| **Galley links** | — | The main galleys (Rule 10). |
| **"JATS XML"** {OJS} | — | A link to the article's JATS XML, while it is public (*JATS & Body Text*). |
| **Additional files** | — | The galleys of supplementary components (Rule 10). |
| **"Published"** ("Posted") | — | The date line of Rule 7. |
| **"Versions"** | — | The list of Rule 8. |
| **"Data Availability Statement"**, **"Funding Statement"** | — | Described in [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md), its Rule 15. |
| **"Issue"** {OJS} | — | The issue's name ("Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)"), a link to the issue's page. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Section"** {OJS} | — | The section's name, plain text. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Categories"** | — | The version's categories, each a link to that category's page. A preprint server names a subcategory "{parent} > {subcategory}"; a journal prints the subcategory's own name. <sup>c</sup> <sup>q6</sup> |
| **"Article Number"** {OJS} | — | The version's article number, plain text. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Funders"** | — | Described in [Funding](U43-funding.md), its Rule 9. |
| **"Comments"** {OJS} | — | Described in [Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md). |
| **"URN"** {OJS} | — | Described in [Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md), its Rule 21. |
| **"License"** | — | Described in [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md), its Rule 15. |
| **"How to Cite"** | — | Rule 15, at the foot of the column. On a preprint server it sits right after "Categories", above the statements. <sup>q6</sup> |
| **Publication Facts** {OJS} | — | The panel of Rule 19, which never appears [OJS5](#ojs5). <sup>q6</sup> |

On a preprint server the side column runs: cover image, galley links,
additional files, "Posted", "Versions", "Categories", "How to Cite", "Data
Availability Statement", "Funding Statement", "Funders", "License". <sup>c</sup>

**The PDF reader page.** Opened from a PDF galley (Rule 11). A bar across
the top holds a return arrow, the version's title and a "Download" button;
under it the PDF fills the page in a viewer with its own page, zoom, search
and print controls, a sidebar of page thumbnails, drawing and highlighting
tools ("Highlight", "Text", "Draw", "Add or edit images") and a "Save"
that downloads the file. On an older version's galley an outdated-version
notice sits between the bar and the viewer (Rule 12). The browser tab
reads "View of {title}"; on a French page a journal's reads "Vue de
{title}" and a preprint server's "##article.pageTitle##" ⚠ [OPS8](#ops8).
<sup>d</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Return arrow** | — | An arrow with no visible text. A screen reader reads "Return to Issue Details" for a journal article in an issue ⚠ [OJS6](#ojs6), "Return to Article Details" for one in no issue, and "##article.return##" on a preprint server ⚠ [OPS5](#ops5). Opens the article's page. <sup>d</sup> |
| **Title** | — | The galley's version's title, a link to the article's page. <sup>d</sup> |
| **"Download"** | — | Downloads the PDF under its file name. A screen reader reads "Download PDF". <sup>d</sup> |

**The HTML reader page** {OJS}. Opened from an HTML galley (Rule 11): the
same bar with the return arrow ("Return to Article Details") and the
title, no "Download", and the HTML full text filling the page under it.
The title is the current version's, even on an older version's galley.
<sup>e</sup> <sup>q9</sup>

<a id="how-to-cite"></a>
**The "How to Cite" block.** Shown while the "Citation Style Language"
plugin is on (Settings bullet 4). <sup>h</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **"How to Cite"** | — | The heading, then the citation of the shown version in the journal's primary format (APA until a manager chooses another, Rule 16). <sup>h</sup> |
| **"More Citation Formats"** | — | A button that opens a list of the formats the journal offers: "ABNT", "ACM", "ACS", "AMA", "APA", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "MLA", "Turabian", "Vancouver" on a new journal (Rule 15a). With none offered it opens nothing (Rule 16, [A9](#a9)). <sup>h</sup> |
| **"Download Citation"** | — | Under the formats, inside the same list, while at least one download format is on: "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" and "BibTeX" on a new journal (Rule 15b). <sup>h</sup> |

**The "Citation Style Language" settings window.** Settings › Website ›
"Plugins" › "Installed Plugins", the "Citation Style Language" row's
"Settings" (the row offers it only while the plugin is on). <sup>i</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Citation Format** | No | "Select which citation format you would like to display by default on your article landing page." One choice per format, as listed above. On a new journal none is chosen and the page uses APA. <sup>i</sup> <sup>q12</sup> |
| **Additional Citation Formats** | No | "Select which additional formats you'd like to offer your readers." A box per format, all ticked on a new journal. <sup>i</sup> |
| **Downloadable Formats** | No | "Select which downloadable formats you'd like to offer your readers. Downloadable formats are typically used for importing into third-party bibliography management software, like EndNote or Zotero." The two download formats, both ticked on a new journal. <sup>i</sup> |
| **Publisher Location** | No | Under 'Some citation formats request the geographic location of the publisher, such as "London, U.K.".' Any text; empty on a new journal. <sup>i</sup> |
| **OK** / **Cancel** | — | "OK" stores all four, closes the window and shows "Your changes have been saved."; "Cancel" stores nothing and asks nothing. The window's "Close" after a change asks "The data on this form has changed. Do you wish to continue without saving?", and leaving the page asks the browser's "Leave site?"; nothing is stored either way. <sup>i</sup> <sup>q12</sup> |

**The "Publication Facts Label plugin" settings window** {OJS}. The
plugin row's "Settings". It opens with the warning "Funding Plugin Not
Present" ⚠ [OJS2](#ojs2), then these fields. Its "OK", "Cancel" and
"Close" behave as the "Citation Style Language" window's. When "OK" is
refused, the window stays open with the message, but its fields show the
values saved before: whatever was just typed or ticked is gone
⚠ [OJS7](#ojs7). <sup>k</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Society name or acronym**, **URL** | No | Under "Journal Information". Meant for the panel's "Society" row, the name linked to the address [OJS5](#ojs5). An address that is not a web address is refused in the window with "Please enter a valid URL." under the box, and nothing is saved. <sup>k</sup> <sup>q15</sup> |
| **Start Date** | No | Under "Exclude by Date": articles submitted before it are meant to get no panel (Rule 19). A date picker (year-month-day); letters cannot be typed. An impossible date such as "2026-99-99" is not refused: "OK" shows "Your changes have been saved." and stores no start date, and the box is empty when the window reopens ⚠ [OJS8](#ojs8). <sup>k</sup> |
| **Directory of Open Access Journals**, **Google Scholar**, **Latindex**, **MEDLINE** | No | Under "Automated Listing of Indexes in the PFL". Each ticked index is meant to be listed under the panel's "Indexed in". The journal's listing in DOAJ, Latindex and MEDLINE is checked against the index on "OK"; a listing the check cannot confirm is refused, in a notice and not beside the box, with "The journal's indexing in {index} could not be verified. Ensure that your journal is indexed and the appropriate ISSN is configured in Journal Settings." <sup>k</sup> <sup>q15</sup> |
| **Scopus** and **Web of Science** "URL" | No | Under "Manual Listing of Indexes in the PFL", each with its steps. A Scopus address must have the form of a Scopus source page, a Web of Science address must start with the Master Journal List's address; otherwise "The Scopus URL you entered is not correct. Please read the instructions and try again." ("The Web of Science URL you entered is not correct. Please read the instructions and try again."). <sup>k</sup> <sup>q15</sup> |

<a id="summary"></a>
**The article summary.** How the listing pages show one article: an
issue's table of contents (*Issues*), a journal's "Latest Publications"
and a preprint server's "Latest preprints" on the home page
([Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), Rules 13 and 16),
a preprint server's "Archives" page (the main menu's "Archives") and
section pages (*Sections*), category
pages (*Categories*) and search results ([Search](U15-search.md), Rule 6).
Top to bottom: <sup>j</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Cover image** | — | The current version's cover image, a link to the article's page (Rule 22). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Title** | — | Title and subtitle, a link to the article's page. <sup>j</sup> |
| **Authors** | — | The author line described in [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md), its Rule 15, left out in an issue's table of contents when the section omits author names {OJS} (Settings bullet 10). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Pages** {OJS} | — | The version's pages, when set. <sup>j</sup> |
| **"DOI:"** {OPS} | — | Meant to show the preprint's DOI as a link; never shows ⚠ [OPS6](#ops6). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Keywords** {OPS} | — | The current version's keywords, one after another, in no fixed order [A11](#a11). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Details line** {OPS} | — | "Downloads: {count} - Submitted {date} - Posted {date}", then " - Versions: {count}" once more than one version is posted. <sup>j</sup> |
| **Date** {OJS} | — | The publication date, on search results only. <sup>j</sup> |
| **Galley links** | — | As on the landing page (Rule 10), except on search results and category pages, which leave them out (Rule 22). |

## Rules & state

1. **The page's address.** The article's page lives at the journal's
   address followed by "article/view/" ("preprint/view/") and the
   article's number, or its **URL Path** once one is set on the Publication
   Settings page (a preprint server's "Preprint entry" page;
   [Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)).
   With a URL Path set, an address that uses the number forwards to the
   URL Path one, keeping any galley or version part that followed the
   number ⚠ [OPS2](#ops2). <sup>f</sup> <sup>q2</sup>
2. **Which version the page shows.** The article's address shows the
   **current version**: the most recently published one. Each older
   published version has an address of its own, reached from the
   "Versions" list (Rule 8): the article's address followed by
   "/version/" and an id the "Versions" link carries, not the version's
   number ("…/version/68" for "Version of Record 1.0"). The current
   version's own such address opens the same page as the article's
   address. A version address naming an id the article has no published
   version under (a mistyped one, or another article's version) answers
   the "404 Not Found" page on a preprint server; on a journal it fails
   with a server error
   ([→ Publish, schedule & versions, OJS3](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#ojs3)).
   <sup>f</sup> <sup>q2</sup>
3. **Nothing published, no page.** While an article has no published
   version (a scheduled article included), its address answers the "404
   Not Found" page to a visitor and to a Reader, and so does the own
   address of any version not yet published. A number or URL Path that
   matches no article of the journal answers the same page. <sup>f</sup>
   <sup>q3</sup>
4. **The preview.** An unpublished version's page opens for those
   Actors row 2 names under the notice "This is a preview and has not
   been published. View submission". It looks as it will once published,
   except that it has no "Published" ("Posted") line and no "Versions"
   list. On a preprint server the label line names the preview day and
   the version's name as it stands ("Preprint / 2026-09-25 (Author
   Original 1.2)"). "View submission" opens the submission's workflow on
   its current stage for those whose workflow offers "Preview"; the
   submission's Author gets the access-denied page instead ("The current
   role does not have access to this operation.") ⚠ [A5](#a5). On a
   preprint server, previewing a new version while an
   earlier one is posted adds the older-version notice of Rule 5 under
   it ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1).
   <sup>f</sup> <sup>q3</sup>
5. **An older version's notice.** An older version's page opens with
   "This is an outdated version published on {date}. Read the most recent
   version.", the date being that version's own; "most recent version"
   opens the article's address. The page is headed with the older
   version's title, but the browser tab reads the current version's
   title ⚠ [A6](#a6).
   <sup>f</sup> <sup>q4</sup>
6. **Empty parts are left out.** Every part of the page's tables appears
   only when the version has something to put in it: an article with only
   a title, one contributor and an abstract shows the breadcrumb, the
   title, the contributor, "Abstract", "Published" and "Versions", on a
   journal also "Section" (and "Issue", with the issue's cover, when it is
   in an issue that has one), and no other heading. The preprint page's
   "References" heading is the exception (Rule 18).
   <sup>c</sup> <sup>q6</sup>
7. **The date line.** Under "Published" ("Posted"): the first
   version's page, its date; a later version's, "{first version's
   date} — Updated on {this version's date}". Creating a new version
   already rewrites both: "{creation day} — Updated on {this version's
   date}"
   ([→ Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#a6)).
   <sup>g</sup> <sup>q5</sup>
8. **The "Versions" list.** Every published version, the newest first,
   each as "{date} ({version name})": "2026-09-24 (Version of Record
   1.0)", on a preprint server "2026-09-24 (Author Original 1.0)". The
   version shown is plain text; the current version links to the
   article's address and each older one to its own address (Rule 2). A
   version not yet published is not listed. On a French page the version
   name reads "##publication.versionStage.display##" ⚠ [A1](#a1).
   <sup>g</sup> <sup>q5</sup>
9. **The label line** {OPS}. Above the title, "Preprint / {date} ({version
   name})" names the shown version, its date and its name as in the
   "Versions" list ([A1](#a1) in French). <sup>g</sup>
10. **The galley links.** The side column lists the shown version's
    galleys, in the order of the "Galleys" page
    ([→ Galleys, ordering](U46-galleys.md#order)), in two lists: first
    the **main galleys**, the remote galleys and those whose file is of a
    main component ("Article Text", "Preprint Text"); then (after a
    journal's "JATS XML" link) the **additional files**, those whose file
    is of a supplementary component ("Data Set", "Other" and the rest,
    Settings bullet 11). A galley whose file's component has since been
    made a dependent one (Settings › Workflow › Submission › "Components",
    the component's "These are dependent files…" box; "Image", "HTML
    Stylesheet" and "Multimedia" are, and the galley upload offers none of
    them), or that has neither a file nor a remote address, is not
    listed. The two lists carry no visible heading; a
    screen reader reads "Downloads" and "Additional Files". <sup>e</sup>
    <sup>q7</sup>
    - 10a. **The link text.** Each link reads the galley's label. When the
      galley's language is not the language the page is shown in, the
      language follows in brackets: "HTML (French (Canada))" on an English
      page, "PDF (anglais)" on a French one. <sup>e</sup>
    - 10b. **The link address.** The article's address followed by the
      galley's URL Path, or its number when it has none; on an older
      version's page, the version's own address followed by the same.
      <sup>e</sup>
11. **Opening a galley.** What a galley link does depends on the file:
    <sup>d</sup> <sup>e</sup> <sup>q8</sup>
    - a PDF opens the PDF reader page (Fields), while "PDF.JS PDF Viewer"
      is on (Settings bullet 1);
    - an HTML file {OJS} opens the HTML reader page (Fields), while "HTML
      Article Galley" is on (Settings bullet 2);
    - an XML file {OJS} opens the journal's page with the article laid out
      by the eLife Lens reader, while "eLife Lens Article Viewer" is on
      (Settings bullet 3); the page's own script fails as it loads, so
      formulas cannot be typeset ⚠ [OJS9](#ojs9);
    - any other file, or one whose reader is switched off, downloads under
      its file name, and the browser stays on the article's page. On a
      preprint server an HTML or XML galley always downloads [OPS4](#ops4);
    - a remote galley takes the browser to its remote address.
12. **The readers and older versions.** The return arrow and the title of
    a reader page open the article's address, whichever version the
    galley belongs to. An older version's galley opens its reader under
    the notice "This is an outdated version published on {date}. Read the
    most recent version.", the date written like "2026-09-25" in the PDF
    reader and like "September 25, 2026" in the HTML reader {OJS}. An older version's
    PDF reader shows no document ("0 of 0" in an empty viewer, no
    message), and its "Download" gets no file: the browser stays on the
    reader page ⚠ [A2](#a2).
    <sup>d</sup> <sup>e</sup> <sup>q9</sup>
13. **Galley addresses.** {OJS} The number address of a galley that has a
    URL Path forwards to its URL Path address; on a preprint server it
    answers the "404 Not Found" page ⚠ [OPS3](#ops3). A galley address
    without a version part that names a galley of an older version only
    (a URL Path changed since) opens the article's page. A galley address
    that names no galley of the article answers the "404 Not Found" page.
    <sup>f</sup> <sup>q10</sup>
14. **The "Keywords:", "DOI:" and category lines follow the shown
    version.** An older version's page shows that version's keywords and
    categories; its DOI line is *DOIs*' rule. <sup>c</sup>
15. **"How to Cite".** The block (Fields) cites the shown version: its
    title, its contributors and the journal's name (on a preprint server
    the server's name, which "APA" prints as "In {server name}"). Where
    the format prints them it adds the journal's abbreviation ("ACS",
    "AMA", "IEEE" and "Vancouver"; the journal's acronym when no
    abbreviation is set), the issue and the pages {OJS}, the shown
    version's date, and the article's address, which "ABNT" and "ACM"
    leave out on a journal and "ACM" on a preprint server. An older
    version's page cites that version's title and date with the article's
    own address. On a later version published ("posted") on another day
    than the first, "APA" adds "(Original work published {year})"; on the
    first version's day it adds nothing. "ABNT" runs a preprint's title
    into the server's name and joins the month to the year ⚠ [A7](#a7). <sup>h</sup> <sup>q11</sup>
    - 15a. **Another format.** "More Citation Formats" opens and closes the
      list; choosing a format replaces the citation in place with that
      format's and closes the list, without leaving the page. A reload
      shows the primary format again.
    - 15b. **A download.** "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" or "BibTeX"
      downloads the citation as a file named after the first 60
      characters of the version's title, each space written "+", ending
      ".ris" or ".bib". The RIS file's dates carry a stray "%" ⚠ [A8](#a8).
    - 15c. **An article outside a published issue** {OJS}. On an article
      published with no issue, or published at once into an issue not yet
      published, the primary citation shows. The other formats and the
      downloads work for the Journal Manager and for a Section Editor or
      Copyeditor assigned to the article; for a visitor, a Reader, the
      Author and an unassigned Section Editor a format changes nothing and
      a download opens a blank page (signed out) or the "404 Not Found"
      page (signed in) [OJS1](#ojs1).
16. **The "How to Cite" settings.** After "OK" (Fields), every article's
    page follows at once: <sup>i</sup> <sup>q12</sup>
    - the chosen "Primary Citation Format" is the citation shown first;
      on a journal an "IEEE" citation shown first opens with its number
      "[1]" ("[1]A. Author, …"), which the same format chosen under "More
      Citation Formats" and a preprint server's page leave out
      ⚠ [OJS11](#ojs11);
    - "More Citation Formats" lists the ticked "Additional Citation
      Formats" alone; with none ticked the button stays and opens nothing
      ⚠ [A9](#a9);
    - "Download Citation" lists the ticked "Downloadable Formats" alone,
      disappearing with its heading when none is ticked;
    - "Publisher Location" is printed only where a format prints a
      publisher's place: no on-screen format prints it for a journal
      article; for a preprint "ABNT", "ACS", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE",
      "Turabian" and "Vancouver" do. The "BibTeX" file carries it on both,
      the RIS file does not.
17. **The "Downloads" chart.** While "Usage statistics display options"
    (Settings bullet 6) is on a chart, the main column carries a section
    headed "Downloads" with a bar or a line chart of the article's
    downloads by month. An article with no downloads yet shows an empty
    chart; the sentence "Download data is not yet available." never
    appears ⚠ [A3](#a3). What counts as a download is *Statistics —
    usage*'s. <sup>l</sup>
<a id="references"></a>
18. **The "References" block.** A section headed "References" lists the
    shown version's references, one paragraph each, in list order, with
    each web address in a reference turned into a link that opens in a
    new tab. It shows each reference's own text, never the structured
    details, and appears whenever the version has references, even after
    the journal switched the References setting off. On a preprint server
    a preprint with no references shows the heading with nothing under it
    ([→ Citations & references, A20](U42-citations-and-references.md#a20)).
    A trailing "." or "," is left out of a link, but an address written
    inside parentheses takes the closing ")" into its link ⚠ [A10](#a10).
    How references are
    captured, and why data citations never show here, is
    [Citations & references](U42-citations-and-references.md)' (its A11).
    <sup>m</sup>
19. **The Publication Facts Label** {OJS}. While the "Publication Facts
    Label plugin" is on (Settings bullet 7), the side column is meant to
    carry, at its foot, a panel titled "Publication Facts" comparing the
    article with the journal's other articles: "Peer reviewers", "Data
    availability", "External funding", "Competing interests", then for
    the journal "Articles accepted", "Days to publication", "Indexed in",
    "Editorial team list", "Society" and "Publisher". An article in a
    section marked "Will not be peer-reviewed", or submitted before the
    plugin's "Start Date", is meant to get none. The panel never appears:
    every article's page opens normally without it ⚠ [OJS5](#ojs5). On a
    French page it would show no labels ⚠ [OJS3](#ojs3). <sup>k</sup>
    <sup>q13</sup>
20. **Recommendations** {OJS}. Under the article:
    <sup>n</sup> <sup>q14</sup>
    - 20a. **"Most read articles by the same author(s)"**, while "Recommend
      Articles by Author" is on (Settings bullet 8): meant to list the
      journal's other published articles by a contributor of the same
      name, the most read first, ten a page. The list never appears: the
      page of an article whose contributor has another published article
      in the journal opens normally without it ⚠ [OJS4](#ojs4). With no
      such article there is no list either, as intended.
    - 20b. **"Similar Articles"**, while "Recommend Similar Articles" is on
      (Settings bullet 9): meant to list the published articles that match
      the article's keywords in the journal's search, ten a page, followed
      by "You may also start an advanced similarity search for this
      article.", whose link runs that search on the Search page. The list
      never appears, even for an article whose keywords a dozen published
      articles share ⚠ [OJS10](#ojs10). An article with no keywords, or no
      match, gets no list either, as intended.
21. **The page in another language.** Every label on the page follows the
    interface language the visitor chose, except on a preprint server's
    French page, whose keywords label reads "##preprint.subject## :"
    where the English page reads "Keywords:" ⚠ [OPS7](#ops7) (and the
    version names of Rule 8). The article's own texts show in that
    language where the version has them. The contributor list, with the role under each
    name, is described in
    [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md).
    <sup>c</sup> <sup>q5</sup>
22. **The article summary** (Fields). The title and cover open the
    article's address; on a preprint server the keyword row runs across
    the middle of the cover, where a press opens nothing ⚠ [OPS9](#ops9).
    On search results and category pages the summary leaves out the
    galleys. An issue's table of contents, the home page's "Current Issue"
    included, lists only the main galleys. A journal's "Latest
    Publications" holds only the articles outside a published issue
    (published with no issue, or into an issue not yet published;
    [Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), its Rule 13),
    so an article in a published issue is listed under that issue
    instead. "Latest Publications" too lists only the main galleys while
    the home page also shows the current issue ("Include the current
    issue's table of contents" under the theme's "Journal Content
    Organization"). Without it,
    and on a preprint server's lists,
    every galley of the current version is shown, one with no file
    included, whose link answers the "404 Not Found" page ⚠ [A4](#a4).
    <sup>j</sup> <sup>q7</sup>

A preprint server can also mark a preprint as published elsewhere, with a
notice above the title; that notice belongs to preprint relations,
outside this spec. <sup>a</sup>

## Side effects

- **Usage statistics.** Each opening of an article's page and each galley
  download or reader opening is recorded for the journal's usage
  statistics (*Statistics — usage*), which the "Downloads" chart and the
  preprint summary's "Downloads: {count}" read once the statistics are
  processed; the test installs never process them. <sup>l</sup>
- **No email, no notice.** Reading the page, opening a galley or
  downloading a citation sends no email and leaves no notice. <sup>b</sup>
- **The citation settings.** "OK" in the "Citation Style Language"
  settings window shows "Your changes have been saved." and changes every
  article's page of the journal at once (Rule 16). <sup>i</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

1. **"PDF.JS PDF Viewer"** (Settings › Website › "Plugins" › "Installed
   Plugins", "Generic Plugins"). On for a new journal and preprint
   server: a PDF galley opens the PDF reader page (Rule 11). Off: it
   downloads. <sup>o</sup> <sup>q16</sup>
2. **{OJS} "HTML Article Galley"** (same list). On for a new journal: an
   HTML galley opens the HTML reader page. Off: it downloads (Rule 11). A
   preprint server has no such plugin. <sup>o</sup>
3. **{OJS} "eLife Lens Article Viewer"** (same list). On for a new
   journal: an XML galley opens in the Lens reader. Off: it downloads
   (Rule 11). A preprint server has no such plugin. <sup>o</sup>
4. **"Citation Style Language"** (same list). Off for a new journal and
   preprint server: no "How to Cite" block. On: the block of Rule 15, and
   the plugin row's "Settings". Ticking the row shows "The plugin
   "Citation Style Language" has been enabled."; unticking asks "Are you
   sure you want to disable this plugin?" ("OK" / "Cancel"), then shows
   "The plugin "Citation Style Language" has been disabled.". The
   plugin's settings are kept while it is off: ticked again, the window
   and the block return as they were left. <sup>o</sup> <sup>i</sup>
5. **The "Citation Style Language" "Settings" window** (bullet 4's
   "Settings"). On a new journal: no primary format chosen (APA shown),
   every additional format and both download formats ticked, no publisher
   location. Each field's effect: Rule 16. <sup>i</sup>
6. **"Usage statistics display options"** (Settings › Website ›
   "Appearance" › "Theme",
   [Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), its Rule 9). "Do
   not display submission usage statistics chart for reader." on a new
   journal: no chart. "Use bar type of the chart for usage statistics
   display." or "Use line type of the chart for usage statistics
   display.": the "Downloads" section of Rule 17. <sup>l</sup>
7. **{OJS} "Publication Facts Label plugin"** (same list as bullet 1). Off
   for a new journal: no panel. On: the panel of Rule 19 (never shown
   [OJS5](#ojs5)), and its "Settings" window (Fields). A section's "Will
   not be peer-reviewed" (Settings › Journal › "Sections", *Sections*),
   unticked on the seeded sections and on a new journal's "Articles", is
   meant to keep the panel off its articles. <sup>o</sup> <sup>k</sup>
8. **{OJS} "Recommend Articles by Author"** (same list). Off for a new
   journal. On: Rule 20a (the list never shown [OJS4](#ojs4)).
   <sup>o</sup>
9. **{OJS} "Recommend Similar Articles"** (same list). Off for a new
   journal. On: Rule 20b (the list never shown [OJS10](#ojs10)).
   <sup>o</sup>
10. **{OJS} A section's "Omit author names for section items from issues'
    table of contents."** (Settings › Journal › "Sections", *Sections*).
    Unticked on the seeded sections and on a new section: the article
    summary carries the author line. Ticked: an issue's table of
    contents, and the home page's "Current Issue", list the section's
    articles without it; "Latest Publications", category pages and search
    results still show it (Fields, the article summary). A preprint
    server's section form has no such box. <sup>j</sup>
11. **A component's "These are supplementary files, such as data sets and
    research materials, and will be displayed separately from the main
    publication files."** (Settings › Workflow › Submission ›
    "Components", the component row's "Settings" › "Edit"). Ticked on a new journal for
    "Research Instrument", "Research Materials", "Research Results",
    "Transcripts", "Data Analysis", "Data Set", "Source Texts",
    "Multimedia" and "Other"; a galley of such a component is listed under
    the additional files (Rule 10). "Multimedia" is also a dependent
    component, which the galley upload never offers. <sup>e</sup>
12. **Settings other features describe.** The journal's publishing mode,
    subscriptions and article access (*Subscriptions & open access
    control*), "Enable Public Comments"
    ([Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md)),
    a version's public JATS XML (*JATS & Body Text*), the DOI settings and
    the Crossref plugin (*DOIs*), and the URN plugin
    ([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)) each add or gate a part of this
    page; their rules are there.

## Cross-feature interactions

  "Data Availability Statement" and "Funding Statement" blocks (its Rule
  15); this spec shows the keywords, abstract and plain language summary.
- **[Citations & references](U42-citations-and-references.md)**: captures
  the references the "References" block shows (Rule 18); its A20 is the
  preprint page's empty heading.

  publishing, scheduling, "Create New Version", the version names, and the
  "URL Path" and "Cover Image" fields of the Publication Settings page;
  its A6 and OJS3 are about this page.
- **[Workflow screen & stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md)**:
  the workflow header's "View" and "Preview", which open this page (its
  Rule 6).
- **[Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md)**:
  the comments blocks on a journal's page.
- **[Search](U15-search.md)**, **[Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md)**:
  the search results and the home page lists that print the article
  summary; the theme's chart choice.
- **[Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md)**:
  the journal abbreviation some citation formats print; a journal closed
  to signed-out visitors.
- *Monograph landing page* (no spec yet): the press's counterpart.
- *DOIs* (no spec yet): the DOI line and the Crossmark button.
- *Issues*, *Sections*, *Categories* (no specs yet): the table of
  contents, section pages and category pages that list articles.

## Canonical scenarios

Every scenario reads articles published for it. Scenarios 1 and 4 run on
the seeded journal (preprint server), scenario 4 with ready accounts; the
others run on scratch journals (preprint servers) with throwaway
accounts. The accounts, their passwords and the tooling recipe are in the
footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **A published article's page**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, and two articles published on the
   seeded journal (preprint server): "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters",
   in the issue "Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)" and the section "Articles" (the
   section "Preprints" on a preprint server), with the subtitle "A field
   study", the keywords "tide" and "current", an abstract, the plain
   language summary "How tides move along a coast.", a cover image, the
   category "Engineering" (a subcategory of "Applied Science"), on a
   journal the article number "e42", the two references "Smith, J.
   (2020). Ridge data. https://example.org/ridge." and "Jones, K. (2021).
   Coastal survey.", and a galley "PDF"; and "Harbour Notes", in no
   issue, with only a title, one contributor and an abstract.

   - **The main column**: open "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters" at
     {journal address}/article/view/{number} ("preprint/view/" on a
     preprint server; {number} is the article's number). The breadcrumb
     reads "Home / Archives / Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014) / Articles", with
     "Home", "Archives" and "Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)" as links ("Home /
     Preprints" on a preprint server). On a preprint server a label line
     above the title reads "Preprint / " followed by the date and the
     version name of the "Versions" entry in the side column. The page is
     headed "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters", with "A field study"
     under it; below the contributors come "Keywords: tide, current" or
     "Keywords: current, tide" (either order passes, [A11](#a11)) as
     plain text, "Abstract" with the abstract, and "Plain Language
     Summary" with "How tides move along a coast." (Fields, the landing
     page; Rules 6, 9).
   - **"References"**: further down, a section headed "References" lists
     "Smith, J. (2020). Ridge data. https://example.org/ridge." and
     "Jones, K. (2021). Coastal survey." as two paragraphs, in that
     order. "https://example.org/ridge" is a link that opens in a new
     tab, and the final "." is not part of it (Rule 18).
   - **The side column**: top to bottom it shows the cover image, the
     galley link "PDF", "Published" ("Posted" on a preprint server) over
     a date, and "Versions" with one entry, "{that date} (Version of
     Record 1.0)" ("Author Original 1.0" on a preprint server), as plain
     text; on a journal then "Issue" with "Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)" as a link
     and "Section" with "Articles" as plain text; then "Categories" with
     "Engineering" as a link ("Applied Science > Engineering" on a
     preprint server); and on a journal "Article Number" with "e42" as
     plain text (Fields, the side column; Rule 8).
   - **The links in the side column**: on a journal, press "Vol. 1 No. 2
     (2014)" under "Issue": the issue's page opens. Back on the article,
     press the category under "Categories": that category's page opens
     (Fields, the side column).
   - **An article with little in it**: open "Harbour Notes": the page
     shows the breadcrumb ("Home / Archives / Articles" on a journal, the
     issue left out), the title, the contributor, "Abstract", "Published"
     ("Posted") and "Versions", on a journal also "Section", and no other
     heading; a preprint server also shows the "References" heading
     (Rule 6; Fields, "Breadcrumb").
   - **Control**: "Harbour Notes" shows no "Keywords:", no "Plain Language
     Summary", no "Categories" and no cover image, all of which "Tidal
     Patterns in Coastal Waters" shows (Rule 6). <sup>s</sup>

2. **Opening each galley**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   at its install settings, with two published articles: "Tidal
   Patterns", carrying the galleys "PDF" (the file "article.pdf", with
   the URL Path "pdf"), "HTML" (the file "article.html"), on a journal
   "XML" (the file "article.xml"), "Remote" (hosted at
   "https://example.org/paper") and "Data" (the file "notes.md", of the
   component "Data Set"), the files on a preprint server being
   "preprint.pdf", "preprint.html" and "not-an-image.txt"; and "Harbour
   Currents", with the URL Path "harbour-currents" and a galley "PDF" of
   its own, with no URL Path.

   - **The two lists**: open "Tidal Patterns" at {journal
     address}/article/view/{number} ("preprint/view/" on a preprint
     server): the side column lists "PDF", "HTML", on a journal "XML",
     and "Remote" in one list, then "Data" alone in a second list below
     it. Neither list has a visible heading; a screen reader reads
     "Downloads" over the first and "Additional Files" over the second.
     The "PDF" link's address is the article's address followed by
     "/pdf", the "HTML" link's the article's address followed by "/" and
     a number (Rules 10, 10b).
   - **The PDF reader**: press "PDF": the PDF reader page opens. A bar
     across the top holds an arrow, the title "Tidal Patterns" and a
     "Download" button, which a screen reader reads "Download PDF"; under
     it the PDF fills the page in a viewer with its own page, zoom,
     search and print controls. The browser tab reads "View of Tidal
     Patterns". Press "Download": "article.pdf" ("preprint.pdf")
     downloads. Press the title: the article's page opens. Go back and
     press the arrow: the article's page opens again (Fields, the PDF
     reader page; Rules 11, 12).
   - **The HTML galley**: on a journal, press "HTML": the HTML reader
     page opens, with the same bar holding the arrow, which a screen
     reader reads "Return to Article Details", and the title, no
     "Download", and the HTML full text under it; press the arrow: the
     article's page opens. On a preprint server "HTML" downloads
     "preprint.html" and the browser stays on the preprint's page
     ([OPS4](#ops4)) (Fields, the HTML reader page; Rule 11).
   - **The XML galley** {OJS}: press "XML": a page of the journal opens
     with the article of "article.xml" laid out by the eLife Lens reader,
     its text showing ([OJS9](#ojs9)) (Rule 11).
   - **A file with no reader**: press "Data": "notes.md"
     ("not-an-image.txt") downloads, and the browser stays on the
     article's page (Rule 11).
   - **The remote galley**: press "Remote": the browser goes to
     "https://example.org/paper" (Rule 11).
   - **No such galley**: type the article's address followed by
     "/nosuchgalley": the "404 Not Found" page (Rule 13).
   - **An article's URL Path**: type {journal address}/article/view/{number}
     with "Harbour Currents"'s number ("preprint/view/" on a preprint
     server): the browser lands on {journal
     address}/article/view/harbour-currents, that article's page. On a
     journal, its "PDF" link's address reads {journal
     address}/article/view/harbour-currents/ followed by a number; type
     {journal address}/article/view/{number}/ followed by that number:
     the browser lands on the "PDF" link's address, and the PDF reader
     page opens ([OPS2](#ops2)) (Rule 1).
   - **Control**: "Tidal Patterns", which has no URL Path, stays at its
     number address (Rule 1). <sup>s</sup>

3. **An older version beside the current one**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   with "Citation Style Language" on, and an article published twice,
   both times today ({today} below, the day the scenario runs): its
   first version, titled "Tidal Patterns", on a journal in the published
   issue "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)", and its current version, titled "Tidal
   Patterns Revised"; each version carries a galley "PDF" and, on a
   journal, a galley "HTML".

   - **The current version's page**: open the article's address: the
     page is headed "Tidal Patterns Revised", and under "Published"
     ("Posted") reads "{today} — Updated on {today}". "Versions" lists
     two entries, the newest first: the current version's as plain
     text, then "{today} (Version of Record 1.0)" ("Author Original 1.0"
     on a preprint server) as a link. On a preprint server the label
     line above the title reads "Preprint / " followed by the date and
     name of the current version's entry. The "APA" citation under "How
     to Cite" names "Tidal Patterns Revised" (Rules 7, 8, 9, 15).
   - **The older version's page**: press "{today} (Version of Record
     1.0)": the address is the article's address followed by "/version/"
     and a number, and the page opens under "This is an outdated version
     published on {today}. Read the most recent version.", headed "Tidal
     Patterns". In "Versions" that entry is now plain text and the
     current version's a link. The "PDF" link's address begins with this
     page's address. "How to Cite" cites "Tidal Patterns" with the
     article's own address, which has no "/version/" in it (Rules 2, 5,
     8, 10b, 15).
   - **"most recent version"**: press "most recent version" in the
     notice: the article's address opens, headed "Tidal Patterns
     Revised" (Rule 5).
   - **The older version's PDF reader**: go back to the older version's
     page and press "PDF": the PDF reader page shows the title "Tidal
     Patterns" and, between the bar and the viewer, "This is an outdated
     version published on {today}. Read the most recent version.", the
     date written like "2026-09-25" ([A2](#a2)). Press the arrow: the
     article's address opens (Rule 12; Fields, the PDF reader page).
   - **The older version's HTML reader** {OJS}: on the older version's
     page press "HTML": the HTML reader page shows the same notice with
     the date written like "September 25, 2026", and its bar reads the
     current version's title, "Tidal Patterns Revised". Press the title:
     the article's address opens (Rule 12; Fields, the HTML reader page).
   - **A version that does not exist** {OPS}: type the article's address
     followed by "/version/999999": the "404 Not Found" page. A journal
     fails there with a server error instead
     ([→ Publish, schedule & versions, OJS3](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#ojs3))
     (Rule 2).
   - **The home page's summary** {OPS}: on the preprint server's home
     page, the preprint's summary under "Latest preprints" ends its
     details line with " - Versions: 2" (Fields, the article summary).
   - **Control**: the article's address shows no "This is an outdated
     version…" notice (Rule 5). <sup>s</sup>

4. **An unpublished article: the preview, and "404 Not Found" for
   everyone else**

   Given: the Journal Manager, the Author, the Reader and a visitor,
   signed out, on the seeded journal (preprint server), with the
   Author's article "Tidal Draft" submitted and in Production, never
   published ({number} below is its number), and, on a journal, an
   article scheduled into the unpublished issue "Vol. 2 No. 1 (2015)".

   - **The visitor**: open {journal address}/article/view/{number}
     ("preprint/view/" on a preprint server): the "404 Not Found" page.
     On a journal the scheduled article's address answers the same, and
     so, on both, does {journal address}/article/view/no-such-article
     (Rule 3; Actors row 2).
   - **The Reader**: signed in, the Reader opens the same addresses:
     "404 Not Found" each time (Rule 3; Actors row 2).
   - **The Journal Manager's "Preview"**: open "Tidal Draft" from the
     Dashboard and press "Preview" in the workflow's header: the
     article's page opens under "This is a preview and has not been
     published. View submission", headed "Tidal Draft", with no
     "Published" ("Posted") line and no "Versions" list (Rule 4; Actors
     row 2).
   - **"View submission"**: press "View submission": the article's
     workflow opens on its current stage, Production (Rule 4).
   - **The Author**: signed in, the Author opens "Tidal Draft" with
     "View" on My Submissions: its workflow offers no "Preview". The
     Author types the article's address: the same preview opens, under
     the same notice ([A5](#a5)) (Actors row 2; Rule 4).
   - **Control**: the address the Journal Manager's "Preview" opened is
     {journal address}/article/view/{number}, the address that answered
     "404 Not Found" to the visitor and the Reader (Rules 3, 4).
     <sup>s</sup>

5. **A journal closed to visitors**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, and two scratch journals (preprint
   servers), each with a Reader and a published article "Tidal
   Patterns" carrying a galley "PDF" with the URL Path "pdf": one that
   the Site Administrator has not enabled, and one that requires
   visitors to sign in ("Users must be registered and log in to view the
   journal site." ticked; "…to view the server site." on a preprint
   server).

   - **The journal not enabled**: the visitor opens the article's
     address: the Login page. The visitor opens the article's address
     followed by "/pdf", the galley's address: the Login page again
     (Actors, opening paragraph; Rule 10b).
   - **Its Reader**: the journal's Reader signs in and opens the
     article's address: the page headed "Tidal Patterns"; "PDF" opens
     the PDF reader page (Actors, opening paragraph; Rule 11).
   - **The journal that requires sign-in**: the visitor opens the same
     two addresses on the second journal: the Login page each time. That
     journal's Reader signs in and opens the article's address: the page
     headed "Tidal Patterns"; "PDF" opens the PDF reader page (Actors,
     opening paragraph).
   - **Control**: on each journal the Reader reads the article at the
     address that sent the visitor to Login (Actors, opening paragraph).
     <sup>s</sup>

6. **"How to Cite": another format, a download and the settings window**

   Given: the Journal Manager, and a visitor, signed out, in a second
   browser, on a scratch journal named "Coastal Review" (a scratch
   preprint server named "Coastal Preprints") with "Citation Style
   Language" on and its "Settings" window never saved, and the article
   "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters" published there, on a journal in
   the published issue "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)".

   - **The citation**: the visitor opens the article's page: the side
     column (at its foot on a journal) shows "How to Cite" over an "APA"
     citation naming "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters", "Coastal
     Review" ("In Coastal Preprints" on a preprint server) and the
     article's address (Fields, "How to Cite"; Rule 15).
   - **"More Citation Formats"**: press it: a list opens with "ABNT",
     "ACM", "ACS", "AMA", "APA", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "MLA",
     "Turabian" and "Vancouver", and under them "Download Citation" with
     "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" and "BibTeX". Press "More Citation
     Formats" again: the list closes (Rule 15a).
   - **Another format**: press "More Citation Formats" and choose "IEEE":
     the citation changes in place to another text, the list closes and
     the browser's address stays the same; note the IEEE text. Reload
     the page: the "APA" citation shows again (Rule 15a).
   - **A download**: press "More Citation Formats" and "BibTeX": the
     file "Tidal+Patterns+in+Coastal+Waters.bib" downloads. Press "More
     Citation Formats" and "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)": the file
     "Tidal+Patterns+in+Coastal+Waters.ris" downloads ([A8](#a8))
     (Rule 15b).
   - **No email**: the mail catcher holds no email to the journal's
     accounts from the visitor's steps (Side effects).
   - **The settings window**: the Journal Manager opens Settings ›
     Website › "Plugins" › "Installed Plugins" and presses the "Citation
     Style Language" row's "Settings": "Primary Citation Format" has no
     format chosen, every box under "Additional Citation Formats" is
     ticked, both boxes under "Downloadable Formats" are ticked and
     "Publisher Location" is empty (Fields, the settings window;
     Settings bullet 5).
   - **"Cancel"**: choose "IEEE" under "Primary Citation Format" and press
     "Cancel": the window closes without a question. Press "Settings"
     again: no format is chosen (Fields, "OK / Cancel").
   - **"Close" after a change**: choose "IEEE" and press the window's
     "Close": it asks "The data on this form has changed. Do you wish to
     continue without saving?"; confirm it. Press "Settings" again: no
     format is chosen (Fields, "OK / Cancel").
   - **"OK"**: choose "IEEE", untick every "Additional Citation Formats"
     box but "MLA", untick "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)", type "London,
     U.K." in "Publisher Location" and press "OK": the window closes and
     "Your changes have been saved." shows (Fields, "OK / Cancel"; Side
     effects).
   - **The visitor's page after "OK"**: the visitor reloads the article's
     page: "How to Cite" shows the IEEE citation noted earlier, on a
     journal with "[1]" before it ([OJS11](#ojs11)), on a preprint
     server now with "London, U.K." in it. "More Citation
     Formats" lists "MLA" alone, and "Download Citation" "BibTeX" alone.
     On a journal neither the IEEE nor the "MLA" citation prints
     "London, U.K."; on both, the "BibTeX" file carries it (Rule 16).
   - **Switching the plugin off**: the Journal Manager unticks the
     "Citation Style Language" row: it asks "Are you sure you want to
     disable this plugin?"; press "OK": "The plugin "Citation Style
     Language" has been disabled." shows and the row offers no
     "Settings". The visitor reloads the article's page: it has no "How
     to Cite" (Settings bullet 4; Fields, the settings window).
   - **Switching it on again**: the Journal Manager ticks the row: "The
     plugin "Citation Style Language" has been enabled." shows. The
     visitor reloads: "How to Cite" shows the IEEE citation again
     (Settings bullet 4).
   - **Control**: "More Citation Formats" still lists "MLA" alone: the
     settings were kept while the plugin was off (Settings bullet 4).
     <sup>s</sup>

7. **The PDF viewer switched off, and the downloads chart**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   with "PDF.JS PDF Viewer" off and "Usage statistics display options"
   set to "Use bar type of the chart for usage statistics display.", and
   a published article "Tidal Patterns" carrying a galley "PDF" (the
   file "article.pdf"; "preprint.pdf" on a preprint server).

   - **"PDF" with the viewer off**: open the article's page and press
     "PDF": "article.pdf" ("preprint.pdf") downloads, and the browser
     stays on the article's page (Settings bullet 1; Rule 11).
   - **The "Downloads" chart**: the main column carries a section headed
     "Downloads" with an empty chart, since the test install never
     counts the downloads ([A3](#a3)) (Rule 17; Side effects).
   - **Control**: the seeded journal, at the install default "Do not
     display submission usage statistics chart for reader.", shows no
     "Downloads" section on scenario 1's article pages (Settings
     bullet 6). <sup>s</sup>

8. **The page in French**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   with French (Canada) among its interface and submission languages,
   and a published article titled "Tidal Patterns" in English and
   "Motifs des marées" in French, with an abstract in each language,
   the keyword "tide" in English and "marée" in French, and two
   galleys: "PDF" in English and "HTML" in French (Canada).

   - **The English page**: open {journal address}/en/article/view/{number}
     ("preprint/view/" on a preprint server): the page is headed "Tidal
     Patterns", its keywords read "Keywords: tide", and the galley links
     read "PDF" and "HTML (French (Canada))" (Rules 10a, 21).
   - **The French page**: open {journal
     address}/fr_CA/article/view/{number}: the page is headed "Motifs des
     marées", with the French abstract under its heading; on a journal
     the keywords read "Mots-clés : marée" ([OPS7](#ops7)); the galley
     links read "PDF (anglais)" and "HTML" (Rules 10a, 21).
   - **The French PDF reader** {OJS}: press "PDF (anglais)": the
     browser tab reads "Vue de Motifs des marées" ([OPS8](#ops8))
     (Fields, the PDF reader page).
   - **Control**: open {journal address}/en/article/view/{number} again:
     the page is headed "Tidal Patterns", and its galley links read "PDF"
     and "HTML (French (Canada))" once more (Rule 21). <sup>s</sup>

9. **The article summary on a journal's lists** {OJS}

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal whose home page
   shows the current issue ("Include the current issue's table of
   contents" ticked under the theme's "Journal Content Organization"),
   with the category "Oceans" and the published
   issue "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)", which has a cover image; two articles are
   published in that issue: "Tidal Patterns", with the subtitle "A field
   study", a cover image of its own, the category "Oceans" and the
   galleys "PDF" (of the component "Article Text") and "Data" (of the
   component "Data Set"), and "Harbour Currents", with no cover image of
   its own.

   - **The issue's cover on an article's page**: open "Harbour
     Currents": the side column shows the issue's cover image as a link;
     press it: the issue's page opens (Fields, the side column, "Cover
     image").
   - **The issue's table of contents**: on the issue's page, "Tidal
     Patterns" is listed with its own cover image, the title "Tidal
     Patterns" with "A field study", the author line and the galley link
     "PDF", with no "Data". Press the title: the article's page opens. Go
     back and press the cover image: the article's page opens again
     (Fields, the article summary; Rule 22).
   - **"Current Issue"**: press "Home" in the breadcrumb: on the home
     page "Tidal Patterns" is listed under "Current Issue" with "PDF" and
     no "Data" (Rule 22).
   - **A category page**: on the article's page press "Oceans" under
     "Categories": the category's page lists "Tidal Patterns" with its
     title and cover image and no galley link (Rule 22).
   - **Control**: the article's own page lists "PDF" and, in a second
     list below it, "Data" (Rule 10). <sup>s</sup>

10. **The preprint summary on a preprint server's lists** {OPS}

    Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch preprint server with the
    category "Oceans", and a preprint posted once today ({today} below),
    "Tidal Patterns", with the subtitle "A field study", a cover image,
    the keywords "tide" and "current", the category "Oceans" and a
    galley "PDF".

    - **"Latest preprints"**: open the server's home page: "Tidal
      Patterns" is listed under "Latest preprints" with its cover image,
      the title with "A field study", the author line, the keywords
      "tide" and "current" in either order ([A11](#a11)), the line "Downloads: 0 - Submitted {today} -
      Posted {today}" and the galley link "PDF" ([OPS6](#ops6)). Press
      the title: the preprint's page opens (Fields, the article summary;
      Rule 22; Side effects).
    - **"Archives"**: press "Archives" in the main menu: the "Archives"
      page lists the same summary (Fields, the article summary).
    - **A category page**: on the preprint's page press "Oceans" under
      "Categories": the category's page lists "Tidal Patterns" with no
      galley link (Rule 22).
    - **Control**: the details line ends at "Posted {today}", with no " -
      Versions:" part, the preprint having one version posted (Fields,
      the article summary). <sup>s</sup>

## Coverage

Left out of the scenarios above, by reason:

- **Budget** — states:
  - a galley whose component was made a dependent one after the galley
    was built, which the page no longer lists (Rule 10; Settings
    bullet 11)
- **Budget** — variants:
  - a section's "Omit author names for section items from issues' table
    of contents." ticked {OJS}: the table of contents and "Current
    Issue" without the author line, the other lists with it (Settings
    bullet 10)
  - "HTML Article Galley" off {OJS}: an HTML galley downloads (Settings
    bullet 2; Rule 11)
  - "eLife Lens Article Viewer" off {OJS}: an XML galley downloads
    (Settings bullet 3; Rule 11)
  - the number address of a galley that has a URL Path, forwarding to
    the URL Path address {OJS}; the page shows no such galley's number
    (Rule 13)
  - the current version at its own version address, the same page as
    the article's address; no link on the page carries the current
    version's id (Rules 2, 8)
  - the "Publication Facts Label plugin" settings window {OJS}: the
    society, the start date and the indexes (Fields, the settings
    window; Settings bullet 7)
  - "Usage statistics display options" set to "Use line type of the
    chart for usage statistics display.": the "Downloads" section with a
    line chart; scenario 7 reads the bar chart (Settings bullet 6;
    Rule 17)
  - an article outside a published issue under a journal's "Latest
    Publications" {OJS}, its main galleys only while the home page also
    shows the current issue; scenario 9 reads the same filter under
    "Current Issue" (Rule 22)
  - a later version published ("posted") on another day than the
    first, whose "APA" citation adds "(Original work published
    {year})"; scenario 3's two versions share a day (Rule 15)
- **Nothing new to test**:
  - a signed-in Reader on a published article's page, the page the
    visitor of scenario 1 reads (Actors, opening paragraph; Actors
    row 1)
  - a component's supplementary box changed, the listing scenario 2's
    "Data" galley already shows (Settings bullet 11; Rule 10)
- **Register carries it**:
  - A5 (the Author's "View submission" on the preview; Rule 4;
    scenario 4 passes it)
  - OPS1 (a preprint server's preview of a new version with both
    notices; Rule 4)
  - OJS1 (other citation formats and downloads outside a published
    issue, by who is signed in {OJS}; Rule 15c)
  - A7 and A8 (the "ABNT" citation and the RIS file's dates; Rules 15,
    15b)
  - A9 (no "Additional Citation Formats" ticked, "More Citation
    Formats" opening nothing; Rule 16)
  - OJS11 (the number "[1]" before a journal's IEEE citation shown
    first {OJS}; Rule 16; scenario 6 passes it)
  - A6 (an older version's browser tab; Rule 5)
  - A2 (an older version's PDF reader showing no document, its
    "Download" getting no file; Rule 12; scenario 3 passes it)
  - OJS9 (the Lens page's failing script {OJS}; Rule 11)
  - OJS6 and OPS5 (the PDF reader's return arrow read to screen
    readers; Fields, the PDF reader page)
  - OPS8 (the PDF reader's browser tab on a preprint server's French
    page; Fields, the PDF reader page)
  - OPS2 (a preprint with a URL Path losing the galley or version part
    of its number address; Rule 1)
  - OPS3 (a galley's number address answering "404 Not Found" on a
    preprint server; Rule 13)
  - A10 (an address in parentheses in a reference; Rule 18)
  - A11 (keywords shown in another order than typed; Fields, the
    landing page and the article summary; scenarios 1 and 10 accept
    either order)
  - A1 and OPS7 (the version names on a French page, and the
    preprint's French keywords label; Rules 8, 9, 21)
  - A4 (a galley with no file, and the additional files, in a preprint
    server's lists and in a journal's "Latest Publications" without the
    current issue; Rule 22)
  - OPS9 (a press on the middle of a preprint's cover in a list;
    Rule 22)
  - OPS6 (the preprint summary's "DOI:" line; Fields, the article
    summary)
  - A3 (the empty chart without "Download data is not yet
    available."; Rule 17)
  - OJS5 ("Publication Facts Label plugin" on, and a section marked
    "Will not be peer-reviewed", with no panel either way {OJS};
    Rule 19; Settings bullet 7)
  - OJS7 and OJS8 (the Publication Facts settings window after a
    refused "OK", and an impossible "Start Date" {OJS}; Fields, the
    settings window)
  - OJS2 and OJS3 (the Publication Facts settings window's warning, and
    the panel's French labels {OJS}; Fields, the settings window;
    Rule 19)
  - OJS4 ("Recommend Articles by Author" on {OJS}; Rule 20a; Settings
    bullet 8)
  - OJS10 ("Recommend Similar Articles" on {OJS}; Rule 20b; Settings
    bullet 9)
- **No seed**:
  - the "DOI:" line of a version with a DOI (Fields, the landing page;
    Rule 14)
- **Owned by another feature**:
  - a visitor opening a galley on a journal with subscriptions (Actors
    row 3; *Subscriptions & open access control*)
  - commenting on the article {OJS} (Actors row 6;
    [Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md),
    scenario 8)
  - a journal's version address naming no version of the article, which
    fails with a server error (Rule 2;
    [Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#ojs3),
    its OJS3)
  - the empty "References" heading on a preprint page with no
    references (Rule 18;
    [Citations & references](U42-citations-and-references.md#a20), its
    A20)
  - which articles a journal's "Latest Publications" holds {OJS}
    (Rule 22; [Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md),
    scenario 9)
  - usage recorded for each page opening and download (Side effects;
    *Statistics — usage*)
  - the publishing mode, subscriptions, public comments, a public JATS
    XML, DOIs and URN (Settings bullet 12; the features it names)
  - a press's book page, this page's counterpart on a press (Purpose;
    *Monograph landing page*)

**A1 — Version names show a raw key in French** · 🐞 · user-visible.
On a page shown in French, the "Versions" list reads "2026-09-24
(##publication.versionStage.display##)" where the English page reads
"2026-09-24 (Version of Record 1.0)", and the preprint page's label line
reads "Prépublication / 2026-09-24 (##publication.versionStage.display##)".
A French reader cannot tell the versions apart by name. The French
interface has no text for the version name at all.

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — An older version's PDF cannot be read** · 🐞 · user-visible · crash: script.
An older version's page lists that version's galleys, and its PDF link
opens the PDF reader page with the outdated-version notice. The reader,
though, asks for the file at the current version's address, where the
older galley does not exist: the viewer fails to load it and shows an
empty page reading "0 of 0" with no message, and "Download" gets no
file, the browser staying on the reader page. A reader who wants the
version they cite cannot read it. When the galley kept its URL Path into
the new version, the reader shows the document, because the copy shares
the published galley's file ([→ Galleys, A4](U46-galleys.md#a4)); once
the current version's galley with that URL Path has a file of its own,
the older version's reader again shows nothing.

**A3 — No sentence for an article without downloads** · ❓ · minor.
With a chart chosen, an article nobody has downloaded yet shows the
"Downloads" heading over an empty chart. The page carries the sentence
"Download data is not yet available." for that case, but it never
appears.
Question: should an article with no downloads show the sentence instead
of an empty chart? Lean: yes; the sentence exists for exactly this case.

**A4 — A galley with no file is offered in listings** · 🐞 · minor.
An article's page leaves out a galley that has no file (its upload never
finished), and so does an issue's table of contents. A preprint server's
lists, and a journal's "Latest Publications" when the home page does not
also show the current issue, show it as a link like any other, and the
link answers the "404 Not Found" page. Those lists also show the
additional files beside the main galleys.

**A5 — "View submission" refuses the Author** · 🐞 · user-visible.
The submission's Author, who opens the preview of an unpublished version
by typing its address (Actors row 2), presses the preview notice's "View
submission" and gets the access-denied page ("The current role does not

**A6 — An older version's browser tab names the current version** · 🐞 · minor.
An older version's page is headed with that version's title, but the
browser tab, and a bookmark made from it, reads the current version's

publication, publishing and scheduling included, can store them in the

saves in a row on the publication's Metadata page kept the typed order,

On an article published with no issue (the journal's continuous
publication), or published at once into an issue that is not yet
published ("Assign To Future Issue and Publish Immediately"), "How to
Cite" shows the primary citation. For a visitor who is not signed in,
choosing a format under "More Citation Formats" leaves the citation
unchanged with no message, and "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" and
"BibTeX" open a blank page: the app fails on the server for both. A
signed-in Reader, Author or Section Editor not assigned to the article
gets the same unchanged citation, and the downloads show "404 Not
Found". A Journal Manager, and a Section Editor or Copyeditor assigned to
the article, get the other formats and the files. All of it works on an

Previewing a new, unposted version of a posted preprint shows "This is a
preview and has not been published. View submission" and under it "This

Once a preprint has a URL Path, an address that uses its number forwards
to the URL Path address but drops what came after the number's slot: a
galley address lands on the preprint's page, a version address answers
"404 Not Found". Every galley that downloads (an HTML file, any file with
no reader) passes through such an address, so on that preprint those
galley links answer the "404 Not Found" page. A journal keeps the rest of
the address.

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

Code read 2026-09-24 at the checkouts' tips (`checkouts/ojs`,
`checkouts/ops`, each with its `lib/pkp`; `checkouts/omp` for the
counterpart only). The two apps' landing pages are app-side copies
(RUNBOOK multi-app rule 7), so every shared claim here needed a probe on
both. Every claim was then driven between 2026-09-24 and 2026-09-25 on
scratch journals and preprint servers, signed out and as the roles each
note names, with a scratch press as the read-only control for the claims
a press does not share; notes q1 to q16 held the author's open questions
before the drive and now record what the screens showed.

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — The page: OJS `templates/frontend/pages/article.tpl` with
`templates/frontend/objects/article_details.tpl`, served by
`pages/article/ArticleHandler.php`; OPS `templates/frontend/pages/preprint.tpl`
with `templates/frontend/objects/preprint_details.tpl`, served by
`pages/preprint/PreprintHandler.php`. No lib/pkp class is shared between
the two handlers. The blocks other features describe are rendered by the
same templates (contributors, statements, funders, pubIds, license) or
added by plugins through `Templates::Article::Details` (Crossref's
Crossmark button, `CrossrefPlugin::displayCrossmarkButton()`). OPS's
relation notice: `preprint_details.tpl`, `relationStatus ==
PUBLICATION_RELATION_PUBLISHED`, texts `publication.relation.published`
"This preprint has been published elsewhere." and
`publication.relation.vorDoi` "DOI of the published preprint"; out of
scope (preprint relations). OMP's book page is `pages/catalog/CatalogBookHandler`
with `monograph_full.tpl`, the counterpart feature.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Purpose), OJS and OPS: a published article's
page was reached from an issue's table of contents, the home page, a
category page, search results and its typed address; its PDF opened the
reader page and a text galley downloaded; the preprint page read
"Posted". The comments blocks showed on a journal only (none on a
preprint page with public comments on). After "Make available with
publication" on the JATS XML page, "JATS XML" sat in the journal's side
column between the main galleys and the additional files; a preprint
server has no JATS XML page. With Crossref chosen and its "Enable
participation in Crossmark…" ticked on Distribution › DOIs ›
"Registration", the Crossmark button showed last in the journal's side
column, after "URN"; a preprint server's Crossref "Registration" tab has
no Crossmark box. The relation notice read "This preprint has been
published elsewhere. DOI of the published preprint
https://doi.org/10.1234/elsewhere" above the label line. OMP control: a
published book has no article page (its number under `article/view/`
answered "404 Not Found"); its page is `catalog/book/{id}`.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — Access: `ArticleHandler::initialize()` answers
`NotFoundHttpException` when no submission matches, and when the requested
publication is not `STATUS_PUBLISHED` and the user is absent or fails
`Repo::submission()->canPreview()`; `ArticleHandler::authorize()` adds
`OjsJournalMustPublishPolicy` ("This journal does not publish its content
online." under publishing mode none) and galley access runs through
`ArticleHandler::userCanViewGalley()` (subscriptions, purchases, the
journal's article-access restriction: *Subscriptions & open access
control*). OPS: `PreprintHandler::initialize()`, `OpsServerMustPublishPolicy`,
`PreprintHandler::userCanViewGalley()` (published, or `canPreview()`). The
page's only per-user content is the comments component
(`UserCommentComponent`, `enablePublicComments`). `view()` and
`download()` send no mail; they fire `UsageEvent` only. The closed
journal: `manager.setup.restrictSiteAccess` "Users must be registered
and log in to view the journal site." (OPS "…to view the server site.")
and the context's enabled flag.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Actors preamble, rows 2–6; Side effects), OJS
and OPS: with "Users must be registered…" ticked, a signed-out visitor
typing a published article's address or its galley's address landed on
Login, and the journal's Reader read the page; with the journal
un-enabled by the Site Administrator ("Enable this journal to appear
publicly on the site"), the visitor landed on Login and the Reader still
read the article. The Journal Manager, the Site Administrator and the
assigned Section Editor (Moderator) opened an unpublished article's
preview, their workflow offering "Preview"; the submission's Author
opened it by typing the address, the Author's workflow offering none; a
visitor, the Reader and a Reviewer (OJS) got "404 Not Found". Signed out
and as the Reader, "PDF" opened the reader and its "Download" saved the
file; "More Citation Formats" › "MLA" replaced the citation and
"BibTeX" downloaded. The Journal Manager reached Settings › Website ›
"Plugins"; the Section Editor (Moderator), the Author and the Reader got
the access-denied page there. Reading the page, a format, a citation
download, the PDF reader and its "Download" left the mail catcher's
counts for the manager, the author, the section editor and the Reader,
and the manager's and the author's "Tasks" counts, unchanged.

OPS: on an English page the lists read "PDF", "HTML (French (Canada))",
"Remote", then "Data", "Notes"; on a French page "PDF (anglais)", "Data
(anglais)", "Remote (anglais)" and plain "HTML" for the French galley.
Addresses: `…/view/{number}/{galley number}`, `…/view/{number}/pdf` for
a galley URL Path, `…/view/probe-path/{galley number}` for an article
URL Path, `…/view/{number}/version/{id}/{galley}` on an older version's
page. On a new journal and server Settings › Workflow › Submission ›
"Components" ("Article Components", "Preprint Components") showed the
supplementary box ticked for the nine components listed, and "These are
dependent files…" ticked for "Multimedia", "Image" and "HTML
Stylesheet"; the galley upload offered none of the three. The window's
"Close" after a change asked "The data on this form has changed. Do you
wish to continue without saving?"; "Save" closed it with no notice.

<a id="fn-q7"></a>
**q7** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 10, 22; A4), OJS and OPS: an
article with "PDF" of "Article Text" ("Preprint Text"), "Data" of "Data
Set", "Notes" of "Other", a French "HTML", a remote galley, and "Draft"
added on the "Galleys" page with its upload closed before a file was
chosen (its row read "Draft English"); an "Image" galley could not be
made (above). Signed out and as the Reader, the page listed "PDF",
"HTML (French (Canada))" and "Remote", then "Data" and "Notes", in the
"Galleys" page's order; "Draft" nowhere; screen-reader headings
"Downloads" and "Additional Files" ("Téléchargements", "Fichiers
supplémentaires"). With "Data Set" no longer supplementary, "Data" moved
to the main list; made dependent, it left the page. Listings: on the
journal the issue's table of contents, the home page's "Current Issue"
and, beside it, "Latest Publications" showed the main galleys only; with
"Include the current issue's table of contents" unticked, "Latest
Publications" showed "PDF", "Data", "Remote" and "Draft", and "Draft"
answered "404 Not Found"; ticked again, the main galleys only. The
server's "Latest preprints" and "Archives" showed every galley, "Draft"
included, answering "404 Not Found".

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — Addresses: `ArticleHandler::initialize()`: a digit-only path is
looked up by number, anything else by `Repo::submission()->getByUrlPath()`;
when `getBestId()` differs from the requested path it redirects to
`[$currentUrlPath, ...$args]`; a `version` sub-path picks the publication
by its id, and an unknown id leaves the typed `Publication $publication`
property unassigned, which fails (the versions spec's OJS3); the galley
is matched by `getBestGalleyId()`, a digit-only galley path matching a
galley's number redirects to its best id, a galley found only in another
published publication redirects to the article's view, and anything else
is `NotFoundHttpException`. OPS `PreprintHandler::initialize()`: the
redirect builds `$newArgs = $args; $newArgs[0] = $currentUrlPath;` after
the path was shifted off `$args` (OPS2); no digit-only galley redirect
(OPS3); `$publication` is untyped, so an unknown version is a plain
`NotFoundHttpException`. Notices: `submission.viewingPreview` "This is a
preview and has not been published. <a href="{$url}">View
submission</a>" with `url` → `dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}`
(A5); `submission.outdatedVersion` "This is an outdated version
published on {$datePublished}. Read the <a
href="{$urlRecentVersion}">most recent version</a>." OJS chains the two
with `{elseif}`; OPS tests them separately (OPS1). An older
publication's page also gets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
and a canonical link to the current version. Live-probed 2026-09-25
(Rules 1–5, 13): notes q2, q3, q4 and q10 record what the addresses
opened.

<a id="fn-q2"></a>
**q2** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 1, 2; OPS2), OJS and OPS: an
article with an older published version, "URL Path" typed "probe-path"
on the new version's "Publication Settings" ("Preprint entry") page and
saved, then published. Signed out: the number address forwarded to
`…/view/probe-path`; the number followed by a galley's number opened
`…/view/probe-path/{galley}`'s PDF reader on the journal and the
preprint's page on the server; followed by `/version/{older id}` it
opened `…/view/probe-path/version/{id}` with the outdated notice on the
journal, and "404 Not Found" at `…/view/probe-path/{id}` on the server.
The versions' own addresses carried the ids of the "Versions" links
(`…/article/view/60/version/68` for "Version of Record 1.0", `…/preprint/view/43/version/45`
for "Author Original 1.0"); the current version's own such address
opened the plain page with no notice. `/version/999999`, and another
article's version id, answered a blank server error page on the journal
and "404 Not Found" on the server. The field reads "URL Path" on both,
its help "Set a custom URL for this publication, or leave blank to use
the default." (OJS) and "An optional path to use in the URL instead of
the ID." (OPS).

<a id="fn-q3"></a>
**q3** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 3, 4; A5; OPS1), OJS and OPS:
signed out, as the Reader and as a Reviewer (OJS), an unpublished
article's address, a scheduled one's (OJS), a draft third version's own
address, an unknown number, an unknown URL Path and another journal's
article number each answered "404 Not Found" (OMP control: an
unpublished book's address alike). The Journal Manager's "Preview"
opened the page under "This is a preview and has not been published.
View submission", with no "Published" line and no "Versions" list;
"View submission" opened the submission's workflow on its current
stage. The Author, typing the address, got the same preview; the
Author's "View submission" landed on "The current role does not have
access to this operation.". On the server, a new version previewed after
"Create New Version" on a posted preprint showed that notice and under it
"This is an outdated version published on 2026-09-25. Read the most
recent version.", the day of the preview, and the label line "Preprint /
2026-09-25 (Author Original 1.2)"; the journal showed the preview notice
alone. A scheduled article seeded as published sits at the Submission
stage, whose workflow offers no "Preview"; the manager still opened its
preview by the address.

<a id="fn-q4"></a>
**q4** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 5; A6), OJS and OPS: an article
with a first version backdated to 2026-09-01 and a second one published.
Signed out, the older version's page (from "Versions") read "This is an
outdated version published on 2026-09-01. Read the most recent
version.", and "most recent version" opened the article's address. The
older page was headed with its own title while the browser tab read the
current version's title and the journal's name (two runs on the
journal).

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — Dates and versions: `firstPublication` is the publication with the
earliest `datePublished` among all of the submission's publications
(`ArticleHandler::view()`, `PreprintHandler::view()`); `submissions.published`
"Published" (OJS app) / "Posted" (OPS app); `submission.updatedOn`
"{$datePublished} — Updated on {$dateUpdated}"; `submission.versions`
"Versions"; entries `submission.versionIdentity` "{$datePublished}
({$version})" over `array_reverse(getPublishedPublications())`, the shown
one unlinked, the current one to the plain address, others to
`version/{id}`. The version name is `Repo::publication()->getVersionString()`
→ `PublicationVersionInfo::__toString()` → `publication.versionStage.display`
"{$stage} {$majorNumbering}.{$minorNumbering}", which `lib/pkp/locale/fr_CA`
lacks (A1). OPS label line: `common.publication` "Preprint",
`navigation.breadcrumbSeparator`, the same `submission.versionIdentity`.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 7–9), OJS and OPS: one version read
"Published 2026-09-01"; two read "Published 2026-09-01 — Updated on
2026-09-24" ("Posted 2026-09-01 — Updated on 2026-09-25" on the server).
"Versions" listed "2026-09-24 (Version of Record 1.1)" then "2026-09-01
(Version of Record 1.0)" ("Author Original …" on the server), the shown
one plain, the current one linked to the plain address and the older to
its own; a draft third version was not listed, but its creation changed
both pages' date lines (the versions spec's A6). The label line read
"Preprint / 2026-09-25 (Author Original 1.1)" on the current page and
"Preprint / 2026-09-01 (Author Original 1.0)" on the older one.

<a id="fn-q5"></a>
**q5** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 8, 9, 21; A1; OPS7), OJS and OPS,
French opened through the language's own address: the "Versions" list
read "2026-09-24 (##publication.versionStage.display##)", the label line
"Prépublication / 2026-09-25 (##publication.versionStage.display##)"
(a press's book page the same key, the control). The labels turned
French on the journal and the article's French title, abstract and
keyword showed where the version had them; the preprint's keywords
label read "##preprint.subject## : francais". The role under each
contributor's name read "Author" on both apps' French pages; the role's
French name on the scratch journals was not checked, and the list is
*Contributors & affiliations*'.

<a id="fn-q8"></a>
**q8** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 11; Settings bullets 1–3; OPS4;
OJS9), OJS and OPS, signed out: "PDF" opened the PDF reader; "HTML"
opened the HTML reader on the journal and downloaded `preprint.html` on
the server, the browser staying on the preprint's page (also for the
French "/html-fr" galley pressed from the French page); an XML galley
opened the journal's page laid out by Lens ("Abstract", "Main Text",
"Introduction", "Contents", "Info"), its script failing as it loaded
("Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Queue')"), and
downloaded `article.xml` on the server; `notes.md` / `not-an-image.txt`
downloaded with the browser on the article's page; the remote galley
landed on its remote address. With "PDF.JS PDF Viewer", "HTML Article
Galley" or "eLife Lens Article Viewer" unticked, its galley downloaded.

<a id="fn-q9"></a>
**q9** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 12; A2), OJS and OPS, an article
with a PDF and (journal) an HTML galley in both versions, the second
version's title ending " second": the older version's readers showed
"This is an outdated version published on 2026-09-25. Read the most
recent version." ("September 25, 2026" in the HTML reader); the arrow
and the title opened the article's unversioned page; the PDF reader's
title was the older version's, the HTML reader's the current one's with
the older version's file in its frame. The older PDF reader showed "0 of
0" in an empty viewer with no message (the viewer's file request
answered "not found", twice per visit) and its "Download" got no file.
With the galley's URL Path "pdf" kept into the new version, the older
reader showed the document; after "Change File" on the new version's
galley it showed the replacement file; with the copy's URL Path changed
and a new galley "New" given "pdf" and a file of its own, it showed
nothing again (two runs per app).

<a id="fn-q10"></a>
**q10** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 13; OPS3), OJS and OPS, signed
out: a PDF galley with URL Path "pdf" typed at its number address
forwarded to `…/pdf` on the journal and answered "404 Not Found" on the
server; "/nosuchgalley" answered "404 Not Found" on both; after "pdf"
was changed to "pdfnew" on a new version, `…/pdf` opened the article's
page on both, and so did an older galley's number without a version
part.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — "How to Cite": `plugins/generic/citationStyleLanguage/CitationStyleLanguagePlugin.php`
(OJS and OPS copies identical outside the vendored CSL data): `register()`
hooks `ArticleHandler::view` and `PreprintHandler::view` to
`getTemplateData()`, and `Templates::Article::Details` to
`addCitationMarkup()`, which appends `templates/citation-block.blade` at
the end of the OJS side column; OPS prints its own copy inline in
`preprint_details.tpl` (`{if $citation}`). Styles: `getCitationStyles()`
defaults with APA `isPrimary`, titles `plugins.generic.citationStyleLanguage.style.*`
("ABNT", "ACM", "ACS", "AMA", "APA", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "MLA",
"Turabian", "Vancouver"); downloads `getCitationDownloads()` ("Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley
(RIS)", "BibTeX"). Headings `submission.howToCite` "How to Cite",
`submission.howToCite.citationFormats` "More Citation Formats",
`submission.howToCite.downloadCitation` "Download Citation". The format
links carry `data-json-href`; `js/articleCitation.js` fetches it and
replaces `#citationOutput`, restoring the old citation silently when the
fetch fails. `getCitation()` builds title, `container-title` (journal
name), `container-title-short` (abbreviation, else acronym), volume and
issue, section, pages, article number, authors, URL, DOI, `issued` (the
shown version's date) and `original-date` (the first version's, set only
when its `datePublished` differs from the shown version's, so two
versions of one day never print it). On a preprint server
`getTemplateData()` reads `$issue` and `$chapter`, which only the journal
and press branches set, and the compiled citation template reads
`container-title-short`, which a preprint's citation data lacks: each
rendering logs PHP warnings ("Undefined variable $issue", "Undefined
variable $chapter", "Undefined property: stdClass::$container-title-short"),
with no effect on the page (test run 2026-09-25, the OPS server log).
`downloadCitation()` names the file `urlencode(substr(title, 0, 60))` plus
the format's extension; `templates/citation-styles/ris.blade` formats
its dates with strftime patterns (`'%Y/%m/%d'`) through
`Carbon::format()`, which prints the "%" (A8). The "Citation Style
Language" plugin is off on a new context (seed facts, all three apps,
2026-09-23).
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, "How to Cite"; Rules 15, 15a, 15b), OJS
and OPS: off on a new context there was no block; on, the APA citation
of the shown version under "How to Cite". "More Citation Formats"
toggled a list of the eleven formats, with "Download Citation",
"Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" and "BibTeX" under them; each format
replaced the citation in place with one request, the address unchanged
and the list closing; a reload showed APA again. The citations carried
the title, the contributors, the name, the issue "1(1)" and pages
"12-34" (journal), the date and the address as Rule 15 says; the
downloads came as files named after the first 60 characters of the title
with "+" for spaces, starting "TY  - JOUR" and "@article{…". An older
version's citation named its own title and "September 1, 2026" where
the current one's read "September 25, 2026". OMP control: the same list
on a book page. Test run 2026-09-25 (Rule 15), OJS and OPS: with both
versions published the same day, the current version's "APA" citation
read "Author, A. (2026). Tidal Patterns Revised. {journal}, 1(1).
{address}" ("… In {server name}. {address}" on the server), with no
"(Original work published …)".

<a id="fn-q11"></a>
**q11** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 15, 15c; A7; A8; OJS1), OJS and
OPS, with the plugin on: on an article in a published issue and a posted
preprint, "MLA" replaced the citation and a reload restored APA;
"BibTeX" downloaded a ".bib" named after the title. "ABNT" printed a
preprint's title and the server's name back to back and the date "24
Sept.2026" on both apps; the RIS file's "PY" and "Y2" lines read
"%2026/%09/%01" and "%2026/%09/%25". On a journal article published with
no issue, and on one published with "Assign To Future Issue and Publish
Immediately": signed out, a format left the citation unchanged and a
download opened a blank page; as the Reader, the Author and an
unassigned Section Editor, the citation stayed and the downloads showed
"404 Not Found"; as the Journal Manager, an assigned Section Editor and
an assigned Copyeditor, both worked. On the preprint server every role
got every format and download (OMP control: a published book's "MLA"
and "BibTeX" worked signed out).

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — Settings window: `CitationStyleLanguageSettingsForm.php` with
`templates/settings.tpl`; labels `plugins.generic.citationStyleLanguage.settings.citationFormatsPrimary`
"Primary Citation Format" and its description, `…citationFormats`
"Additional Citation Formats", `…citationDownloads` "Downloadable
Formats", `…publisherLocation` "Publisher Location"; `execute()` stores
the four settings and posts `common.changesSaved` "Your changes have been
saved."; the row's "Settings" (`manager.plugins.settings`) comes from
`getActions()` only while the plugin is enabled. With no
`primaryCitationStyle` stored the form checks no radio and
`getPrimaryStyleName()` falls back to APA. Who reaches Settings › Website:
[→ settings access](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md#settings-access).
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the settings window; Rule 16; Side
effects; Settings bullets 4, 5), OJS and OPS, with a press as the
control: the row's arrow and "Settings" showed only while the plugin was
ticked; the window, titled "Citation Style Language", opened with no
primary format chosen, all eleven additional formats and both download
formats ticked and "Publisher Location" empty, its buttons "Cancel" and
"OK". "OK" closed it with "Your changes have been saved."; "Cancel"
after changes to all four fields stored nothing and asked nothing; the
window's "Close" after a change asked "The data on this form has
changed. Do you wish to continue without saving?", leaving the page
asked "Leave site?", and the window reopened unchanged. Ticking the
plugin showed "The plugin "Citation Style Language" has been enabled."
(also on the press); unticking asked "Are you sure you want to disable
this plugin?" and then showed "…has been disabled."; ticked again, the
window and the block came back with IEEE, one format and "London, U.K."
as left. The press's window reads "…on your book landing page.".

<a id="fn-q12"></a>
**q12** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 16; A9), OJS and OPS: "IEEE"
chosen, every additional format but "MLA" and the "BibTeX" box unticked,
"London, U.K." typed, "OK": every published article showed IEEE first at
once, the list offered "MLA" alone and "Download Citation" "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley
(RIS)" alone. "London, U.K." appeared in no on-screen format of a journal
article, and in "ABNT", "ACS", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "Turabian"
and "Vancouver" for a preprint ("… London, U.K., Sept. 24 …" in IEEE);
the "BibTeX" file carried `place={London, U.K.}` on both, the RIS file
nothing. Both download formats unticked: "Download Citation" left with
its label. Every additional format unticked: "More Citation Formats"
still showed, both downloads were in the page, and pressing it twice
left the list closed.

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — Chart: `article_details.tpl` / `preprint_details.tpl` print the
section when `$activeTheme->getOption('displayStats') != 'none'`,
calling `ThemePlugin::displayUsageStatsGraph()`; heading
`plugins.themes.default.displayStats.downloads` "Downloads", hidden text
`…displayStats.noStats` "Download data is not yet available.", removed by
`lib/pkp/js/usage-stats-chart.js` on `usageStatsChartLoaded.pkp` whatever
the data. `UsageEvent` fires in `view()` for the page and in
`download()` for a galley's own file.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 17; Side effects; Settings bullet 6; A3),
all three apps: "Usage statistics display options" offered the three
choices, "Do not display…" ticked on a new context; bar and line each
added a section headed "Downloads" after the abstract with that chart,
nothing plotted over the current year's months, and the sentence was
gone once the chart drew; "Do not display…" again removed the section.
Each page opening wrote one usage event and each PDF reader opening and
"Download" one file event to the install's usage log; nothing processed
them, the chart stayed empty and the server's home read "Downloads: 0".

<a id="fn-m"></a>
**m** — References: OJS `{if count($parsedCitations) || (string)
$publication->getData('citationsRaw')}`; OPS drops the `(string)` cast and
tests the value `PublicationDAO::fromRow()` sets, an object that is always
true, hence the empty heading ([Citations & references](U42-citations-and-references.md),
its A20). Each citation prints `Citation::getRawCitationWithLinks()`,
whose pattern links an address up to the next space or bracket and trims
only a trailing "." or "," (A10), and calls
`Templates::Article::Details::Reference`
(`Templates::Preprint::Details::Reference`), where the Crossref plugin adds
reference DOIs (*DOIs*). The citations spec's Rule 27 describes the same
block with its own probes; the block's rules live here from this spec on.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 18; A10), OJS and OPS: five references
showed under "References" in the main column, one paragraph each, in
list order, as typed ("Smith & Jones (2020). Values < 5 and > 3
matter."); each https or ftp address was a link opening a new tab, a
trailing "." or "," outside it, and "(ftp://files.example.org/ridge/data.csv)"
linked with its ")". A context with the References box unticked on its
Metadata settings still showed an article's references. An article with
none showed no heading on the journal and an empty "References" heading
on the server.

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — Publication Facts Label: `plugins/generic/pflPlugin/PflPlugin.php`
(OJS only), `displayArticlePfl()` on `Templates::Article::Details`, left
out when `$section->getMetaReviewed()` is false (the section form's
`manager.sections.submissionReview` "Will not be peer-reviewed", stored
inverted; the seed sets `metaReviewed` true) or when the setting
`dateStart` is after the article's `dateSubmitted`; `templates/pfl.tpl`
mounts `<publication-facts-label>` and fetches labels from
`pfl/locale/{locale}.json` (`en.json`: "Publication Facts", "Peer
reviewers", "Data availability", "External funding", "Competing
interests", "Articles accepted", "Days to publication", "Indexed in",
"Editorial team list", "Society", "Publisher"). On this build the
plugin's hooks use two constants it does not import (`STATUS_PUBLISHED`,
`STYLE_SEQUENCE_LAST`), so both fail on every article page (OJS5).
Settings: `PflSettingsForm.php` with `templates/settings.tpl`; DOAJ,
Latindex and MEDLINE are checked by outbound requests on the online
ISSN, `academicSocietyUrl` by `FormValidatorUrl`, `scopusUrl` against
`^https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/[0-9]+$`, `wosUrl` against
`^https://mjl.clarivate.com`, `dateStart` by `strtotime()`; the warning
block shows when `PluginRegistry::getPlugin('generic', 'FundingPlugin')`
is absent or disabled.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the settings window; Settings bullet 7;
OJS2), OJS: the plugin row showed "Settings" only while ticked; the
window, titled "Publication Facts Label plugin", opened every time with
"Funding Plugin Not Present" and "The Funding plugin is not present and
enabled. In order for funding data to be presented by the Publication
Facts Label, this plugin will need to be installed and enabled, and
provided with the relevant data for each submission. Check the Plugin
Gallery for this plugin.", then "Journal Information", "Exclude by
Date", "Journal's Index Listings", "Automated Listing of Indexes in the
PFL" and "Manual Listing of Indexes in the PFL"; its buttons "Cancel"
and "OK", its "Close" after a change asking the same question as the
citation window. "Will not be peer-reviewed" was unticked on a new
journal's "Articles". The Plugin Gallery could not be searched: its list
answers a server error on the test installs.

<a id="fn-q13"></a>
**q13** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 19; OJS3; OJS5), OJS: with the
plugin on, no article page showed the panel, signed out or as the
Reader, after a full valid save, with "Start Date" 2099-01-01 or
2020-01-01, with "Will not be peer-reviewed" ticked or unticked, and on
the French page, which fetched no label file either. Each page answered
normally; the server log recorded the plugin failing in both its hooks.

<a id="fn-q15"></a>
**q15** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the settings window; OJS7;
OJS8), OJS: "not a url" and "http://nodot" in the society "URL" were
refused in the window with "Please enter a valid URL." and no save was
sent; a valid name and address saved and came back. "Start Date" took
"2099-01-01" and "2020-01-01" typed key by key; "notadate" left the box
empty; "2026-99-99" stayed in the box, "OK" showed "Your changes have
been saved." and the box was empty on reopening. Ticking "Directory of
Open Access Journals", "Latindex" or "MEDLINE" was refused with the
"could not be verified" notice, with and without an online ISSN
("0378-5955", saved on Settings › Journal › "Masthead", which refuses
"Save" until "Country" is chosen), the three together in one notice;
"Google Scholar" alone saved. "https://example.org/x" in the Scopus
"URL" and "https://example.org/y" in the Web of Science one were refused
with their messages, in a notice and in the window;
"https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/12345" and
"https://mjl.clarivate.com/search-results?issn=0378-5955" saved. After
each refusal the window showed the saved values: the stored Scopus
address in place of the typed one, "Directory of Open Access Journals"
unticked again. "Cancel" after a change stored nothing.

<a id="fn-n"></a>
**n** — Recommendations: `plugins/generic/recommendByAuthor/RecommendByAuthorPlugin.php::callbackTemplateArticlePageFooter()`
on `Templates::Article::Footer::PageFooter` builds a paginator over
`APP\search\SubmissionSearchResult::newCollection()`, whose items carry
`submission`, `currentPublication`, `context`, `section`, `issue`;
`templates/articleFooter.tpl` reads `publishedSubmission` and `journal`,
keys the collection has not carried since the search rebuild (OJS4). Ten a

`plugins.generic.recommendByAuthor.heading` "Most read articles by the

searches the article's keywords (`Repo::controlledVocab()->getBySymbolic()`)
through the submission collector's `searchPhrase()`, ten a page, heading
"Similar Articles", `…advancedSearchIntro` "You may also

outside a published issue, so an article in a published issue is never a
candidate (OJS10). The search index is filled by queued jobs, which the
test installs run only on demand (seed facts; [Search](U15-search.md)).
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 20; Fields, "Recommendations"): neither
list appeared on any page, so where the lists sit under the article
rests on the hook's name; note q14.

**q14** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 20; Settings bullets 8, 9; OJS4;
OJS10), OJS: with "Recommend Articles by Author" on, the pages of two
articles by the same contributor, of an article whose contributor has
ten others and of an article whose contributor has none all opened
normally, signed out, as the Reader and as the Journal Manager, with no
"Most read articles by the same author(s)"; the server log recorded
"Call to a member function getCurrentPublication() on null" for each
page whose contributor has another article, nothing for the other; with
the plugin off the page opened the same. With "Recommend Similar
Articles" on, an article whose two keywords twelve other published
articles share showed no "Similar Articles", before and after the queued
jobs ran, signed out and as the Reader; nothing was logged. On a new
journal both plugins were listed unticked; ticking each showed "The
plugin "…" has been enabled.", with no "Settings" on their rows.

**j** — Summary: OJS `templates/frontend/objects/article_summary.tpl`,
included by `issue_toc.tpl`, `latest_article.tpl` (the home page,
`indexJournal.tpl`), `catalogCategory.tpl` (`hideGalleys=true`) and
`search.tpl` (`showDatePublished=true hideGalleys=true`); OPS
`templates/frontend/objects/preprint_summary.tpl`, included by
`indexServer.tpl`, `preprints.tpl`, `sections.tpl`, `catalogCategory.tpl`
and `search.tpl` (the last two `hideGalleys=true`). Author line: shown
when the section's `hideAuthor` is off and the publication's
`hideAuthor` is the default, or the publication forces it; the
per-publication switch has no control on any form. The section's box
is read by the issue's table of contents only. The main-galley filter
runs only where `primaryGenreIds` is assigned, which
`IssueHandler::setupIssueTemplate()` does, for the issue's page and for
the home page, `IndexHandler` calling it while the home page shows the
current issue; "Latest Publications" on the same page inherits it (A4).
"Latest Publications" reads `Submission\Collector::filterByLatestPublished()`
(OJS `classes/submission/Collector.php`), which keeps only current
publications whose `issue_id` is null or whose issue is unpublished
(the appearance spec's Rule 13 and OJS3). OPS DOI line: a
loop over `$pubIdPlugins` for type `doi`; DOIs are no `pubIds` plugin,
and OPS ships no `plugins/pubIds` at all (OPS6). OPS details:
`publication.galley.downloads` "Downloads: {$downloads}",
`submission.dates` "Submitted {$submitted} - Posted {$published}",
`submission.numberOfVersions` "Versions: {$numberOfVersions}". Section
option `manager.sections.hideTocAuthor` "Omit author names for section
items from issues' table of contents.".
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the article summary; Rule 22; Settings
bullet 10; OPS6; OPS9), OJS and OPS, signed out, as the Reader and as
the Journal Manager: summaries on the journal's issue table of contents,
"Current Issue", "Latest Publications", category page and search
results, and on the server's "Latest preprints", "Archives" (the main
menu's "Archives", headed "Archives"), section and category pages and
search results. The cover and the title (with "Alpha subtitle") linked
to the article's address and opened it when pressed; the author line
read "Ann Author (Author)"; "12-34" under an article with pages (OJS);
the preprint's keywords "kfive", "alpha", only the current version's;
"Downloads: 0 - Submitted 2026-09-25 - Posted 2026-09-25", then " -
Versions: 2" for a preprint with two versions; the date "2026-09-25" on
the journal's search results only; no galleys on search and category
pages; no DOI line on any preprint summary although the preprint's page
showed "DOI:". On the server's home and "Archives" lists the keyword row
lay across the middle of the cover, where a press opened nothing, while
the top and the bottom opened the preprint (two runs). "Omit author
names…" was unticked on the seeded "Articles" and "Reviews" and on a new
section; ticked and saved, it removed the author line from the issue's
table of contents and "Current Issue" only. A preprint server's section
form has no such box. Test run 2026-09-25 (Rule 22), OJS: with both of a
journal's articles published in its current, published issue and
"Latest Publications" chosen in the theme, the home page showed the
categories and "Current Issue", listing both articles, and no "Latest
Publications" section.

**q16** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Settings bullets 1–4, 7–9; OPS4), OJS
and OPS, a new scratch journal and server, Settings › Website ›
"Plugins" › "Installed Plugins", "Generic Plugins": the journal listed
"PDF.JS PDF Viewer", "HTML Article Galley" and "eLife Lens Article
Viewer" ticked, "Citation Style Language", "Publication Facts Label
plugin", "Recommend Articles by Author" and "Recommend Similar Articles"
unticked; the server "PDF.JS PDF Viewer" ticked, "Citation Style
Language" unticked and none of the other five. Unticking asked "Are you
sure you want to disable this plugin?" and showed "The plugin "…" has
been disabled."; a PDF galley then downloaded. A press (the control)
lists "PDF.js PDF Viewer" and "HTML Monograph File" and none of the
three journal-only rows.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Scenario seeding. The seeded journal and server
(`publicknowledge`) carry no published item (seed facts), so every
scenario publishes its own articles through `POST scenarios/submission`
(`published: true`, submitter the context's author); galleys come from
`galleys[]` (`{label, file}`, `{label, urlRemote}`, with `locale`,
`urlPath` and `genre` where a scenario names them), the display values
from the version keys (`subtitle`, `plainLanguageSummary`, `keywords`,
`categories`, `coverImage` with the fixture `profile-image-400.png`,
OJS `articleNumber`, `urlPath`) and the references from `citationsRaw`.
Fixtures: `article.pdf`, `article.html`, `article.xml`, `notes.md` on
OJS; `preprint.pdf`, `preprint.html`, `not-an-image.txt` on OPS. In the
scenarios {journal address} is the context's address, {number} the
submission's id and {today} the day of the run, written as the pages
write it. Scenarios 1 and 4 run on `publicknowledge`: scenario 1 signed
out, submitter `author.alex`, its first article with OJS `section:
'ART'`, `issue: {volume: 1, number: 2, year: 2014}` and `categories: ['eng']`
(the leaf path; the seed refuses the full path), its second with no `issue` (an article in no
issue); scenario 4 with the ready accounts `manager.maya`, `author.alex`
(the submitter) and `reader.rosa`, passwords as users.md gives them, the
unpublished article carried to Production by OJS `decisions:
['sendExternalReview', 'accept', 'sendToProduction']` (a submitted
preprint already sits there) and the scheduled one by `published: true`
with `issue: {volume: 2, number: 1, year: 2015}` (seed facts). The
others run on their own scratch context from `POST scenarios/context`,
with throwaway `users[]` (password: the username twice): `manager` and
`author` everywhere, `reader` in scenario 5; OJS contexts that need a
published issue seed `issues: [{volume: 1, number: 1, year: 2026,
published: true}]` and publish into it with `issue`. Per scenario:
scenario 2 at the context's defaults; scenario 3 with `plugins:
{citationstylelanguageplugin: {enabled: true}}`, its second version
made on screen as `manager`, since no key makes one ("Create New
Version", the title changed on "Title & Abstract", then "Publish":
[Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md),
scenarios 4 and 5); scenario 5 with `context.enabled: false` for the
first context and `restrictSiteAccess: true` ("Users must be
registered…") for the second; scenario 6 with `context.name` "Coastal
Review" ("Coastal Preprints") and the same `plugins` entry, the
visitor's steps read against the mail catcher (Mailpit,
`http://127.0.0.1:8025`) scoped by the context's addresses; scenario 7
with `plugins: {pdfjsviewerplugin: {enabled: false}}` and `themeOptions:
{displayStats: 'bar'}`; scenario 8 with `context.supportedLocales` and
`supportedSubmissionLocales` `['en', 'fr_CA']`, the title, abstract and
`keywords` as locale maps and the "HTML" galley at `locale: 'fr_CA'`
(a `/fr_CA/` address switches the session to French, seed facts, so the
English page is read first and the control opens `/en/` again);
scenario 9 (OJS) with `categories: [{path: 'oceans', title: 'Oceans'}]`,
the issue's `coverImage`, and `themeOptions: {journalContentOrganization:
[1, 2, 3]}` (the categories, "Latest Publications" and "Current
Issue"); scenario 10 (OPS) with the same `categories`. Scenarios 9
(OJS) and 10 (OPS) run in each app's serial project: a category page
lists what the search index holds, which only the queued jobs the test
runs fill. "Omit author
names…", a contributor's Bio Statement (after "Country" is picked), the
URN "Assign", the public JATS XML and the Crossmark box are set on
screen; the upload and the seed refuse "Image" and "HTML Stylesheet"
galleys, and no key sets a version's DOI. Live-probed 2026-09-25: the
seeded journal's home page showed "Current Issue" and no "Latest
Publications"; a scratch journal seeded with the option showed the
categories, "Latest Publications" and "Current Issue". "Latest
Publications" is absent while no article sits outside a published issue,
so scenario 9's home page, whose two articles are in the issue, has
none (note j).

<a id="fn-f-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — Note g: `publication.versionStage.display` and the version
stage keys are missing from `lib/pkp/locale/fr_CA`. First seen 2026-09-24
in passing during the appearance spec's claim check (a press's book page
also labels its date "##catalog.published##", the monograph page's
business); live-probed 2026-09-25 on both apps and the press (note q5),
the date printed "2026-09-24" in French as in English.

<a id="fn-f-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — `PdfJsViewerPlugin::submissionCallback()` builds `pdfUrl` from
`[$submission->getBestId(), $galley->getBestGalleyId(), $galley->getFile()->getId()]`
with no `version` part; `ArticleHandler::initialize()` (and OPS's) then
looks the galley up in the current publication, finds it in an older
published one only, and redirects to the unversioned `download` op with
no galley, which answers `NotFoundHttpException`; pdf.js then logs
"MissingPDFException" in the page. The reader's "Download" link carries
the same address with a `download` attribute, so the browser saves
nothing and stays. A copied galley with the same URL Path resolves in
the current publication instead, and serves the file the copy shares
with the published galley ([Galleys](U46-galleys.md), its A4: "Change
File" on the new version's galley changes the published version's
file). The HTML and Lens readers build versioned addresses. Live-probed
2026-09-25, note q9 (two runs on the journal, one on the server).

<a id="fn-f-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — Note l: `usage-stats-chart.js` removes the sentence as soon
as a chart is drawn, data or none. Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note l),
all three apps, as first seen 2026-09-24 during the appearance spec's
claim check: an empty chart and no sentence.

<a id="fn-f-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — Note j: the summaries skip non-main galleys only when
`primaryGenreIds` is set (the issue's table of contents, and a journal's
home page while it shows the current issue); elsewhere every galley of
the current publication is linked, one with no file too, whose
`download` finds no `submissionFileId` and answers
`NotFoundHttpException`. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q7.

<a id="fn-f-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — Note f: the notice's link is always
`dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}`, which the Author's role
may not open; the Author landed on
`user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.roleBasedAccessDenied`.
Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q3, both apps.

<a id="fn-f-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — `article.tpl` / `preprint.tpl` pass
`getCurrentPublication()->getLocalizedFullTitle()` to the header as the
page title, whichever publication the page shows. Live-probed
2026-09-25, note q4, both apps.

<a id="fn-f-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — The "ABNT" answer for a preprint reads
`<b>{title}</b><b>{server name}</b>, 24 Sept.2026`; the journal's ABNT
citation has the same "Sept.2026". Both come from the vendored CSL style
and its locale. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q11.

<a id="fn-f-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — Note h: `ris.blade`'s `PY` and `Y2` lines (the version's
date and the day of access) pass strftime patterns to
`Carbon::format()`. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q11, both apps.

<a id="fn-f-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — With no format ticked, the list holds only the downloads and
the button's toggle does not open it (`aria-expanded` stays "false").
Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q12, both apps.

<a id="fn-f-a10"></a>
**f-a10** — Note m: the link pattern stops at spaces and square or
angle brackets, not at a parenthesis. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note m,
both apps.

<a id="fn-f-a11"></a>
**f-a11** — Note c: `PKP\publication\DAO::fromRow()` reads the keyword
entries (with the subjects, disciplines and supporting agencies) with
no `orderBy`; the `seq` that `controlledVocab\Repository::insertBySymbolic()`
writes 1, 2, … is never read. The order returned follows the query plan
(a hash on the entries gives the reverse of the rows' order on disk, a
hash on the vocabularies the disk order) and the rows' place on disk.
Every publication save (`DAO::update()` → `saveControlledVocab()`),
publishing and scheduling included, deletes the entries and writes them
again in the order just read. Seen on OPS test runs 2026-09-25 (twice)
and 2026-09-26 (scenarios 1 and 10): keywords seeded "tide", "current"
read "Keywords: current, tide"; in the OJS test database on 2026-09-26
the same seed's keywords were stored "current" first after the seed's
publish on four runs, in the typed order on later ones. Probed
2026-09-26, OJS and OPS: moving one keyword's row on disk turned
scenario 1's line to "current, tide" on four runs of four; four plain
"Save"s on Publication › Metadata kept "alpha, beta, gamma".

<a id="fn-f-ojs1"></a>
**f-ojs1** — `CitationStyleLanguagePlugin::getTemplateData()` passes
`issueId` only when `ArticleHandler` has an issue;
`pages/CitationStyleLanguageHandler::isUnpublished()` counts an OJS
article as unpublished when no issue is passed or the issue is not
published, and `canUserAccess()` then admits managers, site
administrators and assigned sub-editors or assistants only. A signed-in
reader's `get` and `download` requests answer `NotFoundHttpException`;
a signed-out visitor's fail with a server error, the log reading
`TypeError` `CitationStyleLanguageHandler::canUserAccess(): Argument #2
($userRoles) must be of type array, null given`. `articleCitation.js`
swallows the failed fetch. On OPS a posted preprint's formats and
downloads work for every role. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q11.

<a id="fn-f-ojs2"></a>
**f-ojs2** — `PflSettingsForm::fetch()` assigns `fundingPluginPresent`
from `PluginRegistry::getPlugin('generic', 'FundingPlugin')`; no such
plugin ships (funders are core metadata, [Funding](U43-funding.md)), so
`templates/settings.tpl` always prints
`plugins.generic.pflPlugin.fundingPluginMissing` and its description,
while `displayArticlePfl()` reads the context's `funders` setting.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note k): the warning on every opening; the
Plugin Gallery could not be searched on the test installs.

<a id="fn-f-ojs3"></a>
**f-ojs3** — `templates/pfl.tpl` fetches `pfl/locale/` + `Locale::getLocale()`
+ `.json`; the folder holds `fr.json` and no `fr_CA.json`, and the fetch's
failure only logs "PFL: failed to load translations" to the console.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note q13): the French page showed no panel and
fetched no label file, the same as the English page, so the entry rests
on the code until the panel shows.

<a id="fn-f-ojs4"></a>
**f-ojs4** — Note n. The search results' shape changed with pkp-lib's
Laravel Scout rebuild (pkp/pkp-lib#8920, merged 2025-08-01), which
removed the `publishedSubmission` / `journal` keys the plugin's template
still reads; `$submission->getCurrentPublication()` on a null fails in
`articleFooter.tpl`. The app catches the error inside the hook, logs
"Plugin …RecommendByAuthorPlugin failed to handle the hook
Templates::Article::Footer::PageFooter" and serves the page without the
list. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q14.

<a id="fn-f-ojs5"></a>
**f-ojs5** — Note k: `Undefined constant
"APP\plugins\generic\pflPlugin\STATUS_PUBLISHED"` (`PflPlugin.php`, in
the side-column hook `Templates::Article::Details`) and `Undefined
constant "…\STYLE_SEQUENCE_LAST"` (in the `TemplateManager::display`
hook), each caught and logged as "Plugin …PflPlugin failed to handle the
hook …" on every article page, which still answers normally.
Live-probed 2026-09-25, notes q6 and q13.

<a id="fn-f-ojs6"></a>
**f-ojs6** — Note d: `display.tpl` picks `issue.return` whenever the page
has an issue, though its link is the article's `parentUrl`. Live-probed
2026-09-25 (note d), two runs.

<a id="fn-f-ojs7"></a>
**f-ojs7** — Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q15: after a refused "OK" the
window reloaded its fields from the saved settings.

<a id="fn-f-ojs8"></a>
**f-ojs8** — The date picker writes a hidden field that the form
stores, filled only as keys are typed; with "2026-99-99" the save
stored an empty start date and no refusal from the `strtotime()` check
(note k) appeared. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q15.

<a id="fn-f-ojs9"></a>
**f-ojs9** — Note e: `lensGalley`'s `display.tpl` loads MathJax 3.2.2,
while `lib/lens/lens.js` calls the MathJax 2 interface
`MathJax.Hub.Queue`; the page logs "Cannot read properties of undefined
(reading 'Queue')" on every XML galley. The test fixture has no formula,
so the typesetting loss follows from the code. Live-probed 2026-09-25,
note q8, two runs.

<a id="fn-f-ojs10"></a>
**f-ojs10** — Note n: the search phrase is built from the keyword
entries without their names ("Array Array"), and the query filters to
articles outside a published issue; nothing is logged.
Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q14.

<a id="fn-f-ojs11"></a>
**f-ojs11** — Note h: CSL numbers each IEEE entry in a
`csl-left-margin` block, which the theme's and the plugin's styles hide
("Hide the bibliography number produced by some CSL styles"). OJS's
`citation-block.blade` prints the primary citation through
`ViewHelper::sanitizeHtml()`, which drops that wrapper, so "[1]" shows as
text; OPS's `preprint_details.tpl` prints `{$citation}` as it is, and the
format chosen from the list is inserted with its wrapper on both. Other
numbered formats would carry the same number; only IEEE was read. Test
run 2026-09-25, OJS: the primary citation read "[1]A. Author, “Tidal
Patterns in Coastal Waters”, Coastal Review, vol. 1, no. 1, Sept. 2026,
Accessed: Sept. 25, 2026. Available: {address}" where the chosen IEEE
citation had read the same without "[1]"; a separate drive the same
day read "[1]" before the journal's primary IEEE citation and
none before the preprint server's.

<a id="fn-f-ops1"></a>
**f-ops1** — Note f: `preprint_details.tpl` shows the outdated notice
whenever the shown publication is not the current one, previews
included; the date it names is the day of the preview, the unpublished
version having no publication date of its own. Live-probed 2026-09-25,
note q3.

<a id="fn-f-ops2"></a>
**f-ops2** — Note f: `PreprintHandler::initialize()` overwrites the first
remaining argument (the galley or "version") with the URL Path; and
`PreprintHandler::view()` redirects a galley with no reader to
`download` with `$preprint->getId()`, the number, so every such download
passes through the broken redirect and ends at a `download` with no
galley. Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note q2): on the URL-Path preprint the
HTML link went from `…/view/probe-path/{galley}` to
`…/download/{number}/{galley}` to `…/download/probe-path`, "404 Not
Found", while the PDF opened its reader.

<a id="fn-f-ops3"></a>
**f-ops3** — Note f: OJS's `elseif (ctype_digit($galleyId) && $galley->getId() == $galleyId)`
redirect has no OPS counterpart. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q10.

<a id="fn-f-ops4"></a>
**f-ops4** — Note o: OPS ships neither plugin; its HTML galleys take the
download path of note e. Live-probed 2026-09-25, notes q8 and q16.

<a id="fn-f-ops5"></a>
**f-ops5** — Note d: OPS's locale files (app and lib/pkp) have neither
`article.return` nor `issue.return`, so the screen-reader text renders as
the key in `##` marks. Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note d), also on the
French page.

<a id="fn-f-ops6"></a>
**f-ops6** — Note j. The landing page's own "DOI:" line reads the
publication's DOI object instead and is unaffected. Live-probed
2026-09-25, note j.

<a id="fn-f-ops7"></a>
**f-ops7** — Note c: `preprint.subject` has an empty translation in
OPS's `locale/fr_CA/locale.po`. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q5.

<a id="fn-f-ops8"></a>
**f-ops8** — Note d: `article.pageTitle` is absent from OPS's French
locale. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note d.

<a id="fn-f-ops9"></a>
**f-ops9** — Note j: the element at the cover's centre is the keyword
list laid over it. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note j, two runs.
