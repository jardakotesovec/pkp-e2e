# Article landing page & reading {OJS OPS}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

Every published article has a public page of its own, its **landing
page**: the page a reader reaches from an issue's table of contents, the
home page, a category page, a search result, a link someone shared or
the article's address typed by hand. It shows what the article is (title,
contributors, abstract, keywords, dates and versions, references, how to
cite it) and lists the article's galleys, the files a reader opens: a PDF
opens in a reader page, a journal's HTML full text in a reader page of its
own, anything else downloads. This spec describes that
page, its addresses and versions, the galley readers, the "How to Cite"
block and its settings, the extra blocks a journal can switch on, the
open peer reviews a journal marks public (which the page never shows), and the
short summary of an article that the listing pages print. On a preprint
server the page is the preprint's page, and "Published" reads "Posted".
<sup>a</sup>

Several blocks on the page are described by the feature that fills them:
the contributors and their biographies
([Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md)),
the "License", "Data Availability Statement" and "Funding Statement"
blocks ([Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md)), "Funders"
([Funding](U43-funding.md)), a journal's "URN"
([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)), a journal's comments blocks
([Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md)),
a journal's "JATS XML" link (*JATS & Body Text*) and a journal's
Crossmark button and "Cited by" block (*DOIs*). A press's book page is a separate feature, *Monograph landing
page*. <sup>a</sup>

## Actors & permissions

The page is public: a **visitor** needs no account, and signing in, as a
Reader or in any other role, changes nothing in a published version's
page content except the comments blocks
([Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md)).
A journal that requires visitors to sign in ("Users must be registered
and log in to view the journal site."; "…to view the server site." on a
preprint server) or that the Site Administrator has not enabled sends a
signed-out visitor who opens an article's page or a galley's address to
the Login page; a signed-in Reader of the journal reads it. Both settings
are described in
[Journal identity & about pages](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md)
(its Settings bullets 7 and 8). On a journal that sells subscriptions,
what a visitor may open is *Subscriptions & open access control*'s.

## Fields & validation

<a id="page"></a>
**The landing page.** Two columns: the main column with the article's
text, and beside it a narrower column with the files and the details. A
part appears only when the version has something to put in it (Rule 6).
Top to bottom, the main column holds: <sup>c</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Breadcrumb** | — | Journal: "Home / Archives / {issue} / {section}", the issue left out for an article in no issue; preprint server: "Home / {section}" ("Home / Preprints" on the seeded server). "Home", "Archives" and the issue are links. <sup>c</sup> |
| **Notices** | — | The preview notice (Rule 4) or the older-version notice (Rule 5). |
| **Label line** {OPS} | — | Above the title: "Preprint / {date} ({version name})" (Rule 9). |
| **Title**, **subtitle** | — | The version's title as the page heading, its subtitle under it. <sup>c</sup> |
| **Contributors** | — | The contributor list described in [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md), its Rule 14. |
| **"DOI:"** | — | The version's DOI as its full address ("https://doi.org/…"), a link. Which DOI an older version shows, and how a version gets one, is *DOIs*'. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Keywords:"** | — | The version's keywords in the interface language, joined by commas, as plain text. They come in no fixed order, not always the order they were typed in ⚠ [A11](#a11). The label is a raw code on a preprint server's French page [OPS7](#ops7). <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Abstract"** | — | The abstract, as formatted in the editor. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Plain Language Summary"** | — | The plain language summary, under its own heading. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Downloads"** | — | The chart of Rule 17, only when the theme is set to show one. |
| **"Author Biography"** / **"Author Biographies"** | — | Described in [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md), its Rule 14. |
| **"References"** | — | Rule 18. |
| **"Comments on this publication"** {OJS} | — | Described in [Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md). |
| **Recommendations** {OJS} | — | Under the article, the lists of Rule 20 when their plugins are on; neither list ever appears [OJS4](#ojs4) [OJS10](#ojs10). <sup>n</sup> |

The side column, top to bottom on a journal: <sup>c</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Cover image** | — | The version's cover image. On a journal, an article with no cover image of its own in an issue with a cover shows the issue's cover instead, as a link to the issue's page. <sup>c</sup> <sup>q6</sup> |
| **Galley links** | — | The main galleys (Rule 10). |
| **"JATS XML"** {OJS} | — | A link to the article's JATS XML, while it is public (*JATS & Body Text*). |
| **Additional files** | — | The galleys of supplementary components (Rule 10). |
| **"Published"** ("Posted") | — | The date line of Rule 7. |
| **"Versions"** | — | The list of Rule 8. |
| **"Data Availability Statement"**, **"Funding Statement"** | — | Described in [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md), its Rule 15. |
| **"Issue"** {OJS} | — | The issue's name ("Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)"), a link to the issue's page. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Section"** {OJS} | — | The section's name, plain text. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Categories"** | — | The version's categories, each a link to that category's page. A preprint server names a subcategory "{parent} > {subcategory}"; a journal prints the subcategory's own name. <sup>c</sup> <sup>q6</sup> |
| **"Article Number"** {OJS} | — | The version's article number, plain text. <sup>c</sup> |
| **"Funders"** | — | Described in [Funding](U43-funding.md), its Rule 9. |
| **"Comments"** {OJS} | — | Described in [Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md). |
| **"URN"** {OJS} | — | Described in [Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md), its Rule 21. |
| **"License"** | — | Described in [Publication metadata](U40-publication-metadata.md), its Rule 15. |
| **"How to Cite"** | — | Rule 15, at the foot of the column. On a preprint server it sits right after "Categories", above the statements. <sup>q6</sup> |
| **Publication Facts** {OJS} | — | The panel of Rule 19, which never appears [OJS5](#ojs5). <sup>q6</sup> |
| **"Cited by"** {OJS} | — | Described in [DOIs](U45-dois.md#cited-by), its Rule 42a; the column's last block, after the Crossmark button. |

On a preprint server the side column runs: cover image, galley links,
additional files, "Posted", "Versions", "Categories", "How to Cite", "Data
Availability Statement", "Funding Statement", "Funders", "License". <sup>c</sup>

**The PDF reader page.** Opened from a PDF galley (Rule 11). A bar across
the top holds a return arrow, the version's title and a "Download" button;
under it the PDF fills the page in a viewer with its own page, zoom, search
and print controls, a sidebar of page thumbnails, drawing and highlighting
tools ("Highlight", "Text", "Draw", "Add or edit images") and a "Save"
that downloads the file. On an older version's galley an outdated-version
notice sits between the bar and the viewer (Rule 12). The browser tab
reads "View of {title}"; on a French page a journal's reads "Vue de
{title}" and a preprint server's "##article.pageTitle##" ⚠ [OPS8](#ops8).
<sup>d</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Return arrow** | — | An arrow with no visible text. A screen reader reads "Return to Issue Details" for a journal article in an issue ⚠ [OJS6](#ojs6), "Return to Article Details" for one in no issue, and "##article.return##" on a preprint server ⚠ [OPS5](#ops5). Opens the article's page. <sup>d</sup> |
| **Title** | — | The galley's version's title, a link to the article's page. <sup>d</sup> |
| **"Download"** | — | Downloads the PDF under its file name. A screen reader reads "Download PDF". <sup>d</sup> |

**The HTML reader page** {OJS}. Opened from an HTML galley (Rule 11): the
same bar with the return arrow ("Return to Article Details") and the
title, no "Download", and the HTML full text filling the page under it.
The title is the current version's, even on an older version's galley.
<sup>e</sup> <sup>q9</sup>

<a id="how-to-cite"></a>
**The "How to Cite" block.** Shown while the "Citation Style Language"
plugin is on (Settings bullet 4). <sup>h</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **"How to Cite"** | — | The heading, then the citation of the shown version in the journal's primary format (APA until a manager chooses another, Rule 16). <sup>h</sup> |
| **"More Citation Formats"** | — | A button that opens a list of the formats the journal offers: "ABNT", "ACM", "ACS", "AMA", "APA", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "MLA", "Turabian", "Vancouver" on a new journal (Rule 15a). With none offered it opens nothing (Rule 16, [A9](#a9)). <sup>h</sup> |
| **"Download Citation"** | — | Under the formats, inside the same list, while at least one download format is on: "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" and "BibTeX" on a new journal (Rule 15b). <sup>h</sup> |

**The "Citation Style Language" settings window.** Settings › Website ›
"Plugins" › "Installed Plugins", the "Citation Style Language" row's
"Settings" (the row offers it only while the plugin is on). <sup>i</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Citation Format** | No | "Select which citation format you would like to display by default on your article landing page." One choice per format, as listed above. On a new journal none is chosen and the page uses APA. <sup>i</sup> <sup>q12</sup> |
| **Additional Citation Formats** | No | "Select which additional formats you'd like to offer your readers." A box per format, all ticked on a new journal. <sup>i</sup> |
| **Downloadable Formats** | No | "Select which downloadable formats you'd like to offer your readers. Downloadable formats are typically used for importing into third-party bibliography management software, like EndNote or Zotero." The two download formats, both ticked on a new journal. <sup>i</sup> |
| **Publisher Location** | No | Under 'Some citation formats request the geographic location of the publisher, such as "London, U.K.".' Any text; empty on a new journal. <sup>i</sup> |
| **OK** / **Cancel** | — | "OK" stores all four, closes the window and shows "Your changes have been saved."; "Cancel" stores nothing and asks nothing. The window's "Close" after a change asks "The data on this form has changed. Do you wish to continue without saving?", and leaving the page asks the browser's "Leave site?"; nothing is stored either way. <sup>i</sup> <sup>q12</sup> |

**The "Publication Facts Label plugin" settings window** {OJS}. The
plugin row's "Settings". It opens with the warning "Funding Plugin Not
Present" ⚠ [OJS2](#ojs2), then these fields. Its "OK", "Cancel" and
"Close" behave as the "Citation Style Language" window's. When "OK" is
refused, the window stays open with the message, but its fields show the
values saved before: whatever was just typed or ticked is gone
⚠ [OJS7](#ojs7). <sup>k</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Society name or acronym**, **URL** | No | Under "Journal Information". Meant for the panel's "Society" row, the name linked to the address [OJS5](#ojs5). An address that is not a web address is refused in the window with "Please enter a valid URL." under the box, and nothing is saved. <sup>k</sup> <sup>q15</sup> |
| **Start Date** | No | Under "Exclude by Date": articles submitted before it are meant to get no panel (Rule 19). A date picker (year-month-day); letters cannot be typed. An impossible date such as "2026-99-99" is not refused: "OK" shows "Your changes have been saved." and stores no start date, and the box is empty when the window reopens ⚠ [OJS8](#ojs8). <sup>k</sup> |
| **Directory of Open Access Journals**, **Google Scholar**, **Latindex**, **MEDLINE** | No | Under "Automated Listing of Indexes in the PFL". Each ticked index is meant to be listed under the panel's "Indexed in". The journal's listing in DOAJ, Latindex and MEDLINE is checked against the index on "OK"; a listing the check cannot confirm is refused, in a notice and not beside the box, with "The journal's indexing in {index} could not be verified. Ensure that your journal is indexed and the appropriate ISSN is configured in Journal Settings." <sup>k</sup> <sup>q15</sup> |
| **Scopus** and **Web of Science** "URL" | No | Under "Manual Listing of Indexes in the PFL", each with its steps. A Scopus address must have the form of a Scopus source page, a Web of Science address must start with the Master Journal List's address; otherwise "The Scopus URL you entered is not correct. Please read the instructions and try again." ("The Web of Science URL you entered is not correct. Please read the instructions and try again."). <sup>k</sup> <sup>q15</sup> |

<a id="summary"></a>
**The article summary.** How the listing pages show one article: an
issue's table of contents (*Issues*), a journal's "Latest Publications"
and a preprint server's "Latest preprints" on the home page
([Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), Rules 13 and 16),
a preprint server's "Archives" page (the main menu's "Archives") and
section pages (*Sections*), category
pages (*Categories*) and search results ([Search](U15-search.md), Rule 6).
Top to bottom: <sup>j</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Cover image** | — | The current version's cover image, a link to the article's page (Rule 22). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Title** | — | Title and subtitle, a link to the article's page. <sup>j</sup> |
| **Authors** | — | The author line described in [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md), its Rule 15, left out in an issue's table of contents when the section omits author names {OJS} (Settings bullet 10). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Pages** {OJS} | — | The version's pages, when set. <sup>j</sup> |
| **"DOI:"** {OPS} | — | Meant to show the preprint's DOI as a link; never shows ⚠ [OPS6](#ops6). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Keywords** {OPS} | — | The current version's keywords, one after another, in no fixed order [A11](#a11). <sup>j</sup> |
| **Details line** {OPS} | — | "Downloads: {count} - Submitted {date} - Posted {date}", then " - Versions: {count}" once more than one version is posted. <sup>j</sup> |
| **Date** {OJS} | — | The publication date, on search results only. <sup>j</sup> |
| **Galley links** | — | As on the landing page (Rule 10), except on search results and category pages, which leave them out (Rule 22). |

## Rules & state

1. **The page's address.** The article's page lives at the journal's
   address followed by "article/view/" ("preprint/view/") and the
   article's number, or its **URL Path** once one is set on the Publication
   Settings page (a preprint server's "Preprint entry" page;
   [Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md)).
   With a URL Path set, an address that uses the number forwards to the
   URL Path one, keeping any galley or version part that followed the
   number ⚠ [OPS2](#ops2). <sup>f</sup> <sup>q2</sup>
2. **Which version the page shows.** The article's address shows the
   **current version**: the most recently published one. Each older
   published version has an address of its own, reached from the
   "Versions" list (Rule 8): the article's address followed by
   "/version/" and an id the "Versions" link carries, not the version's
   number ("…/version/68" for "Version of Record 1.0"). The current
   version's own such address opens the same page as the article's
   address. A version address naming an id the article has no published
   version under (a mistyped one, or another article's version) answers
   the "404 Not Found" page on a preprint server; on a journal it fails
   with a server error
   ([→ Publish, schedule & versions, OJS3](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#ojs3)).
   <sup>f</sup> <sup>q2</sup>
3. **Nothing published, no page.** While an article has no published
   version (a scheduled article included), its address answers the "404
   Not Found" page to a visitor and a Reader. So does the own address
   of a version not yet published (a new version's "Preview" opens it,
   Rule 4) or no longer published (Rule 7b), and a number or URL Path
   matching no article of the journal. <sup>f</sup> <sup>q3</sup>
   <sup>g</sup>
4. **The preview.** An unpublished version's page opens for those
   Actors row 2 names under the notice "This is a preview and has not
   been published. View submission". It looks as it will once published,
   except that it has no "Published" ("Posted") line and no "Versions"
   list. On a preprint server the label line names the preview day and
   the version's name as it stands ("Preprint / 2026-09-25 (Author
   Original 1.2)"). "View submission" opens the submission's workflow on
   its current stage for those whose workflow offers "Preview"; the
   submission's Author gets the access-denied page instead ("The current
   role does not have access to this operation.") ⚠ [A5](#a5). On a
   preprint server, previewing a new version while an
   earlier one is posted adds the older-version notice of Rule 5 under
   it ⚠ [OPS1](#ops1).
   <sup>f</sup> <sup>q3</sup>
5. **An older version's notice.** An older version's page opens with
   "This is an outdated version published on {date}. Read the most recent
   version.", the date being that version's own; "most recent version"
   opens the article's address. The page is headed with the older
   version's title, but the browser tab reads the current version's
   title ⚠ [A6](#a6).
   <sup>f</sup> <sup>q4</sup>
6. **Empty parts are left out.** Every part of the page's tables appears
   only when the version has something to put in it: an article with only
   a title, one contributor and an abstract shows the breadcrumb, the
   title, the contributor, "Abstract", "Published" and "Versions", on a
   journal also "Section" (and "Issue", with the issue's cover, when it is
   in an issue that has one), and no other heading.
   <sup>c</sup> <sup>q6</sup>
7. **The date line.** Under "Published" ("Posted"): the first
   version's page, its date; a later version's, "{first date} —
   Updated on {its own date}". The first date is the earliest of the
   article's versions, published or not (Rule 7b); while a version is
   prepared, its creation day (Rule 7a).
   <sup>g</sup> <sup>q5</sup>
   - 7a. **A version being prepared.** Creating it rewrites every
     published version's line: versions of 2026-09-01 and 2026-09-24,
     then one created 2026-09-25, give "Published 2026-09-25 — Updated
     on 2026-09-24" on the current page and "Published 2026-09-25 —
     Updated on 2026-09-01" on the first's
     ([→ Publish, schedule & versions, A6](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#a6)).
   - 7b. **An unpublished first version.** The first version goes
     offline while a later one stays published by "Unpublish"
     ("Unpost") on that version, or on a journal by the issue's "Remove"
     on an article whose second version was published with "Don't Assign
     To An Issue" ([→ Issues, A18](U50-issues.md#a18)). With versions
     published 2024-03-01 and 2026-09-28, the page reads "Published
     2024-03-01 — Updated on 2026-09-28" ("Posted 2024-03-03 — Updated
     on 2026-09-28" for a preprint first posted 2024-03-03). Yet
     "Versions" lists only "2026-09-28 (Version of Record 1.1)"
     ("2026-09-28 (Author Original 1.1)"), and the first
     version's own address answers the "404 Not Found" page
     ⚠ [A12](#a12). <sup>g</sup>
8. **The "Versions" list.** Every published version, the newest first,
   each as "{date} ({version name})": "2026-09-24 (Version of Record
   1.0)", on a preprint server "2026-09-24 (Author Original 1.0)". The
   version shown is plain text; the current version links to the
   article's address and each older one to its own address (Rule 2). A
   version not yet published, or unpublished since, is not listed. On a French page the version
   name reads "##publication.versionStage.display##" ⚠ [A1](#a1).
   <sup>g</sup> <sup>q5</sup>
9. **The label line** {OPS}. Above the title, "Preprint / {date} ({version
   name})" names the shown version, its date and its name as in the
   "Versions" list ([A1](#a1) in French). <sup>g</sup>
10. **The galley links.** The side column lists the shown version's
    galleys, in the order of the "Galleys" page
    ([→ Galleys, ordering](U46-galleys.md#order)), in two lists: first
    the **main galleys**, the remote galleys and those whose file is of a
    main component ("Article Text", "Preprint Text"); then (after a
    journal's "JATS XML" link) the **additional files**, those whose file
    is of a supplementary component ("Data Set", "Other" and the rest,
    Settings bullet 11). A galley whose file's component has since been
    made a dependent one (Settings › Workflow › Submission › "Components",
    the component's "These are dependent files…" box; "Image", "HTML
    Stylesheet" and "Multimedia" are, and the galley upload offers none of
    them), or that has neither a file nor a remote address, is not
    listed. The two lists carry no visible heading; a
    screen reader reads "Downloads" and "Additional Files". <sup>e</sup>
    <sup>q7</sup>
    - 10a. **The link text.** Each link reads the galley's label. When the
      galley's language is not the language the page is shown in, the
      language follows in brackets: "HTML (French (Canada))" on an English
      page, "PDF (anglais)" on a French one. <sup>e</sup>
    - 10b. **The link address.** The article's address followed by the
      galley's URL Path, or its number when it has none; on an older
      version's page, the version's own address followed by the same.
      <sup>e</sup>
11. **Opening a galley.** What a galley link does depends on the file:
    <sup>d</sup> <sup>e</sup> <sup>q8</sup>
    - a PDF opens the PDF reader page (Fields), while "PDF.JS PDF Viewer"
      is on (Settings bullet 1);
    - an HTML file {OJS} opens the HTML reader page (Fields), while "HTML
      Article Galley" is on (Settings bullet 2);
    - an XML file {OJS} opens the journal's page with the article laid out
      by the eLife Lens reader, while "eLife Lens Article Viewer" is on
      (Settings bullet 3); the page's own script fails as it loads, so
      formulas cannot be typeset ⚠ [OJS9](#ojs9);
    - any other file, or one whose reader is switched off, downloads under
      its file name, and the browser stays on the article's page. On a
      preprint server an HTML or XML galley always downloads [OPS4](#ops4);
    - a remote galley takes the browser to its remote address.
12. **The readers and older versions.** The return arrow and the title of
    a reader page open the article's address, whichever version the
    galley belongs to. An older version's galley opens its reader under
    the notice "This is an outdated version published on {date}. Read the
    most recent version.", the date written like "2026-09-25" in the PDF
    reader and like "September 25, 2026" in the HTML reader {OJS}. An
    older version's PDF reader shows no document ("0 of 0" in an empty
    viewer, no message), and its "Download" gets no file: the browser
    stays on the reader page ⚠ [A2](#a2).
    <sup>d</sup> <sup>e</sup> <sup>q9</sup>
    - 12a. **A new version's preview.** On the preview of a new,
      unpublished version (Rule 4), the version's "PDF", and on a journal
      its "HTML", open their readers under the same outdated notice,
      though that version is the next one ⚠ [A13](#a13). The PDF reader
      leaves the date blank: "This is an outdated version published on .
      Read the most recent version." The HTML reader {OJS} dates it the
      day the reader is opened: opened on October 4, 2026, it reads "This
      is an outdated version published on October 4, 2026. Read the most
      recent version."
      <sup>q9</sup>
13. **Galley addresses.** On a journal, the number address of a galley
    that has a URL Path forwards to the article's address followed by
    that URL Path, dropping any version part. For a galley of the
    current version that is its own address. For an older version's
    galley, typed after the version's own address
    ("…/version/{id}/{galley number}"), the reader lands on the current
    version's galley with that URL Path, under no outdated-version
    notice, or on the article's page when the current version's galley
    has another URL Path ⚠ [OJS14](#ojs14). On a preprint server every
    number address of a galley that has a URL Path answers the "404 Not
    Found" page ⚠ [OPS3](#ops3). <sup>f</sup> <sup>q10</sup>
    - 13a. **An older galley without the version part.** A galley address
      with no version part that names a galley of an older version only
      opens the article's page when it uses the galley's URL Path (one
      changed since) or the number of a galley that has none. The number
      of such a galley that has a URL Path answers the "404 Not Found"
      page.
    - 13b. **No such galley.** A galley address that names no galley of
      the article answers the "404 Not Found" page.
14. **The "Keywords:", "DOI:" and category lines follow the shown
    version.** An older version's page shows that version's keywords and
    categories; its DOI line is *DOIs*' rule. <sup>c</sup>
15. **"How to Cite".** The block (Fields) cites the shown version: its
    title, its contributors and the journal's name (on a preprint server
    the server's name, which "APA" prints as "In {server name}"). Where
    the format prints them it adds the journal's abbreviation ("ACS",
    "AMA", "IEEE" and "Vancouver"; the journal's acronym when no
    abbreviation is set), the issue and the pages {OJS}, the shown
    version's date, and the article's address, which "ABNT" ⚠ [A14](#a14)
    and "ACM" leave out on a journal and "ACM" on a preprint server. An older
    version's page cites that version's title and date with the article's
    own address. On a later version published ("posted") on another day
    than the first, "APA" adds "(Original work published {year})"; on the
    first version's day it adds nothing. "ABNT" runs a preprint's title
    into the server's name and joins the month to the year ⚠ [A7](#a7). <sup>h</sup> <sup>q11</sup>
    - 15a. **Another format.** "More Citation Formats" opens and closes the
      list; choosing a format replaces the citation in place with that
      format's and closes the list, without leaving the page. A reload
      shows the primary format again.
    - 15b. **A download.** "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" or "BibTeX"
      downloads the citation as a file named after the first 60
      characters of the version's title, each space written "+", ending
      ".ris" or ".bib". The RIS file's dates carry a stray "%" ⚠ [A8](#a8).
    - 15c. **An article outside a published issue** {OJS}. On an article
      published with no issue, or published at once into an issue not yet
      published, the primary citation shows. The other formats and the
      downloads work for the Journal Manager and for a Section Editor or
      Copyeditor assigned to the article; for a visitor, a Reader, the
      Author and an unassigned Section Editor a format changes nothing and
      a download opens a blank page (signed out) or the "404 Not Found"
      page (signed in) [OJS1](#ojs1).
16. **The "How to Cite" settings.** After "OK" (Fields), every article's
    page follows at once, the place aside (last bullet): <sup>i</sup> <sup>q12</sup>
    - the chosen "Primary Citation Format" is the citation shown first;
      on a journal an "IEEE" citation shown first opens with its number
      "[1]" ("[1]A. Author, …"), which the same format chosen under "More
      Citation Formats" and a preprint server's page leave out
      ⚠ [OJS11](#ojs11);
    - "More Citation Formats" lists the ticked "Additional Citation
      Formats" alone; with none ticked the button stays and opens nothing
      ⚠ [A9](#a9);
    - "Download Citation" lists the ticked "Downloadable Formats" alone,
      disappearing with its heading when none is ticked;
    - "Publisher Location" is recorded on each article when it is
      published, and its citations print the place recorded then: an
      article published while the box was empty keeps printing no place
      after one is typed, and only articles published afterwards carry
      the new one. An article not published yet shows the box's current
      value. The place is printed only where a format prints a
      publisher's place: no on-screen format prints it for a journal
      article; for a preprint "ABNT", "ACS", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE",
      "Turabian" and "Vancouver" do. The "BibTeX" file carries it on both,
      the RIS file does not.
17. **The "Downloads" chart.** While "Usage statistics display options"
    (Settings bullet 6) is on a chart, the main column carries a section
    headed "Downloads" with a bar or a line chart of the article's
    downloads by month. An article with no downloads yet shows an empty
    chart; the sentence "Download data is not yet available." never
    appears ⚠ [A3](#a3). What counts as a download is *Statistics —
    usage*'s. <sup>l</sup>
<a id="references"></a>
18. **The "References" block.** A section headed "References" lists the
    shown version's references, one paragraph each, in list order, with
    each web address in a reference turned into a link that opens in a
    new tab. It shows each reference's own text, never the structured
    details, and appears whenever the version has references, even after
    the journal switched the References setting off. A version with no
    references shows no "References" heading.
    A trailing "." or "," is left out of a link, but an address written
    inside parentheses takes the closing ")" into its link ⚠ [A10](#a10).
    How references are
    captured, and why data citations never show here, is
    [Citations & references](U42-citations-and-references.md)' (its A11).
    <sup>m</sup>
19. **The Publication Facts Label** {OJS}. While the "Publication Facts
    Label plugin" is on (Settings bullet 7), the side column is meant to
    carry, at its foot, a panel titled "Publication Facts" comparing the
    article with the journal's other articles: "Peer reviewers", "Data
    availability", "External funding", "Competing interests", then for
    the journal "Articles accepted", "Days to publication", "Indexed in",
    "Editorial team list", "Society" and "Publisher". An article in a
    section marked "Will not be peer-reviewed", or submitted before the
    plugin's "Start Date", is meant to get none. The panel never appears:
    every article's page opens normally without it ⚠ [OJS5](#ojs5). On a
    French (Canada) page, and on a page in any other language the plugin
    has no labels of its own for (60 of the 78 languages OJS offers), the
    panel would not show at all ⚠ [OJS3](#ojs3). <sup>k</sup>
    <sup>q13</sup>
20. **Recommendations** {OJS}. Under the article:
    <sup>n</sup> <sup>q14</sup>
    - 20a. **"Most read articles by the same author(s)"**, while "Recommend
      Articles by Author" is on (Settings bullet 8): meant to list the
      journal's other published articles by a contributor of the same
      name, the most read first, ten a page. The list never appears: the
      page of an article whose contributor has another published article
      in the journal opens normally without it ⚠ [OJS4](#ojs4). With no
      such article there is no list either, as intended.
    - 20b. **"Similar Articles"**, while "Recommend Similar Articles" is on
      (Settings bullet 9): meant to list the journal's other published
      articles that hold every word of the article's keywords, ten a page,
      followed by "You may also start an advanced similarity search for
      this article.", whose link runs that search on the Search page. An
      article that shares only one of two keywords would be left out
      ⚠ [OJS13](#ojs13). The list never appears, even for an article whose
      keywords a dozen published articles share ⚠ [OJS10](#ojs10). An
      article with no keywords, or no match, gets no list either, as
      intended.
21. **The page in another language.** Every label on the page follows the
    interface language the visitor chose, except on a preprint server's
    French page, whose keywords label reads "##preprint.subject## :"
    where the English page reads "Keywords:" ⚠ [OPS7](#ops7) (and the
    version names of Rule 8), and in a language marked incomplete
    (Rule 21a). The article's own texts show in that
    language where the version has them. The contributor list, with the role under each
    name, is described in
    [Contributors & affiliations](U41-contributors-and-affiliations.md).
    <sup>c</sup> <sup>q5</sup>
    - 21a. **A language marked incomplete.** The site's list of languages
      (Administration › Site Settings › "Languages") marks a language
      with "*" and the line "Marked locales may be incomplete.". On a
      page in such a language, a label its translation lacks shows its
      raw key. On a Japanese page the breadcrumb's "/" reads
      "##navigation.breadcrumbSeparator##", and a preprint server's
      label line reads "##common.publication##" for "Preprint" and its
      date line "##submissions.published##" for "Posted". A Spanish
      (Mexico) page shows more than a dozen such keys, among them
      "##submission.updatedOn##" in place of a later version's dates,
      "##submission.versions##" for "Versions", and
      "##submission.outdatedVersion##" in place of an older version's
      whole notice.
22. **The article summary** (Fields). The title and cover open the
    article's address, except where the summary's text lies over the
    cover, on a screen 768 px wide or wider: on a preprint server's lists
    the author line, keywords and details line cover a band from just
    under the title to just under the "Downloads" line (about the middle
    half of a square cover), on a journal's lists the author line covers
    its own row; a press there opens nothing ⚠ [OPS9](#ops9).
    On search results and category pages the summary leaves out the
    galleys. An issue's table of contents, the home page's "Current Issue"
    included, lists only the main galleys. A journal's "Latest
    Publications" holds only the articles outside a published issue
    (published with no issue, or into an issue not yet published;
    [Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), its Rule 13),
    so an article in a published issue is listed under that issue
    instead. "Latest Publications" too lists only the main galleys while
    the home page also shows the current issue ("Include the current
    issue's table of contents" under the theme's "Journal Content
    Organization"). Without it,
    and on a preprint server's lists,
    every galley of the current version is shown, one with no file
    included, whose link answers the "404 Not Found" page ⚠ [A4](#a4).
    <sup>j</sup> <sup>q7</sup>
23. **Open peer review** {OJS}. The page carries no reviews. An "Open"
    review can be made public: "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" ticked
    in the reviewer row's "Edit" before "Mark as Complete", whose dialog
    then adds "This review will be made publicly visible alongside the
    article."
    ([→ Reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#read-review),
    its Rule 14a). Once the article is published, its page shows neither
    that review's comments, nor the reviewer's name, nor any review
    heading, to a visitor, a Reader or the Journal Manager. The page reads
    as for an article whose review was left private ⚠ [OJS12](#ojs12).
    <sup>p</sup>

A preprint server can also mark a preprint as published elsewhere, with a
notice above the title; that notice belongs to *Preprint relations*
{OPS}. <sup>a</sup>

## Side effects

- **Usage statistics.** Each opening of an article's page and each galley
  download or reader opening is recorded for the journal's usage
  statistics (*Statistics — usage*), which the "Downloads" chart and the
  preprint summary's "Downloads: {count}" read once the statistics are
  processed; the test installs never process them. <sup>l</sup>
- **No email, no notice.** Reading the page, opening a galley or
  downloading a citation sends no email and leaves no notice. <sup>b</sup>
- **The citation settings.** "OK" in the "Citation Style Language"
  settings window shows "Your changes have been saved." and changes every
  article's page of the journal at once (Rule 16). <sup>i</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

1. **"PDF.JS PDF Viewer"** (Settings › Website › "Plugins" › "Installed
   Plugins", "Generic Plugins"). On for a new journal and preprint
   server: a PDF galley opens the PDF reader page (Rule 11). Off: it
   downloads. <sup>o</sup> <sup>q16</sup>
2. **{OJS} "HTML Article Galley"** (same list). On for a new journal: an
   HTML galley opens the HTML reader page. Off: it downloads (Rule 11). A
   preprint server has no such plugin. <sup>o</sup>
3. **{OJS} "eLife Lens Article Viewer"** (same list). On for a new
   journal: an article's XML galley opens in the Lens reader, while an
   issue's XML galley (a "Full Issue" link on the issue's page,
   [Issues](U50-issues.md), its Rule 26) downloads all the same
   ⚠ [OJS15](#ojs15). Off: both download (Rule 11). A preprint server
   has no such plugin. <sup>o</sup>
4. **"Citation Style Language"** (same list). Off for a new journal and
   preprint server: no "How to Cite" block. On: the block of Rule 15, and
   the plugin row's "Settings". Ticking the row shows "The plugin
   "Citation Style Language" has been enabled."; unticking asks "Are you
   sure you want to disable this plugin?" ("OK" / "Cancel"), then shows
   "The plugin "Citation Style Language" has been disabled.". The
   plugin's settings are kept while it is off: ticked again, the window
   and the block return as they were left. <sup>o</sup> <sup>i</sup>
5. **The "Citation Style Language" "Settings" window** (bullet 4's
   "Settings"). On a new journal: no primary format chosen (APA shown),
   every additional format and both download formats ticked, no publisher
   location. Each field's effect: Rule 16. <sup>i</sup>
6. **"Usage statistics display options"** (Settings › Website ›
   "Appearance" › "Theme",
   [Appearance & theming](U10-appearance-and-theming.md), its Rule 9). "Do
   not display submission usage statistics chart for reader." on a new
   journal: no chart. "Use bar type of the chart for usage statistics
   display." or "Use line type of the chart for usage statistics
   display.": the "Downloads" section of Rule 17. <sup>l</sup>
7. **{OJS} "Publication Facts Label plugin"** (same list as bullet 1). Off
   for a new journal: no panel. On: the panel of Rule 19 (never shown
   [OJS5](#ojs5)), and its "Settings" window (Fields). A section's "Will
   not be peer-reviewed" (Settings › Journal › "Sections", *Sections*),
   unticked on the seeded sections and on a new journal's "Articles", is
   meant to keep the panel off its articles. <sup>o</sup> <sup>k</sup>
8. **{OJS} "Recommend Articles by Author"** (same list). Off for a new
   journal. On: Rule 20a (the list never shown [OJS4](#ojs4)).
   <sup>o</sup>
9. **{OJS} "Recommend Similar Articles"** (same list). Off for a new
   journal. On: Rule 20b (the list never shown [OJS10](#ojs10)).
   <sup>o</sup>
10. **{OJS} A section's "Omit author names for section items from issues'
    table of contents."** (Settings › Journal › "Sections", *Sections*).
    Unticked on the seeded sections and on a new section: the article
    summary carries the author line. Ticked: an issue's table of
    contents, and the home page's "Current Issue", list the section's
    articles without it; "Latest Publications", category pages and search
    results still show it (Fields, the article summary). A preprint
    server's section form has no such box. <sup>j</sup>
11. **A component's "These are supplementary files, such as data sets and
    research materials, and will be displayed separately from the main
    publication files."** (Settings › Workflow › Submission ›
    "Components", the component row's "Settings" › "Edit"). Ticked on a new journal for
    "Research Instrument", "Research Materials", "Research Results",
    "Transcripts", "Data Analysis", "Data Set", "Source Texts",
    "Multimedia" and "Other"; a galley of such a component is listed under
    the additional files (Rule 10). "Multimedia" is also a dependent
    component, which the galley upload never offers. <sup>e</sup>
12. **Settings other features describe.** The journal's publishing mode,
    subscriptions and article access (*Subscriptions & open access
    control*), "Enable Public Comments"
    ([Reader comments & moderation](U14-reader-comments-and-moderation.md)),
    a version's public JATS XML (*JATS & Body Text*), the DOI settings and
    the Crossref plugin (*DOIs*), and the URN plugin
    ([Identifiers](U44-identifiers.md)) each add or gate a part of this
    page; their rules are there.

## Canonical scenarios

Every scenario reads articles published for it. Scenarios 1 and 4 run on
the seeded journal (preprint server), scenario 4 with ready accounts; the
others run on scratch journals (preprint servers) with throwaway
accounts. The accounts, their passwords and the tooling recipe are in the
footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **A published article's page**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, and two articles published on the
   seeded journal (preprint server): "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters",
   in the issue "Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)" and the section "Articles" (the
   section "Preprints" on a preprint server), with the subtitle "A field
   study", the keywords "tide" and "current", an abstract, the plain
   language summary "How tides move along a coast.", a cover image, the
   category "Engineering" (a subcategory of "Applied Science"), on a
   journal the article number "e42", the two references "Smith, J.
   (2020). Ridge data. https://example.org/ridge." and "Jones, K. (2021).
   Coastal survey.", and a galley "PDF"; and "Harbour Notes", in no
   issue, with only a title, one contributor and an abstract.

   - **The main column**: open "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters" at
     {journal address}/article/view/{number} ("preprint/view/" on a
     preprint server; {number} is the article's number). The breadcrumb
     reads "Home / Archives / Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014) / Articles", with
     "Home", "Archives" and "Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)" as links ("Home /
     Preprints" on a preprint server). On a preprint server a label line
     above the title reads "Preprint / " followed by the date and the
     version name of the "Versions" entry in the side column. The page is
     headed "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters", with "A field study"
     under it; below the contributors come "Keywords: tide, current" or
     "Keywords: current, tide" (either order passes, [A11](#a11)) as
     plain text, "Abstract" with the abstract, and "Plain Language
     Summary" with "How tides move along a coast." (Fields, the landing
     page; Rules 6, 9).
   - **"References"**: further down, a section headed "References" lists
     "Smith, J. (2020). Ridge data. https://example.org/ridge." and
     "Jones, K. (2021). Coastal survey." as two paragraphs, in that
     order. "https://example.org/ridge" is a link that opens in a new
     tab, and the final "." is not part of it (Rule 18).
   - **The side column**: top to bottom it shows the cover image, the
     galley link "PDF", "Published" ("Posted" on a preprint server) over
     a date, and "Versions" with one entry, "{that date} (Version of
     Record 1.0)" ("Author Original 1.0" on a preprint server), as plain
     text; on a journal then "Issue" with "Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014)" as a link
     and "Section" with "Articles" as plain text; then "Categories" with
     "Engineering" as a link ("Applied Science > Engineering" on a
     preprint server); and on a journal "Article Number" with "e42" as
     plain text (Fields, the side column; Rule 8).
   - **The links in the side column**: on a journal, press "Vol. 1 No. 2
     (2014)" under "Issue": the issue's page opens. Back on the article,
     press the category under "Categories": that category's page opens
     (Fields, the side column).
   - **An article with little in it**: open "Harbour Notes": the page
     shows the breadcrumb ("Home / Archives / Articles" on a journal, the
     issue left out), the title, the contributor, "Abstract", "Published"
     ("Posted") and "Versions", on a journal also "Section", and no other
     heading (Rule 6; Fields, "Breadcrumb").
   - **Control**: "Harbour Notes" shows no "Keywords:", no "Plain Language
     Summary", no "Categories" and no cover image, all of which "Tidal
     Patterns in Coastal Waters" shows (Rule 6). <sup>s</sup>

2. **Opening each galley**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   at its install settings, with two published articles: "Tidal
   Patterns", carrying the galleys "PDF" (the file "article.pdf", with
   the URL Path "pdf"), "HTML" (the file "article.html"), on a journal
   "XML" (the file "article.xml"), "Remote" (hosted at
   "https://example.org/paper") and "Data" (the file "notes.md", of the
   component "Data Set"), the files on a preprint server being
   "preprint.pdf", "preprint.html" and "not-an-image.txt"; and "Harbour
   Currents", with the URL Path "harbour-currents" and a galley "PDF" of
   its own, with no URL Path.

   - **The two lists**: open "Tidal Patterns" at {journal
     address}/article/view/{number} ("preprint/view/" on a preprint
     server): the side column lists "PDF", "HTML", on a journal "XML",
     and "Remote" in one list, then "Data" alone in a second list below
     it. Neither list has a visible heading; a screen reader reads
     "Downloads" over the first and "Additional Files" over the second.
     The "PDF" link's address is the article's address followed by
     "/pdf", the "HTML" link's the article's address followed by "/" and
     a number (Rules 10, 10b).
   - **The PDF reader**: press "PDF": the PDF reader page opens. A bar
     across the top holds an arrow, the title "Tidal Patterns" and a
     "Download" button, which a screen reader reads "Download PDF"; under
     it the PDF fills the page in a viewer with its own page, zoom,
     search and print controls. The browser tab reads "View of Tidal
     Patterns". Press "Download": "article.pdf" ("preprint.pdf")
     downloads. Press the title: the article's page opens. Go back and
     press the arrow: the article's page opens again (Fields, the PDF
     reader page; Rules 11, 12).
   - **The HTML galley**: on a journal, press "HTML": the HTML reader
     page opens, with the same bar holding the arrow, which a screen
     reader reads "Return to Article Details", and the title, no
     "Download", and the HTML full text under it; press the arrow: the
     article's page opens. On a preprint server "HTML" downloads
     "preprint.html" and the browser stays on the preprint's page
     ([OPS4](#ops4)) (Fields, the HTML reader page; Rule 11).
   - **The XML galley** {OJS}: press "XML": a page of the journal opens
     with the article of "article.xml" laid out by the eLife Lens reader,
     its text showing ([OJS9](#ojs9)) (Rule 11).
   - **A file with no reader**: press "Data": "notes.md"
     ("not-an-image.txt") downloads, and the browser stays on the
     article's page (Rule 11).
   - **The remote galley**: press "Remote": the browser goes to
     "https://example.org/paper" (Rule 11).
   - **No such galley**: type the article's address followed by
     "/nosuchgalley": the "404 Not Found" page (Rule 13b).
   - **An article's URL Path**: type {journal address}/article/view/{number}
     with "Harbour Currents"'s number ("preprint/view/" on a preprint
     server): the browser lands on {journal
     address}/article/view/harbour-currents, that article's page. On a
     journal, its "PDF" link's address reads {journal
     address}/article/view/harbour-currents/ followed by a number; type
     {journal address}/article/view/{number}/ followed by that number:
     the browser lands on the "PDF" link's address, and the PDF reader
     page opens ([OPS2](#ops2)) (Rule 1).
   - **Control**: "Tidal Patterns", which has no URL Path, stays at its
     number address (Rule 1). <sup>s</sup>

3. **An older version beside the current one**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   with "Citation Style Language" on, and an article published twice,
   both times today ({today} below, the day the scenario runs): its
   first version, titled "Tidal Patterns", on a journal in the published
   issue "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)", and its current version, titled "Tidal
   Patterns Revised"; each version carries a galley "PDF" and, on a
   journal, a galley "HTML".

   - **The current version's page**: open the article's address: the
     page is headed "Tidal Patterns Revised", and under "Published"
     ("Posted") reads "{today} — Updated on {today}". "Versions" lists
     two entries, the newest first: the current version's as plain
     text, then "{today} (Version of Record 1.0)" ("Author Original 1.0"
     on a preprint server) as a link. On a preprint server the label
     line above the title reads "Preprint / " followed by the date and
     name of the current version's entry. The "APA" citation under "How
     to Cite" names "Tidal Patterns Revised" (Rules 7, 8, 9, 15).
   - **The older version's page**: press "{today} (Version of Record
     1.0)": the address is the article's address followed by "/version/"
     and a number, and the page opens under "This is an outdated version
     published on {today}. Read the most recent version.", headed "Tidal
     Patterns". In "Versions" that entry is now plain text and the
     current version's a link. The "PDF" link's address begins with this
     page's address. "How to Cite" cites "Tidal Patterns" with the
     article's own address, which has no "/version/" in it (Rules 2, 5,
     8, 10b, 15).
   - **"most recent version"**: press "most recent version" in the
     notice: the article's address opens, headed "Tidal Patterns
     Revised" (Rule 5).
   - **The older version's PDF reader**: go back to the older version's
     page and press "PDF": the PDF reader page shows the title "Tidal
     Patterns" and, between the bar and the viewer, "This is an outdated
     version published on {today}. Read the most recent version.", the
     date written like "2026-09-25" ([A2](#a2)). Press the arrow: the
     article's address opens (Rule 12; Fields, the PDF reader page).
   - **The older version's HTML reader** {OJS}: on the older version's
     page press "HTML": the HTML reader page shows the same notice with
     the date written like "September 25, 2026", and its bar reads the
     current version's title, "Tidal Patterns Revised". Press the title:
     the article's address opens (Rule 12; Fields, the HTML reader page).
   - **A version that does not exist** {OPS}: type the article's address
     followed by "/version/999999": the "404 Not Found" page. A journal
     fails there with a server error instead
     ([→ Publish, schedule & versions, OJS3](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md#ojs3))
     (Rule 2).
   - **The home page's summary** {OPS}: on the preprint server's home
     page, the preprint's summary under "Latest preprints" ends its
     details line with " - Versions: 2" (Fields, the article summary).
   - **Control**: the article's address shows no "This is an outdated
     version…" notice (Rule 5). <sup>s</sup>

4. **An unpublished article: the preview, and "404 Not Found" for
   everyone else**

   Given: the Journal Manager, the Author, the Reader and a visitor,
   signed out, on the seeded journal (preprint server), with the
   Author's article "Tidal Draft" submitted and in Production, never
   published ({number} below is its number), and, on a journal, an
   article scheduled into the unpublished issue "Vol. 2 No. 1 (2015)".

   - **The visitor**: open {journal address}/article/view/{number}
     ("preprint/view/" on a preprint server): the "404 Not Found" page.
     On a journal the scheduled article's address answers the same, and
     so, on both, does {journal address}/article/view/no-such-article
     (Rule 3; Actors row 2).
   - **The Reader**: signed in, the Reader opens the same addresses:
     "404 Not Found" each time (Rule 3; Actors row 2).
   - **The Journal Manager's "Preview"**: open "Tidal Draft" from the
     Dashboard and press "Preview" in the workflow's header: the
     article's page opens under "This is a preview and has not been
     published. View submission", headed "Tidal Draft", with no
     "Published" ("Posted") line and no "Versions" list (Rule 4; Actors
     row 2).
   - **"View submission"**: press "View submission": the article's
     workflow opens on its current stage, Production (Rule 4).
   - **The Author**: signed in, the Author opens "Tidal Draft" with
     "View" on My Submissions: its workflow offers no "Preview". The
     Author types the article's address: the same preview opens, under
     the same notice ([A5](#a5)) (Actors row 2; Rule 4).
   - **Control**: the address the Journal Manager's "Preview" opened is
     {journal address}/article/view/{number}, the address that answered
     "404 Not Found" to the visitor and the Reader (Rules 3, 4).
     <sup>s</sup>

5. **A journal closed to visitors**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, and two scratch journals (preprint
   servers), each with a Reader and a published article "Tidal
   Patterns" carrying a galley "PDF" with the URL Path "pdf": one that
   the Site Administrator has not enabled, and one that requires
   visitors to sign in ("Users must be registered and log in to view the
   journal site." ticked; "…to view the server site." on a preprint
   server).

   - **The journal not enabled**: the visitor opens the article's
     address: the Login page. The visitor opens the article's address
     followed by "/pdf", the galley's address: the Login page again
     (Actors, opening paragraph; Rule 10b).
   - **Its Reader**: the journal's Reader signs in and opens the
     article's address: the page headed "Tidal Patterns"; "PDF" opens
     the PDF reader page (Actors, opening paragraph; Rule 11).
   - **The journal that requires sign-in**: the visitor opens the same
     two addresses on the second journal: the Login page each time. That
     journal's Reader signs in and opens the article's address: the page
     headed "Tidal Patterns"; "PDF" opens the PDF reader page (Actors,
     opening paragraph).
   - **Control**: on each journal the Reader reads the article at the
     address that sent the visitor to Login (Actors, opening paragraph).
     <sup>s</sup>

6. **"How to Cite": another format, a download and the settings window**

   Given: the Journal Manager, and a visitor, signed out, in a second
   browser, on a scratch journal named "Coastal Review" (a scratch
   preprint server named "Coastal Preprints") with "Citation Style
   Language" on and its "Settings" window never saved, and the article
   "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters" published there, on a journal in
   the published issue "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)".

   - **The citation**: the visitor opens the article's page: the side
     column (at its foot on a journal) shows "How to Cite" over an "APA"
     citation naming "Tidal Patterns in Coastal Waters", "Coastal
     Review" ("In Coastal Preprints" on a preprint server) and the
     article's address (Fields, "How to Cite"; Rule 15).
   - **"More Citation Formats"**: press it: a list opens with "ABNT",
     "ACM", "ACS", "AMA", "APA", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "MLA",
     "Turabian" and "Vancouver", and under them "Download Citation" with
     "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" and "BibTeX". Press "More Citation
     Formats" again: the list closes (Rule 15a).
   - **Another format**: press "More Citation Formats" and choose "IEEE":
     the citation changes in place to another text, the list closes and
     the browser's address stays the same; note the IEEE text. Reload
     the page: the "APA" citation shows again (Rule 15a).
   - **A download**: press "More Citation Formats" and "BibTeX": the
     file "Tidal+Patterns+in+Coastal+Waters.bib" downloads. Press "More
     Citation Formats" and "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)": the file
     "Tidal+Patterns+in+Coastal+Waters.ris" downloads ([A8](#a8))
     (Rule 15b).
   - **No email**: the mail catcher holds no email to the journal's
     accounts from the visitor's steps (Side effects).
   - **The settings window**: the Journal Manager opens Settings ›
     Website › "Plugins" › "Installed Plugins" and presses the "Citation
     Style Language" row's "Settings": "Primary Citation Format" has no
     format chosen, every box under "Additional Citation Formats" is
     ticked, both boxes under "Downloadable Formats" are ticked and
     "Publisher Location" is empty (Fields, the settings window;
     Settings bullet 5).
   - **"Cancel"**: choose "IEEE" under "Primary Citation Format" and press
     "Cancel": the window closes without a question. Press "Settings"
     again: no format is chosen (Fields, "OK / Cancel").
   - **"Close" after a change**: choose "IEEE" and press the window's
     "Close": it asks "The data on this form has changed. Do you wish to
     continue without saving?"; confirm it. Press "Settings" again: no
     format is chosen (Fields, "OK / Cancel").
   - **"OK"**: choose "IEEE", untick every "Additional Citation Formats"
     box but "MLA", untick "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)", type "London,
     U.K." in "Publisher Location" and press "OK": the window closes and
     "Your changes have been saved." shows (Fields, "OK / Cancel"; Side
     effects).
   - **The visitor's page after "OK"**: the visitor reloads the article's
     page: "How to Cite" shows the IEEE citation noted earlier, on a
     journal with "[1]" before it ([OJS11](#ojs11)). "More Citation
     Formats" lists "MLA" alone, and "Download Citation" "BibTeX" alone.
     "London, U.K." shows nowhere, neither in a citation nor in the
     "BibTeX" file: the article was published while the box was empty,
     and the place recorded then stays (Rule 16).
   - **Switching the plugin off**: the Journal Manager unticks the
     "Citation Style Language" row: it asks "Are you sure you want to
     disable this plugin?"; press "OK": "The plugin "Citation Style
     Language" has been disabled." shows and the row offers no
     "Settings". The visitor reloads the article's page: it has no "How
     to Cite" (Settings bullet 4; Fields, the settings window).
   - **Switching it on again**: the Journal Manager ticks the row: "The
     plugin "Citation Style Language" has been enabled." shows. The
     visitor reloads: "How to Cite" shows the IEEE citation again
     (Settings bullet 4).
   - **Control**: "More Citation Formats" still lists "MLA" alone: the
     settings were kept while the plugin was off (Settings bullet 4).
     <sup>s</sup>

7. **The PDF viewer switched off, and the downloads chart**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   with "PDF.JS PDF Viewer" off and "Usage statistics display options"
   set to "Use bar type of the chart for usage statistics display.", and
   a published article "Tidal Patterns" carrying a galley "PDF" (the
   file "article.pdf"; "preprint.pdf" on a preprint server).

   - **"PDF" with the viewer off**: open the article's page and press
     "PDF": "article.pdf" ("preprint.pdf") downloads, and the browser
     stays on the article's page (Settings bullet 1; Rule 11).
   - **The "Downloads" chart**: the main column carries a section headed
     "Downloads" with an empty chart, since the test install never
     counts the downloads ([A3](#a3)) (Rule 17; Side effects).
   - **Control**: the seeded journal, at the install default "Do not
     display submission usage statistics chart for reader.", shows no
     "Downloads" section on scenario 1's article pages (Settings
     bullet 6). <sup>s</sup>

8. **The page in French**

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal (preprint server)
   with French (Canada) among its interface and submission languages,
   and a published article titled "Tidal Patterns" in English and
   "Motifs des marées" in French, with an abstract in each language,
   the keyword "tide" in English and "marée" in French, and two
   galleys: "PDF" in English and "HTML" in French (Canada).

   - **The English page**: open {journal address}/en/article/view/{number}
     ("preprint/view/" on a preprint server): the page is headed "Tidal
     Patterns", its keywords read "Keywords: tide", and the galley links
     read "PDF" and "HTML (French (Canada))" (Rules 10a, 21).
   - **The French page**: open {journal
     address}/fr_CA/article/view/{number}: the page is headed "Motifs des
     marées", with the French abstract under its heading; on a journal
     the keywords read "Mots-clés : marée" ([OPS7](#ops7)); the galley
     links read "PDF (anglais)" and "HTML" (Rules 10a, 21).
   - **The French PDF reader** {OJS}: press "PDF (anglais)": the
     browser tab reads "Vue de Motifs des marées" ([OPS8](#ops8))
     (Fields, the PDF reader page).
   - **Control**: open {journal address}/en/article/view/{number} again:
     the page is headed "Tidal Patterns", and its galley links read "PDF"
     and "HTML (French (Canada))" once more (Rule 21). <sup>s</sup>

9. **The article summary on a journal's lists** {OJS}

   Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch journal whose home page
   shows the current issue ("Include the current issue's table of
   contents" ticked under the theme's "Journal Content Organization"),
   with the category "Oceans" and the published
   issue "Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)", which has a cover image; two articles are
   published in that issue: "Tidal Patterns", with the subtitle "A field
   study", a cover image of its own, the category "Oceans" and the
   galleys "PDF" (of the component "Article Text") and "Data" (of the
   component "Data Set"), and "Harbour Currents", with no cover image of
   its own.

   - **The issue's cover on an article's page**: open "Harbour
     Currents": the side column shows the issue's cover image as a link;
     press it: the issue's page opens (Fields, the side column, "Cover
     image").
   - **The issue's table of contents**: on the issue's page, "Tidal
     Patterns" is listed with its own cover image, the title "Tidal
     Patterns" with "A field study", the author line and the galley link
     "PDF", with no "Data". Press the title: the article's page opens. Go
     back and press the middle of the cover image: the article's page
     opens again (Fields, the article summary; Rule 22).
   - **"Current Issue"**: press "Home" in the breadcrumb: on the home
     page "Tidal Patterns" is listed under "Current Issue" with "PDF" and
     no "Data" (Rule 22).
   - **A category page**: on the article's page press "Oceans" under
     "Categories": the category's page lists "Tidal Patterns" with its
     title and cover image and no galley link (Rule 22).
   - **Control**: the article's own page lists "PDF" and, in a second
     list below it, "Data" (Rule 10). <sup>s</sup>

10. **The preprint summary on a preprint server's lists** {OPS}

    Given: a visitor, signed out, on a scratch preprint server with the
    category "Oceans", and a preprint posted once today ({today} below),
    "Tidal Patterns", with the subtitle "A field study", a cover image,
    the keywords "tide" and "current", the category "Oceans" and a
    galley "PDF".

    - **"Latest preprints"**: open the server's home page: "Tidal
      Patterns" is listed under "Latest preprints" with its cover image,
      the title with "A field study", the author line, the keywords
      "tide" and "current" in either order ([A11](#a11)), the line "Downloads: 0 - Submitted {today} -
      Posted {today}" and the galley link "PDF" ([OPS6](#ops6)). Press
      the title: the preprint's page opens (Fields, the article summary;
      Rule 22; Side effects).
    - **"Archives"**: press "Archives" in the main menu: the "Archives"
      page lists the same summary (Fields, the article summary).
    - **A category page**: on the preprint's page press "Oceans" under
      "Categories": the category's page lists "Tidal Patterns" with no
      galley link (Rule 22).
    - **Control**: the details line ends at "Posted {today}", with no " -
      Versions:" part, the preprint having one version posted (Fields,
      the article summary). <sup>s</sup>

**A1 — In French, readers and editors see a raw translation key in place of every version's name and number** · 🐞 · low.
On an article, book or preprint page shown in French, the "Versions"
list names every version with a raw translation key,
"##publication.versionStage.display##": two versions posted the same day
read "2026-09-30 (##publication.versionStage.display##)" twice. The
English page reads "2026-09-30 (Author Original 2.0)" and "2026-09-30
(Author Original 1.0)". A preprint's line above its title shows the same
key, and so does the editor's workflow: its "Publication" menu lists
one entry per version, and the "Create New Version" window's list of
versions to copy from offers each under the same key.
Nothing is lost and every link still opens its version, but neither a
reader nor an editor can tell the versions apart by name or number in
French. The release before listed them by number in French ("2026-09-30
(2)").
French (Canada) was walked. By the code, every language but English
shows the key, except a language with no text for the whole entry:
there, as walked in Japanese and Spanish (Mexico), the entry reads
"##submission.versionIdentity##" instead. The text behind
the key is only the pattern "stage major.minor", which holds no word.
New texts are offered to translators once the release branch opens, so
this one would reach them before the release, and each language shows
the key until its translators copy the pattern. The proposed fix builds
the name in code instead, so the numbers show at once in every language
that has the entry's text. After it a French reader sees
"2026-09-30 (##publication.versionStage.authorOriginal## 2.0)": the
stage name stays a raw key until it is translated.

**A2 — An older version's PDF opens a reader with no document, and its "Download" gets no file** · 🐞 · high · crash: script.
An older version's page lists that version's galleys. Its PDF link
opens the PDF reader page with the outdated-version notice, but the
viewer shows no document: an empty page reading "0 of 0", with no
message. The reader page's "Download" gets no file either, and the
browser stays on the reader page.
A reader who wants the version they cite cannot read or download its
PDF, and the page offers no other link to it. The older version's
other galleys (HTML, other files) still open. An editor who previews a
new, unpublished version gets the same empty viewer for its PDF.
It happens on every article or preprint with more than one version
while the "PDF.JS PDF Viewer" plugin is on, as it is by default. A
press's books are not affected: their PDF reader asks for the file of
the version shown.
When the galley's URL Path is the same in both versions, the older
version's PDF reader page shows the current version's file under the
outdated notice; the two are the same file only until an editor
replaces the current galley's file ([→ Galleys, A4](U46-galleys.md#a4)).

**A3 — No sentence for an article without downloads** · ❓ · minor.
With a chart chosen, an article nobody has downloaded yet shows the
"Downloads" heading over an empty chart. The page carries the sentence
"Download data is not yet available." for that case, but it never
appears.
Question: should an article with no downloads show the sentence instead
of an empty chart? Lean: yes; the sentence exists for exactly this case.

**A4 — Preprint lists and a journal's "Latest Publications" show additional files and link a galley with no file ("404 Not Found")** · 🐞 · low.
An article's or preprint's own page offers its main galleys, sets its
additional files (a data set, a research instrument) apart under
"Additional Files", and leaves out a galley that has no file. An
issue's table of contents offers the main galleys only. A preprint
server's lists, and a journal's "Latest Publications" when the home
page does not also show the current issue's table of contents, offer
every galley instead: the additional files as if they were the article
itself, and the galley with no file as a link that answers "404 Not
Found".
A galley has no file when an editor presses "Add galley", saves the
label and then cancels the upload window. A galley at a separate
website is not this case: it has an address, and its link works.
Both symptoms come from one missing filter, and one fix covers both.
Every file stays reachable from the item's own page. On a journal the
list in question, "Latest Publications", exists on `main` only. A
journal with no issue shows it that way with no setting touched; a
journal with issues does once a manager turns it on and takes the
current issue's table of contents off the home page.

**A5 — An author previewing their unpublished article, book or preprint gets "access denied" from "View submission"** · 🐞 · low.
An author who opens the page of their own article, book or preprint
before it is published sees it under "This is a preview and has not
been published. View submission". Pressing "View submission" opens a
page reading "The current role does not have access to this
operation." instead of their submission.
The author reaches the submission from "My Submissions" instead.
Editors and managers pressing the same link land on the submission's
workflow.

**A6 — An older version's browser tab names the current version** · 🐞 · low.
An older version's page is headed with that version's title, but the
browser tab, and a bookmark made from it, reads the current version's
title. On a journal, the page that shows an older version's HTML galley
has the same fault. A reader who bookmarks the version they cite gets a
bookmark named after another version. The fault shows only when a later
version was published under a different title.

**A7 — "ABNT" citation runs a preprint's title into the server's name and prints the date as "30 Sept.2026"** · 🐞 · low.
In the "ABNT" format under "How to Cite", a preprint's title and the
preprint server's name are printed with no space or full stop between
them, and on a journal and a preprint server alike the date runs the
month into the year ("30 Sept.2026"). A reader who copies the citation
has to repair it by hand. The citation was punctuated correctly until
the plugin's "ABNT" style file was replaced in May 2026.
On a preprint server whose plugin settings have "Publisher Location"
filled in, the citation also runs the server's name into the place
("Public Knowledge Preprint ServerLondon, U.K."). A journal's citation
does not print the place and is not affected by this part.
It needs the "Citation Style Language" plugin, which is off on a new
journal or server until a manager turns it on, and a reader who picks
"ABNT" under "More Citation Formats", or "ABNT" set as the primary
format. The other ten formats, the two citation downloads and a press's
"ABNT" citation of a book are not affected.

**A8 — "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" citation download writes its dates with "%" signs ("PY  - %2026/%09/%30")** · 🐞 · low.
On a journal, a preprint server and a press, the
"Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" file a reader downloads from the "How to
Cite" block writes its dates with a "%" before the year, the month and
the day. An article's and a preprint's file reads
"PY  - %2026/%09/%30" and "Y2  - %2026/%10/%01", and a book's
"PY  - %2026". The reader expects "2026/09/30" and "2026".
The file's publication date and access date are therefore not in the
form the RIS format asks for. The "BibTeX" download of the same page
carries the year correctly.
It needs the "Citation Style Language" plugin turned on. Every RIS
download is affected, whatever the item.

Under "References" on an article's, preprint's or book's page, a web
address followed directly by ")" becomes a link whose address and text
end in ")". A reference that gives its DOI address in parentheses,
"(https://doi.org/10.1234/u13ir23).", is the usual case: its link leads
to "https://doi.org/10.1234/u13ir23)", which does not exist.
The reader expects the link to stop before the ")", as it does before a
"." or "," after an address.
It shows wherever a reference closes a parenthesis right after an
address, also when the ")" is followed by ".", "," or ";". A ";" or

Keywords typed "tide" then "current" can show on the article's, book's
or preprint's page as "Keywords: current, tide", and in a preprint
server's lists as "current" then "tide". The editor expects the order
they typed.
The app saves the order and never reads it back, so the page shows the
keywords in whatever order the database returns them. Once they show in
another order, the next save of the publication stores that order, and
the typed order is kept nowhere. Nothing tells the editor.
On a freshly installed site the typed order holds; it turns only after
the database has stored the rows of one list out of order, which an
editor cannot see coming. Subjects, disciplines and supporting agencies
are stored and read the same way.

unpublished version's date: "Published 2024-03-01 — Updated on

address answers the "404 Not Found" page. A reader is given a first
publication date for a version they cannot find. The line takes its
first date from every version, published or not, which is also why a
draft rewrites it

an outdated version published on . Read the most recent version." That
notice is meant for an older, superseded version, but this version is

On a journal, some staff can read a submission they are not assigned

Subscription Manager and the assistant roles (Copyeditor, Layout
Editor, Proofreader and the like). They type the page's address,
`article/view/<n>` with the submission's ID, and see its title,
abstract, authors and affiliations. This works while the submission is
still in the Submission or Review stage, and after it was declined.
On a press, a Series editor and the assistant roles do the same on the
book landing page, `catalog/book/<n>`. Their dashboard does not list
the submission and its workflow refuses them. The page should answer
"404 Not Found" to them until the submission reaches copyediting.
A staff member who also reviews the submission double-anonymously sees
on that page the authors' names the review screens hide. On a journal,
once an editor ticks "Make available with publication" on the
version's "JATS XML", the page's "JATS XML" link downloads the XML,
author names included, for the same staff. Nothing can be changed
through the page.
The change behind it (`pkp/pkp-lib#12245`, the workflow for versions
published while still under review) lets submissions be previewed
before copyediting. The proposed fix keeps that for managers and for
everyone assigned to the submission. It closes the page before
copyediting only to staff who are not assigned.

A journal manager who opens the "Publication Facts Label plugin"

Plugin Gallery. That plugin is gone: funders are now part of the
journal's own metadata (the "Funders" setting), and the plugin's
"Publication Facts" panel on article pages takes its "External funding"
row from that setting.
The settings still save, but the manager is sent looking for a plugin
that cannot be installed, and the warning never goes away. The warning
also ignores the "Funders" setting. A journal that turns funder metadata
off, which leaves the panel with no funding data, sees the same warning
and is not told to turn the setting back on.
Only journals on the coming release meet it, once they turn the plugin
on (it is off by default). On 3.5 the panel still uses the Funding

link named another version, so a reader following a citation or a
bookmark of version 1.0 reads the latest version without being told.

Path given to the older version's galley after the address was handed

under the title to just under the "Downloads" line; on a square cover
that is about the middle half. Above and below the band the cover opens
the preprint.
A journal's issue page and its other article lists do the same in the
row of the author line, about an eighth of a square cover's height.
The title and the rest of the cover still open the page, so readers get
there with a second click.

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

Code read 2026-09-24 at the checkouts' tips (`checkouts/ojs`,
`checkouts/ops`, each with its `lib/pkp`; `checkouts/omp` for the
counterpart only). The two apps' landing pages are app-side copies
(RUNBOOK multi-app rule 7), so every shared claim here needed a probe on
both. Every claim was then driven between 2026-09-24 and 2026-09-25 on
scratch journals and preprint servers, signed out and as the roles each
note names, with a scratch press as the read-only control for the claims
a press does not share; notes q1 to q16 held the author's open questions
before the drive and now record what the screens showed.

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — The page: OJS `templates/frontend/pages/article.tpl` with
`templates/frontend/objects/article_details.tpl`, served by
`pages/article/ArticleHandler.php`; OPS `templates/frontend/pages/preprint.tpl`
with `templates/frontend/objects/preprint_details.tpl`, served by
`pages/preprint/PreprintHandler.php`. No lib/pkp class is shared between
the two handlers. The blocks other features describe are rendered by the
same templates (contributors, statements, funders, pubIds, license) or
added by plugins through `Templates::Article::Details` (Crossref's
Crossmark button, `CrossrefPlugin::displayCrossmarkButton()`). OPS's
relation notice: `preprint_details.tpl`, `relationStatus ==
PUBLICATION_RELATION_PUBLISHED`, texts `publication.relation.published`
"This preprint has been published elsewhere." and
`publication.relation.vorDoi` "DOI of the published preprint";
left to *Preprint relations*. OMP's book page is
`pages/catalog/CatalogBookHandler`
with `monograph_full.tpl`, the counterpart feature.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Purpose), OJS and OPS: a published article's
page was reached from an issue's table of contents, the home page, a
category page, search results and its typed address; its PDF opened the
reader page and a text galley downloaded; the preprint page read
"Posted". The comments blocks showed on a journal only (none on a
preprint page with public comments on). After "Make available with
publication" on the JATS XML page, "JATS XML" sat in the journal's side
column between the main galleys and the additional files; a preprint
server has no JATS XML page. With Crossref chosen and its "Enable
participation in Crossmark…" ticked on Distribution › DOIs ›
"Registration", the Crossmark button showed last in the journal's side
column, after "URN"; a preprint server's Crossref "Registration" tab has
no Crossmark box. The relation notice read "This preprint has been
published elsewhere. DOI of the published preprint
https://doi.org/10.1234/elsewhere" above the label line. OMP control: a
published book has no article page (its number under `article/view/`
answered "404 Not Found"); its page is `catalog/book/{id}`.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — Access: `ArticleHandler::initialize()` answers
`NotFoundHttpException` when no submission matches, and when the requested
publication is not `STATUS_PUBLISHED` and the user is absent or fails
`Repo::submission()->canPreview()`; `ArticleHandler::authorize()` adds
`OjsJournalMustPublishPolicy` ("This journal does not publish its content
online." under publishing mode none) and galley access runs through
`ArticleHandler::userCanViewGalley()` (subscriptions, purchases, the
journal's article-access restriction: *Subscriptions & open access
control*). OPS: `PreprintHandler::initialize()`, `OpsServerMustPublishPolicy`,
`PreprintHandler::userCanViewGalley()` (published, or `canPreview()`). The
page's only per-user content is the comments component
(`UserCommentComponent`, `enablePublicComments`). `view()` and
`download()` send no mail; they fire `UsageEvent` only. The closed
journal: `manager.setup.restrictSiteAccess` "Users must be registered
and log in to view the journal site." (OPS "…to view the server site.")
and the context's enabled flag.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Actors preamble, rows 2–6; Side effects), OJS
and OPS: with "Users must be registered…" ticked, a signed-out visitor
typing a published article's address or its galley's address landed on
Login, and the journal's Reader read the page; with the journal
un-enabled by the Site Administrator ("Enable this journal to appear
publicly on the site"), the visitor landed on Login and the Reader still
read the article. The Journal Manager, the Site Administrator and the
assigned Section Editor (Moderator) opened an unpublished article's
preview, their workflow offering "Preview"; the submission's Author
opened it by typing the address, the Author's workflow offering none; a
visitor, the Reader and a Reviewer (OJS) got "404 Not Found". Signed out
and as the Reader, "PDF" opened the reader and its "Download" saved the
file; "More Citation Formats" › "MLA" replaced the citation and
"BibTeX" downloaded. The Journal Manager reached Settings › Website ›
"Plugins"; the Section Editor (Moderator), the Author and the Reader got
the access-denied page there. Reading the page, a format, a citation
download, the PDF reader and its "Download" left the mail catcher's
counts for the manager, the author, the section editor and the Reader,
and the manager's and the author's "Tasks" counts, unchanged.

<a id="fn-q1"></a>
**q1** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Actors preamble, row 1), OJS and OPS:
a published article with a PDF galley, its current and its older
version, read signed out and as Reader, Author, Reviewer (OJS),
Assistant, Section Editor (Moderator), Journal Manager and Site
Administrator: headings, links and notices were identical at every
level. With public comments on, the journal's page differed only in the
comments blocks ("Log in to comment" signed out; "What do you think
about this publication? Type your comments here." and "Submit" signed
in); a preprint server's page, and a press's book page (the control),
differed in nothing.

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — Parts of the page, `article_details.tpl` / `preprint_details.tpl`
in template order. Breadcrumb `frontend/components/breadcrumbs_article.tpl`
(`common.homepageNavigationLabel` "Home", `navigation.archives`
"Archives", the issue's `getIssueIdentification()`, the section title)
and `breadcrumbs_preprint.tpl` ("Home", the section title);
`navigation.breadcrumbSeparator` "/". DOI: `doi.readerDisplayName` "DOI"
through `semicolon` "{$label}: ", link `doiObject->getData('resolvingUrl')`;
the object is the publication's own, else a minor version's under DOI
versioning, else the current version's (`ArticleHandler::view()`,
`PreprintHandler::view()`). Keywords: OJS `article.subject`, OPS
`preprint.subject`, both "Keywords", `getLocalizedData('keywords')`
joined by `common.commaListSeparator`; OPS's `locale/fr_CA/locale.po`
holds `preprint.subject` with an empty translation (OPS7). Abstract: OJS
`article.abstract`, OPS `common.abstract`, both "Abstract".
`submission.plainLanguageSummary` "Plain Language Summary". Cover:
`publication.coverImage`, else (OJS only) the issue's cover linked to
`issue/view/{bestIssueId}`. Issue block (OJS): `issue.issue` "Issue",
`section.section` "Section", `category.category` "Categories" (lib/pkp),
`submission.articleNumber` "Article Number". Categories: OJS
`Repo::category()->getCollector()->filterByPublicationIds()`, each
`getLocalizedTitle()`, linked to `catalog/category/{path}`; OPS builds
"{parent} > {title}" in `PreprintHandler::view()`, linked to
`preprints/category/{path}` under `category.categories` "Categories" (app
key). Every part is wrapped in an `{if}` on its data; OPS's "References"
condition held for every preprint until ops `dafd9b3263`, merged
2026-10-09 (note m). Localized texts come from
`getLocalizedData()`, which reads the visitor's locale first.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the landing page; Rules 6, 14, 21), OJS
and OPS: the breadcrumb read "Home / Archives / Vol. 1 No. 2 (2014) /
Articles" ("Home / Archives / Articles" with no issue), the section
plain and the rest links, and "Home / Preprints" with "Home" the only
link on the preprint server; the title with "Full subtitle" under it,
the browser tab reading "{title}: {subtitle} | {journal}"; once a DOI
prefix was set on screen, "DOI: https://doi.org/10.1234/…" as a link;
"Keywords: alpha, beta" as plain text; the abstract, the plain language
summary and "References" with their headings. An article with a title,
one contributor and an abstract showed the title, "Abstract",
"Published", "Versions" and on a journal "Section" (plus "Issue" and the
issue's cover in an issue with one); on a preprint server the title,
"Abstract", "References", "Posted" and "Versions". An older version's
page showed "Keywords: vone" and "Arts" where the current one showed
"Keywords: vtwo", "Arts" and "Science". On a journal's French page every
label was French ("Accueil", "Mots-clés :", "Résumé", "Publié",
"Versions", "Numéro", "Rubrique", "Catégories", and "Téléchargements"
for screen readers), the article's French title, abstract, keyword and
category names shown, English where the version had no French; the
preprint page's keywords label read "##preprint.subject## :".
Walked 2026-10-09 (Rule 6; scenario 1), OPS at `dafd9b3263`: a preprint
with no references showed no "References" heading, where the 2026-09-25
probe above read one (note m has the walk).

<a id="fn-q6"></a>
**q6** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the side column; Rule 6), OJS
and OPS: a minimal article and one filled as far as the Publication
pages allow, both published. The journal's side column ran: its own
cover image (not a link), "PDF", "Data", "Published", "Versions", "Data
Availability Statement", "Funding Statement", "Issue" ("Vol. 1 No. 2
(2014)", a link), "Section" (plain), "Categories", "Article Number"
("e42", plain), "Funders", "Comments", "URN", "License", "How to Cite";
the preprint server's: cover, "PDF", "Data", "Posted", "Versions",
"Categories", "How to Cite", "Data Availability Statement", "Funding
Statement", "Funders", "License". "Categories" read "Physics" and
"Science" on the journal, "Science > Physics" and "Science" on the
server, each a link that landed on the category page. An article with no
cover of its own, in an issue with a cover, showed the issue's cover as
a link to the issue's page. With "Publication Facts Label plugin" and
"Citation Style Language" both on, "How to Cite" was last and no
Publication Facts panel appeared (OJS5).

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — PDF reader: `plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer/PdfJsViewerPlugin.php`
(the OJS and OPS files are identical, diffed), `submissionCallback()` on
`ArticleHandler::view::galley` and `PreprintHandler::view::galley` for a
galley whose file type is `application/pdf`; `templates/display.tpl`
(identical): return link to `parentUrl` (the article's unversioned view)
with screen-reader text `issue.return` "Return to Issue Details" whenever
the page has an issue, else `article.return` "Return to Article Details"
(both OJS app keys; OPS has neither, OPS5; OJS6), title link,
`common.download` "Download" with `common.downloadPdf` "Download PDF"
for screen readers, the pdf.js viewer in an iframe titled
`submission.representationOfTitle` "{$representation} of {$title}"; the
outdated notice `submission.outdatedVersion` when `!isLatestPublication`;
browser title `article.pageTitle` "View of {$title}", which OPS's French
locale lacks (OPS8).
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the PDF reader page; Rules 11, 12), OJS
and OPS: the viewer offered "Toggle Sidebar", "Find in Document",
"Previous Page", "Next Page", "Page", "Zoom Out", "Zoom In", "Zoom",
"Highlight", "Text", "Draw", "Add or edit images", "Print", "Save" and
"Tools"; "Download" saved `article.pdf` / `preprint.pdf`, the browser
staying on the reader, and a screen reader read it "Download PDF"
("Télécharger le PDF" in French). The arrow's hidden text read "Return
to Issue Details" on a journal article in an issue (French "Retourner
aux renseignements sur le numéro"), "Return to Article Details" on one
in no issue, "##article.return##" on the preprint server, and pressing it
opened the article's unversioned page (two runs on the journal). The
browser tab read "View of {title}" in English on both, "Vue de {title}"
on the journal's French page and "##article.pageTitle##" on the
server's. The page has no heading; the title is a link in the bar.

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — Galley lists: `ArticleHandler::view()` / `PreprintHandler::view()`
skip a galley with neither `urlRemote` nor a file, put remote galleys and
files of `GenreDAO::getPrimaryByContextId()` (enabled, not dependent, not
supplementary) in `primaryGalleys`, files of
`GenreDAO::getBySupplementaryAndContextId(true)` in `supplementaryGalleys`,
and drop the rest; screen-reader headings `submission.downloads`
"Downloads" and `submission.additionalFiles` "Additional Files". Default
components and their flags: `registry/genres.xml` (both apps). Link text
`Galley::getGalleyLabel()`, which appends " ({language name})" when the
galley's locale is not the UI locale. Link addresses:
`frontend/objects/galley_link.tpl` (app copies): OJS `publication.urlPath`
or the article number, then `getBestGalleyId()`, and
`{bestId}/version/{publicationId}/{galley}` for a publication other than
the current one; OPS the same through `getBestId()`. HTML reader (OJS
only): `plugins/generic/htmlArticleGalley/HtmlArticleGalleyPlugin.php`
for `text/html`, `templates/display.tpl` (return link `article.return`,
title from `$article->getCurrentPublication()`, iframe on the `download`
op with `inline=true`, versioned for an older publication, notice dated
with `dateFormatLong`); `articleDownloadCallback()` serves the HTML
(cached a day for signed-out readers). Lens (OJS only):
`plugins/generic/lensGalley/LensGalleyPlugin.php` for `application/xml`
and `text/xml`, `templates/articleGalley.tpl` inside the journal's
`frontend/components/header.tpl`; its `display.tpl` loads MathJax 3 from
a public CDN (OJS9). Anything else: no plugin claims the hook, `view()`
redirects to the `download` op and `PKPFileService::download()` sends
the file with `Content-Disposition: attachment`. Remote:
`redirectUrl(urlRemote)` in `view()` and `download()`.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 10, 10a, 10b; Settings bullet 11), OJS and
OPS: on an English page the lists read "PDF", "HTML (French (Canada))",
"Remote", then "Data", "Notes"; on a French page "PDF (anglais)", "Data
(anglais)", "Remote (anglais)" and plain "HTML" for the French galley.
Addresses: `…/view/{number}/{galley number}`, `…/view/{number}/pdf` for
a galley URL Path, `…/view/probe-path/{galley number}` for an article
URL Path, `…/view/{number}/version/{id}/{galley}` on an older version's
page. On a new journal and server Settings › Workflow › Submission ›
"Components" ("Article Components", "Preprint Components") showed the
supplementary box ticked for the nine components listed, and "These are
dependent files…" ticked for "Multimedia", "Image" and "HTML
Stylesheet"; the galley upload offered none of the three. The window's
"Close" after a change asked "The data on this form has changed. Do you
wish to continue without saving?"; "Save" closed it with no notice.

<a id="fn-q7"></a>
**q7** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 10, 22; A4), OJS and OPS: an
article with "PDF" of "Article Text" ("Preprint Text"), "Data" of "Data
Set", "Notes" of "Other", a French "HTML", a remote galley, and "Draft"
added on the "Galleys" page with its upload closed before a file was
chosen (its row read "Draft English"); an "Image" galley could not be
made (above). Signed out and as the Reader, the page listed "PDF",
"HTML (French (Canada))" and "Remote", then "Data" and "Notes", in the
"Galleys" page's order; "Draft" nowhere; screen-reader headings
"Downloads" and "Additional Files" ("Téléchargements", "Fichiers
supplémentaires"). With "Data Set" no longer supplementary, "Data" moved
to the main list; made dependent, it left the page. Listings: on the
journal the issue's table of contents, the home page's "Current Issue"
and, beside it, "Latest Publications" showed the main galleys only; with
"Include the current issue's table of contents" unticked, "Latest
Publications" showed "PDF", "Data", "Remote" and "Draft", and "Draft"
answered "404 Not Found"; ticked again, the main galleys only. The
server's "Latest preprints" and "Archives" showed every galley, "Draft"
included, answering "404 Not Found".

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — Addresses: `ArticleHandler::initialize()`: a digit-only path is
looked up by number, anything else by `Repo::submission()->getByUrlPath()`;
when `getBestId()` differs from the requested path it redirects to
`[$currentUrlPath, ...$args]`; a `version` sub-path picks the publication
by its id, and an unknown id leaves the typed `Publication $publication`
property unassigned, which fails (the versions spec's OJS3); the galley
is matched by `getBestGalleyId()`, a digit-only galley path matching a
galley's number redirects to its best id, a galley found only in another
published publication redirects to the article's view, and anything else
is `NotFoundHttpException`. That galley redirect builds
`[$submission->getBestId(), $galley->getBestGalleyId()]`, so it drops a
`version/{id}` part and a trailing file id, and `getBestGalleyId()`
then names the current version's galley of that URL Path (OJS14). OPS `PreprintHandler::initialize()`: the
redirect builds `$newArgs = $args; $newArgs[0] = $currentUrlPath;` after
the path was shifted off `$args` (OPS2); no digit-only galley redirect
(OPS3); `$publication` is untyped, so an unknown version is a plain
`NotFoundHttpException`. Notices: `submission.viewingPreview` "This is a
preview and has not been published. <a href="{$url}">View
submission</a>" with `url` → `dashboard/editorial?workflowSubmissionId={id}`
(A5); `submission.outdatedVersion` "This is an outdated version
published on {$datePublished}. Read the <a
href="{$urlRecentVersion}">most recent version</a>." OJS chains the two
with `{elseif}`; OPS tests them separately (OPS1). An older
publication's page also gets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
and a canonical link to the current version. Live-probed 2026-09-25
(Rules 1–5, 13): notes q2, q3, q4 and q10 record what the addresses
opened.

<a id="fn-q2"></a>
**q2** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 1, 2; OPS2), OJS and OPS: an
article with an older published version, "URL Path" typed "probe-path"
on the new version's "Publication Settings" ("Preprint entry") page and
saved, then published. Signed out: the number address forwarded to
`…/view/probe-path`; the number followed by a galley's number opened
`…/view/probe-path/{galley}`'s PDF reader on the journal and the
preprint's page on the server; followed by `/version/{older id}` it
opened `…/view/probe-path/version/{id}` with the outdated notice on the
journal, and "404 Not Found" at `…/view/probe-path/{id}` on the server.
The versions' own addresses carried the ids of the "Versions" links
(`…/article/view/60/version/68` for "Version of Record 1.0", `…/preprint/view/43/version/45`
for "Author Original 1.0"); the current version's own such address
opened the plain page with no notice. `/version/999999`, and another
article's version id, answered a blank server error page on the journal
and "404 Not Found" on the server. The field reads "URL Path" on both,
its help "Set a custom URL for this publication, or leave blank to use
the default." (OJS) and "An optional path to use in the URL instead of
the ID." (OPS). Live-probed 2026-10-05 (Rule 1; OPS2), OJS and OPS, two
runs on scratch contexts, signed out, an article with two versions and
the URL Path "i05c" on both: on the journal the number address
forwarded to `…/view/i05c`, `…/{n}/version/{v1}` to
`…/i05c/version/{v1}` (the older page), `…/{n}/{print galley}` to
`…/i05c/{print galley}` and `…/{n}/version/{v1}/pdf` to
`…/i05c/version/{v1}/pdf`, the older PDF reader under the outdated
notice; on the server `…/{n}/version/{v1}` went to `…/i05c/{v1}`, "404
Not Found", and `…/{n}/{print galley}` to the preprint's page. The
version's "Publication Settings" ("Preprint entry") page showed "URL
Path" holding "i05c" on both versions.

<a id="fn-q3"></a>
**q3** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 3, 4; A5; OPS1), OJS and OPS:
signed out, as the Reader and as a Reviewer (OJS), an unpublished
article's address, a scheduled one's (OJS), a draft third version's own
address (the one its "Preview" opened for the Journal Manager), an
unknown number, an unknown URL Path and another journal's article
number each answered "404 Not Found" (OMP control: an
unpublished book's address alike). The Journal Manager's "Preview"
opened the page under "This is a preview and has not been published.
View submission", with no "Published" line and no "Versions" list;
"View submission" opened the submission's workflow on its current
stage. The Author, typing the address, got the same preview; the
Author's "View submission" landed on "The current role does not have
access to this operation.". On the server, a new version previewed after
"Create New Version" on a posted preprint showed that notice and under it
"This is an outdated version published on 2026-09-25. Read the most
recent version.", the day of the preview, and the label line "Preprint /
2026-09-25 (Author Original 1.2)"; the journal showed the preview notice
alone. A scheduled article seeded as published sits at the Submission
stage, whose workflow offers no "Preview"; the manager still opened its
preview by the address.

<a id="fn-q4"></a>
**q4** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 5; A6), OJS and OPS: an article
with a first version backdated to 2026-09-01 and a second one published.
Signed out, the older version's page (from "Versions") read "This is an
outdated version published on 2026-09-01. Read the most recent
version.", and "most recent version" opened the article's address. The
older page was headed with its own title while the browser tab read the
current version's title and the journal's name (two runs on the
journal).

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — Dates and versions: `firstPublication` is the publication with the
earliest `datePublished` among all of the submission's publications
(`ArticleHandler::view()`, `PreprintHandler::view()`); `submissions.published`
"Published" (OJS app) / "Posted" (OPS app); `submission.updatedOn`
"{$datePublished} — Updated on {$dateUpdated}"; `submission.versions`
"Versions"; entries `submission.versionIdentity` "{$datePublished}
({$version})" over `array_reverse(getPublishedPublications())`, the shown
one unlinked, the current one to the plain address, others to
`version/{id}`. The version name is `Repo::publication()->getVersionString()`
→ `PublicationVersionInfo::__toString()` → `publication.versionStage.display`
"{$stage} {$majorNumbering}.{$minorNumbering}", which `lib/pkp/locale/fr_CA`
lacks (A1). OPS label line: `common.publication` "Preprint",
`navigation.breadcrumbSeparator`, the same `submission.versionIdentity`.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 7–9), OJS and OPS: one version read
"Published 2026-09-01"; two read "Published 2026-09-01 — Updated on
2026-09-24" ("Posted 2026-09-01 — Updated on 2026-09-25" on the server).
"Versions" listed "2026-09-24 (Version of Record 1.1)" then "2026-09-01
(Version of Record 1.0)" ("Author Original …" on the server), the shown
one plain, the current one linked to the plain address and the older to
its own; a draft third version created 2026-09-25 was not listed, but
the current page's line then read "Published 2026-09-25 — Updated on
2026-09-24" and the older one's "Published 2026-09-25 — Updated on
2026-09-01" ("Posted 2026-09-25 — Updated on 2026-09-25" and "Posted
2026-09-25 — Updated on 2026-09-01" on the server; the versions spec's
A6). The label line read
"Preprint / 2026-09-25 (Author Original 1.1)" on the current page and
"Preprint / 2026-09-01 (Author Original 1.0)" on the older one.
Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rules 3, 7, 7b, 8; A12), OJS and OPS, two runs
on scratch contexts, signed out: a first version seeded published on
2024-03-01 (OJS, in an issue) or 2024-03-03 (OJS and OPS), then a
second created and published on 2026-09-28 (on OJS once with "Don't
Assign To An Issue", once keeping the issue). Before, one version read
"Published 2024-03-01" ("Posted 2024-03-03"); with both published the
line read "Published 2024-03-01 — Updated on 2026-09-28" and "Versions"
listed "2026-09-28 (Version of Record 1.1)" and "2024-03-01 (Version of
Record 1.0)" ("Author Original …" on the server), the first version's
own address answering 200 under the older-version notice. The first
version was then unpublished, on OJS by the issue's "Table of Contents"
› "Remove" (answered `status:true`) and by its own "Unpublish", on OPS
by "Unpost" (200 each; the version's controls then read "Preview",
"Publish" ("Post")). The unpublished publication kept its
`datePublished` (the versions spec's Rule 9) and `firstPublication`
still picked it: the line read "Published 2024-03-01 — Updated on
2026-09-28" ("…2024-03-03…" for the article first published that day,
OPS "Posted 2024-03-03 — Updated on 2026-09-28") at once and after a reload, "Versions" listed only
"2026-09-28 (Version of Record 1.1)" ("Author Original 1.1"), and
`article/view/{id}/version/{v1}` (`preprint/view/{id}/version/{v1}`)
answered 404. No request failed.

**q5** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 8, 9, 21; A1; OPS7), OJS and OPS,
French opened through the language's own address: the "Versions" list
read "2026-09-24 (##publication.versionStage.display##)", the label line
"Prépublication / 2026-09-25 (##publication.versionStage.display##)"
(a press's book page the same key, the control). The labels turned
French on the journal and the article's French title, abstract and
keyword showed where the version had them; the preprint's keywords
label read "##preprint.subject## : francais". The role under each
contributor's name read "Author" on both apps' French pages; the role's
French name on the scratch journals was not checked, and the list is
*Contributors & affiliations*'. Live-probed 2026-10-05 (Rules 8, 9, 21;
A1; A15), OJS and OPS, two runs on scratch contexts with an article of
two versions, and a press's book page as the control, Japanese and
Spanish (Mexico) installed by the Site Administrator under
Administration › Site Settings › "Languages" › "Install Locale" (listed
with "*" beside French (Canada)) and removed afterwards: English read
"2026-10-05 (Version of Record 1.1)" plain and "2026-10-05 (Version of
Record 1.0)" linked ("Author Original …" on the server); French
(Canada) read "2026-10-05 (##publication.versionStage.display##)" on
all three, the server's label line "Prépublication / 2026-10-05
(##publication.versionStage.display##)", the older notice "Ceci est une
version obsolète publiée le 2026-10-05. Consulter la version la plus
récente." and no other raw key. Japanese and Spanish (Mexico) read
"##submission.versionIdentity##" for every entry, on the current and
the older page, and for the server's label line, which read
"##common.publication## ##navigation.breadcrumbSeparator##
##submission.versionIdentity##"; the links still opened their versions.
Other raw keys: Japanese, the breadcrumb separator (journal), also
`common.publication` and `submissions.published` (server); Spanish
(Mexico), the skip links, `common.search`, the breadcrumb,
`submission.downloads`, `submissions.published` (server),
`submission.updatedOn`, `submission.versions` and
`submission.outdatedVersion` (the whole older notice). The press's page
showed `submission.synopsis` and `catalog.published` in Japanese, the
monograph page's business.

<a id="fn-q8"></a>
**q8** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 11; Settings bullets 1–3; OPS4;
OJS9), OJS and OPS, signed out: "PDF" opened the PDF reader; "HTML"
opened the HTML reader on the journal and downloaded `preprint.html` on
the server, the browser staying on the preprint's page (also for the
French "/html-fr" galley pressed from the French page); an XML galley
opened the journal's page laid out by Lens ("Abstract", "Main Text",
"Introduction", "Contents", "Info"), its script failing as it loaded
("Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Queue')"), and
downloaded `article.xml` on the server; `notes.md` / `not-an-image.txt`
downloaded with the browser on the article's page; the remote galley
landed on its remote address. With "PDF.JS PDF Viewer", "HTML Article
Galley" or "eLife Lens Article Viewer" unticked, its galley downloaded.

<a id="fn-q9"></a>
**q9** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 12; A2), OJS and OPS, an article
with a PDF and (journal) an HTML galley in both versions, the second
version's title ending " second": the older version's readers showed
"This is an outdated version published on 2026-09-25. Read the most
recent version." ("September 25, 2026" in the HTML reader); the arrow
and the title opened the article's unversioned page; the PDF reader's
title was the older version's, the HTML reader's the current one's with
the older version's file in its frame. The older PDF reader showed "0 of
0" in an empty viewer with no message (the viewer's file request
answered "not found", twice per visit) and its "Download" got no file.
With the galley's URL Path "pdf" kept into the new version, the older
reader showed the document; after "Change File" on the new version's
galley it showed the replacement file; with the copy's URL Path changed
and a new galley "New" given "pdf" and a file of its own, it showed
nothing again (two runs per app).
Walked 2026-10-04 (Rule 12a; A13), `main` and 3.5, OJS and OPS, a new
version made with "Create New Version" and opened with "Preview": its
PDF reader read "This is an outdated version published on . Read the
most recent version." on both, and OJS's HTML reader, on an HTML galley
added to the new version, "This is an outdated version published on
October 4, 2026. Read the most recent version.", the day of the walk
(the walk and the cause are in [f-a13](#fn-f-a13) and the issue report
[docs/issues/U13-A13-new-version-preview-reader-called-outdated.md](../issues/U13-A13-new-version-preview-reader-called-outdated.md)).

<a id="fn-q10"></a>
**q10** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 13; OPS3), OJS and OPS, signed
out: a PDF galley with URL Path "pdf" typed at its number address
forwarded to `…/pdf` on the journal and answered "404 Not Found" on the
server; "/nosuchgalley" answered "404 Not Found" on both; after "pdf"
was changed to "pdfnew" on a new version, `…/pdf` opened the article's
page on both, and so did an older galley's number without a version
part when that galley had no URL Path. Live-probed 2026-10-05 (Rule 13;
OJS14; OPS3), OJS and OPS, two runs each, signed out, an article with
galleys "PDF" (URL Path "pdf") and "Print" (none) and a second version
made with "Create New Version" and published (in one case the copy's
"PDF" renamed "pdfnew" first): the current "PDF" by number forwarded to
`…/pdf` (`…/pdfnew`) on the journal; an older galley's number without
a version part opened the article's page for "Print" and answered "404
Not Found" for "PDF", on both apps; every number address of a galley
with a URL Path answered "404 Not Found" on the server, with or without
a version part; `…/nosuchgalley` answered "404 Not Found" under the
number and under the article's URL Path.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — "How to Cite": `plugins/generic/citationStyleLanguage/CitationStyleLanguagePlugin.php`
(OJS and OPS copies identical outside the vendored CSL data): `register()`
hooks `ArticleHandler::view` and `PreprintHandler::view` to
`getTemplateData()`, and `Templates::Article::Details` to
`addCitationMarkup()`, which appends `templates/citation-block.blade` at
the end of the OJS side column; OPS prints its own copy inline in
`preprint_details.tpl` (`{if $citation}`). Styles: `getCitationStyles()`
defaults with APA `isPrimary`, titles `plugins.generic.citationStyleLanguage.style.*`
("ABNT", "ACM", "ACS", "AMA", "APA", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "MLA",
"Turabian", "Vancouver"); downloads `getCitationDownloads()` ("Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley
(RIS)", "BibTeX"). Headings `submission.howToCite` "How to Cite",
`submission.howToCite.citationFormats` "More Citation Formats",
`submission.howToCite.downloadCitation` "Download Citation". The format
links carry `data-json-href`; `js/articleCitation.js` fetches it and
replaces `#citationOutput`, restoring the old citation silently when the
fetch fails. `getCitation()` builds title, `container-title` (journal
name), `container-title-short` (abbreviation, else acronym), volume and
issue, section, pages, article number, authors, URL, DOI, `issued` (the
shown version's date) and `original-date` (the first version's, set only
when its `datePublished` differs from the shown version's, so two
versions of one day never print it). On a preprint server
`getTemplateData()` reads `$issue` and `$chapter`, which only the journal
and press branches set, and the compiled citation template reads
`container-title-short`, which a preprint's citation data lacks: each
rendering logs PHP warnings ("Undefined variable $issue", "Undefined
variable $chapter", "Undefined property: stdClass::$container-title-short"),
with no effect on the page (test run 2026-09-25, the OPS server log).
`downloadCitation()` names the file `urlencode(substr(title, 0, 60))` plus
the format's extension; `templates/citation-styles/ris.blade` formats
its dates with strftime patterns (`'%Y/%m/%d'`) through
`Carbon::format()`, which prints the "%" (A8). The "Citation Style
Language" plugin is off on a new context (seed facts, all three apps,
2026-09-23).
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, "How to Cite"; Rules 15, 15a, 15b), OJS
and OPS: off on a new context there was no block; on, the APA citation
of the shown version under "How to Cite". "More Citation Formats"
toggled a list of the eleven formats, with "Download Citation",
"Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley (RIS)" and "BibTeX" under them; each format
replaced the citation in place with one request, the address unchanged
and the list closing; a reload showed APA again. The citations carried
the title, the contributors, the name, the issue "1(1)" and pages
"12-34" (journal), the date and the address as Rule 15 says; the
downloads came as files named after the first 60 characters of the title
with "+" for spaces, starting "TY  - JOUR" and "@article{…". An older
version's citation named its own title and "September 1, 2026" where
the current one's read "September 25, 2026". OMP control: the same list
on a book page. Test run 2026-09-25 (Rule 15), OJS and OPS: with both
versions published the same day, the current version's "APA" citation
read "Author, A. (2026). Tidal Patterns Revised. {journal}, 1(1).
{address}" ("… In {server name}. {address}" on the server), with no
"(Original work published …)".

<a id="fn-q11"></a>
**q11** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rules 15, 15c; A7; A8; OJS1), OJS and
OPS, with the plugin on: on an article in a published issue and a posted
preprint, "MLA" replaced the citation and a reload restored APA;
"BibTeX" downloaded a ".bib" named after the title. "ABNT" printed a
preprint's title and the server's name back to back and the date "24
Sept.2026" on both apps; the RIS file's "PY" and "Y2" lines read
"%2026/%09/%01" and "%2026/%09/%25". On a journal article published with
no issue, and on one published with "Assign To Future Issue and Publish
Immediately": signed out, a format left the citation unchanged and a
download opened a blank page; as the Reader, the Author and an
unassigned Section Editor, the citation stayed and the downloads showed
"404 Not Found"; as the Journal Manager, an assigned Section Editor and
an assigned Copyeditor, both worked. On the preprint server every role
got every format and download (OMP control: a published book's "MLA"
and "BibTeX" worked signed out).

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — Settings window: `CitationStyleLanguageSettingsForm.php` with
`templates/settings.tpl`; labels `plugins.generic.citationStyleLanguage.settings.citationFormatsPrimary`
"Primary Citation Format" and its description, `…citationFormats`
"Additional Citation Formats", `…citationDownloads` "Downloadable
Formats", `…publisherLocation` "Publisher Location"; `execute()` stores
the four settings and posts `common.changesSaved` "Your changes have been
saved."; the row's "Settings" (`manager.plugins.settings`) comes from
`getActions()` only while the plugin is enabled. With no
`primaryCitationStyle` stored the form checks no radio and
`getPrimaryStyleName()` falls back to APA. Who reaches Settings › Website:
[→ settings access](U07-journal-identity-and-about-pages.md#settings-access).
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the settings window; Rule 16; Side
effects; Settings bullets 4, 5), OJS and OPS, with a press as the
control: the row's arrow and "Settings" showed only while the plugin was
ticked; the window, titled "Citation Style Language", opened with no
primary format chosen, all eleven additional formats and both download
formats ticked and "Publisher Location" empty, its buttons "Cancel" and
"OK". "OK" closed it with "Your changes have been saved."; "Cancel"
after changes to all four fields stored nothing and asked nothing; the
window's "Close" after a change asked "The data on this form has
changed. Do you wish to continue without saving?", leaving the page
asked "Leave site?", and the window reopened unchanged. Ticking the
plugin showed "The plugin "Citation Style Language" has been enabled."
(also on the press); unticking asked "Are you sure you want to disable
this plugin?" and then showed "…has been disabled."; ticked again, the
window and the block came back with IEEE, one format and "London, U.K."
as left. The press's window reads "…on your book landing page.".

<a id="fn-q12"></a>
**q12** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 16; A9), OJS and OPS: "IEEE"
chosen, every additional format but "MLA" and the "BibTeX" box unticked,
"London, U.K." typed, "OK": every published article showed IEEE first at
once, the list offered "MLA" alone and "Download Citation" "Endnote/Zotero/Mendeley
(RIS)" alone. "London, U.K." appeared in no on-screen format of a journal
article, and in "ABNT", "ACS", "Chicago", "Harvard", "IEEE", "Turabian"
and "Vancouver" for a preprint ("… London, U.K., Sept. 24 …" in IEEE);
the "BibTeX" file carried `place={London, U.K.}` on both, the RIS file
nothing. Both download formats unticked: "Download Citation" left with
its label. Every additional format unticked: "More Citation Formats"
still showed, both downloads were in the page, and pressing it twice
left the list closed.
Since pkp/pkp-lib#7527 (seen 2026-10-02 at the PR heads, before their
merge: pkp-lib `e65cccce28`, ojs `5fc8e612d0`, ops `a7fad57355`,
citationStyleLanguage `e181beaf8c`), the place is recorded on the article
when it is published (`publisherLocation`, from this box while the plugin
is on) and the citations read that record; only an article never
recorded reads the box (OMP: the press's "Geographical Location" first).
An article published with the box empty printed no place after "London,
U.K." was typed, in IEEE and in the "BibTeX" file, on OJS and OPS.

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — Chart: `article_details.tpl` / `preprint_details.tpl` print the
section when `$activeTheme->getOption('displayStats') != 'none'`,
calling `ThemePlugin::displayUsageStatsGraph()`; heading
`plugins.themes.default.displayStats.downloads` "Downloads", hidden text
`…displayStats.noStats` "Download data is not yet available.", removed by
`lib/pkp/js/usage-stats-chart.js` on `usageStatsChartLoaded.pkp` whatever
the data. `UsageEvent` fires in `view()` for the page and in
`download()` for a galley's own file.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 17; Side effects; Settings bullet 6; A3),
all three apps: "Usage statistics display options" offered the three
choices, "Do not display…" ticked on a new context; bar and line each
added a section headed "Downloads" after the abstract with that chart,
nothing plotted over the current year's months, and the sentence was
gone once the chart drew; "Do not display…" again removed the section.
Each page opening wrote one usage event and each PDF reader opening and
"Download" one file event to the install's usage log; nothing processed
them, the chart stayed empty and the server's home read "Downloads: 0".

<a id="fn-m"></a>
**m** — References: OJS `article_details.tpl` and OPS
`preprint_details.tpl` both test `{if count($parsedCitations) || (string)
$publication->getData('citationsRaw')}`. Until ops `dafd9b3263`
(pkp/ops#1443, commit `26031aac38`, merged 2026-10-09, for
pkp/pkp-lib#13189) OPS's condition had no `(string)` cast and tested the
value `PublicationDAO::fromRow()` sets, an object that is always true,
hence the empty heading the 2026-09-25 probe below read
([Citations & references](U42-citations-and-references.md), its A20,
the entry this change answers). Each citation prints `Citation::getRawCitationWithLinks()`,
whose pattern links an address up to the next space or bracket and trims
only a trailing "." or "," (A10), and calls
`Templates::Article::Details::Reference`
(`Templates::Preprint::Details::Reference`), where the Crossref plugin adds
reference DOIs (*DOIs*). The citations spec's Rule 27 describes the same
block with its own probes; the block's rules live here from this spec on.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 18; A10), OJS and OPS: five references
showed under "References" in the main column, one paragraph each, in
list order, as typed ("Smith & Jones (2020). Values < 5 and > 3
matter."); each https or ftp address was a link opening a new tab, a
trailing "." or "," outside it, and "(ftp://files.example.org/ridge/data.csv)"
linked with its ")". A context with the References box unticked on its
Metadata settings still showed an article's references. An article with
none showed no heading on the journal and an empty "References" heading
on the server.
Walked 2026-10-09 (Rules 6, 18; scenario 1), OJS and OPS on PKP's
default dataset, each side on a newly loaded copy. At ops `6614af8281`,
the commit under the merge, the preprint "The Facets Of Job Satisfaction:
A Nine-Nation Comparative Study Of Construct Equivalence", which has no
references, showed the heading "References" with nothing under it; at ops
`dafd9b3263` its page showed no "References" heading. The journal's
article "Antimicrobial, heavy metal resistance and plasmid profile of
coliforms isolated from nosocomial infections in a hospital in Isfahan,
Iran", which has none either, showed no heading on either side. A preprint
given the one reference "Ridge, A. (2021). Tide tables u42r9." in a new
posted version showed "References" over that reference on both sides.

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — Publication Facts Label: `plugins/generic/pflPlugin/PflPlugin.php`
(OJS only), `displayArticlePfl()` on `Templates::Article::Details`, left
out when `$section->getMetaReviewed()` is false (the section form's
`manager.sections.submissionReview` "Will not be peer-reviewed", stored
inverted; the seed sets `metaReviewed` true) or when the setting
`dateStart` is after the article's `dateSubmitted`; `templates/pfl.tpl`
mounts `<publication-facts-label>` and fetches labels from
`pfl/locale/{locale}.json` (`en.json`: "Publication Facts", "Peer
reviewers", "Data availability", "External funding", "Competing
interests", "Articles accepted", "Days to publication", "Indexed in",
"Editorial team list", "Society", "Publisher"). On this build the
plugin's hooks use two constants it does not import (`STATUS_PUBLISHED`,
`STYLE_SEQUENCE_LAST`), so both fail on every article page (OJS5).
Settings: `PflSettingsForm.php` with `templates/settings.tpl`; DOAJ,
Latindex and MEDLINE are checked by outbound requests on the online
ISSN, `academicSocietyUrl` by `FormValidatorUrl`, `scopusUrl` against
`^https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/[0-9]+$`, `wosUrl` against
`^https://mjl.clarivate.com`, `dateStart` by `strtotime()`; the warning
block shows when `PluginRegistry::getPlugin('generic', 'FundingPlugin')`
is absent or disabled.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the settings window; Settings bullet 7;
OJS2), OJS: the plugin row showed "Settings" only while ticked; the
window, titled "Publication Facts Label plugin", opened every time with
"Funding Plugin Not Present" and "The Funding plugin is not present and
enabled. In order for funding data to be presented by the Publication
Facts Label, this plugin will need to be installed and enabled, and
provided with the relevant data for each submission. Check the Plugin
Gallery for this plugin.", then "Journal Information", "Exclude by
Date", "Journal's Index Listings", "Automated Listing of Indexes in the
PFL" and "Manual Listing of Indexes in the PFL"; its buttons "Cancel"
and "OK", its "Close" after a change asking the same question as the
citation window. "Will not be peer-reviewed" was unticked on a new
journal's "Articles". The Plugin Gallery could not be searched: its list
answers a server error on the test installs.

<a id="fn-q13"></a>
**q13** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 19; OJS3; OJS5), OJS: with the
plugin on, no article page showed the panel, signed out or as the
Reader, after a full valid save, with "Start Date" 2099-01-01 or
2020-01-01, with "Will not be peer-reviewed" ticked or unticked, and on
the French page, which fetched no label file either. Each page answered
normally; the server log recorded the plugin failing in both its hooks.

<a id="fn-q15"></a>
**q15** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the settings window; OJS7;
OJS8), OJS: "not a url" and "http://nodot" in the society "URL" were
refused in the window with "Please enter a valid URL." and no save was
sent; a valid name and address saved and came back. "Start Date" took
"2099-01-01" and "2020-01-01" typed key by key; "notadate" left the box
empty; "2026-99-99" stayed in the box, "OK" showed "Your changes have
been saved." and the box was empty on reopening. Ticking "Directory of
Open Access Journals", "Latindex" or "MEDLINE" was refused with the
"could not be verified" notice, with and without an online ISSN
("0378-5955", saved on Settings › Journal › "Masthead", which refuses
"Save" until "Country" is chosen), the three together in one notice;
"Google Scholar" alone saved. "https://example.org/x" in the Scopus
"URL" and "https://example.org/y" in the Web of Science one were refused
with their messages, in a notice and in the window;
"https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/12345" and
"https://mjl.clarivate.com/search-results?issn=0378-5955" saved. After
each refusal the window showed the saved values: the stored Scopus
address in place of the typed one, "Directory of Open Access Journals"
unticked again. "Cancel" after a change stored nothing.

<a id="fn-n"></a>
**n** — Recommendations: `plugins/generic/recommendByAuthor/RecommendByAuthorPlugin.php::callbackTemplateArticlePageFooter()`
on `Templates::Article::Footer::PageFooter` builds a paginator over
`APP\search\SubmissionSearchResult::newCollection()`, whose items carry
`submission`, `currentPublication`, `context`, `section`, `issue`;
`templates/articleFooter.tpl` reads `publishedSubmission` and `journal`,
keys the collection has not carried since the search rebuild (OJS4). Ten a
page (`RECOMMEND_BY_AUTHOR_PLUGIN_COUNT`), heading
`plugins.generic.recommendByAuthor.heading` "Most read articles by the
same author(s)". `plugins/generic/recommendBySimilarity/RecommendBySimilarityPlugin.php::buildTemplate()`
searches the article's keywords (`Repo::controlledVocab()->getBySymbolic()`)
through the submission collector's `searchPhrase()`, ten a page, heading
"Similar Articles", `…advancedSearchIntro` "You may also
{$advancedSearchLink} for this article." with `…advancedSearch` "start an
advanced similarity search". It joins the keyword entries into the
phrase without taking their names, and its query keeps only articles
outside a published issue, so an article in a published issue is never a
candidate (OJS10). The search index is filled by queued jobs, which the
test installs run only on demand (seed facts; [Search](U15-search.md)).
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 20; Fields, "Recommendations"): neither
list appeared on any page, so where the lists sit under the article
rests on the hook's name; note q14.

<a id="fn-q14"></a>
**q14** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Rule 20; Settings bullets 8, 9; OJS4;
OJS10), OJS: with "Recommend Articles by Author" on, the pages of two
articles by the same contributor, of an article whose contributor has
ten others and of an article whose contributor has none all opened
normally, signed out, as the Reader and as the Journal Manager, with no
"Most read articles by the same author(s)"; the server log recorded
"Call to a member function getCurrentPublication() on null" for each
page whose contributor has another article, nothing for the other; with
the plugin off the page opened the same. With "Recommend Similar
Articles" on, an article whose two keywords twelve other published
articles share showed no "Similar Articles", before and after the queued
jobs ran, signed out and as the Reader; nothing was logged. On a new
journal both plugins were listed unticked; ticking each showed "The
plugin "…" has been enabled.", with no "Settings" on their rows.

<a id="fn-j"></a>
**j** — Summary: OJS `templates/frontend/objects/article_summary.tpl`,
included by `issue_toc.tpl`, `latest_article.tpl` (the home page,
`indexJournal.tpl`), `catalogCategory.tpl` (`hideGalleys=true`) and
`search.tpl` (`showDatePublished=true hideGalleys=true`); OPS
`templates/frontend/objects/preprint_summary.tpl`, included by
`indexServer.tpl`, `preprints.tpl`, `sections.tpl`, `catalogCategory.tpl`
and `search.tpl` (the last two `hideGalleys=true`). Author line: shown
when the section's `hideAuthor` is off and the publication's
`hideAuthor` is the default, or the publication forces it; the
per-publication switch has no control on any form. The section's box
is read by the issue's table of contents only. The main-galley filter
runs only where `primaryGenreIds` is assigned, which
`IssueHandler::setupIssueTemplate()` does, for the issue's page and for
the home page, `IndexHandler` calling it while the home page shows the
current issue; "Latest Publications" on the same page inherits it (A4).
"Latest Publications" reads `Submission\Collector::filterByLatestPublished()`
(OJS `classes/submission/Collector.php`), which keeps only current
publications whose `issue_id` is null or whose issue is unpublished
(the appearance spec's Rule 13 and OJS3). OPS DOI line: a
loop over `$pubIdPlugins` for type `doi`; DOIs are no `pubIds` plugin,
and OPS ships no `plugins/pubIds` at all (OPS6). OPS details:
`publication.galley.downloads` "Downloads: {$downloads}",
`submission.dates` "Submitted {$submitted} - Posted {$published}",
`submission.numberOfVersions` "Versions: {$numberOfVersions}". Section
option `manager.sections.hideTocAuthor` "Omit author names for section
items from issues' table of contents.".
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Fields, the article summary; Rule 22; Settings
bullet 10; OPS6; OPS9), OJS and OPS, signed out, as the Reader and as
the Journal Manager: summaries on the journal's issue table of contents,
"Current Issue", "Latest Publications", category page and search
results, and on the server's "Latest preprints", "Archives" (the main
menu's "Archives", headed "Archives"), section and category pages and
search results. The cover and the title (with "Alpha subtitle") linked
to the article's address and opened it when pressed; the author line
read "Ann Author (Author)"; "12-34" under an article with pages (OJS);
the preprint's keywords "kfive", "alpha", only the current version's;
"Downloads: 0 - Submitted 2026-09-25 - Posted 2026-09-25", then " -
Versions: 2" for a preprint with two versions; the date "2026-09-25" on
the journal's search results only; no galleys on search and category
pages; no DOI line on any preprint summary although the preprint's page
showed "DOI:". On the server's home and "Archives" lists the keyword row
lay across the middle of the cover, where a press opened nothing, while
the top and the bottom opened the preprint (two runs). "Omit author
names…" was unticked on the seeded "Articles" and "Reviews" and on a new
section; ticked and saved, it removed the author line from the issue's
table of contents and "Current Issue" only. A preprint server's section
form has no such box. Test run 2026-09-25 (Rule 22), OJS: with both of a
journal's articles published in its current, published issue and
"Latest Publications" chosen in the theme, the home page showed the
categories and "Current Issue", listing both articles, and no "Latest
Publications" section.

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — Open peer review: `ArticleHandler::view()` builds an
`OpenReviewComponent` and passes its locale keys, icons, constants and
`openReviewConfig` to the page, but no OJS template mounts the
open-review display, so the page never calls the `peerReviews` API.
"Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" is the review assignment's public
visibility; the journal's default comes from its review settings.
Live-probed 2026-09-28 (Rule 23; OJS12), OJS, two runs, on a scratch
journal whose review type is "Open" and whose public visibility
default is off: two articles in review, each with one submitted Open
review whose "For author and editor" comment carried a unique text. On
the first the Journal Manager ticked the box in the reviewer row's
"More Actions" › "Edit" (saved 200, ticked on reopen), then "Read
Review" › "Mark as Complete": the dialog read "Mark this review as
complete? This review will be made publicly visible alongside the
article. You can still modify this review after marking it as
complete. You will have the opportunity to thank the reviewer in the
next step.", `…/reviewAssignments/{id}/consider` answered 200 and the
row read "Complete". On the second the box stayed unticked and the
dialog lacked the "publicly visible" sentence. Both were accepted and
published with no issue (200). Each page, read signed out (also after a
reload), as the journal's Reader and as the Journal Manager, read the
title, the author, "Abstract", "Published 2026-09-28", "Versions
2026-09-28 (Version of Record 1.0)" and "Section Articles", nothing
else; neither review's text was in the page, its source or the
journal's home page, and the page made no `/peerReviews` request. The
source carries only the display's locale strings ("Full Review", "Cite
this peer review report:", "Read Review", "Hide Review"). Controls: a
posted preprint's page showed no review words and the server's workflow
has no review stage; a press's book page seeded with a completed public
Open review showed none either (the *Monograph landing page*'s
surface). No request failed.

<a id="fn-o"></a>
**o** — Plugin defaults: `settings.xml` with `enabled` true in
`plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer`, `htmlArticleGalley` and `lensGalley`,
installed for each new context; `citationStyleLanguage`, `pflPlugin`,
`recommendByAuthor` and `recommendBySimilarity` declare none and stay off.

a new journal and server, note q16. Live-probed 2026-10-05 (Settings
bullet 3; Rule 11; OJS15), OJS and OPS, two runs on scratch contexts:
the new journal's list showed "eLife Lens Article Viewer" ticked; with
it on the article's "XML" opened the Lens page, its script failing with
"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Queue')" (OJS9), and
with it off downloaded `article.xml`, the browser staying on the
article's page. The server's 26-row list had no "eLife Lens Article
Viewer" and no "HTML Article Galley" row, and "PDF.JS PDF Viewer"
ticked.

<a id="fn-q16"></a>
**q16** — Live-probed 2026-09-25 (Settings bullets 1–4, 7–9; OPS4), OJS
and OPS, a new scratch journal and server, Settings › Website ›
"Plugins" › "Installed Plugins", "Generic Plugins": the journal listed
"PDF.JS PDF Viewer", "HTML Article Galley" and "eLife Lens Article
Viewer" ticked, "Citation Style Language", "Publication Facts Label
plugin", "Recommend Articles by Author" and "Recommend Similar Articles"
unticked; the server "PDF.JS PDF Viewer" ticked, "Citation Style
Language" unticked and none of the other five. Unticking asked "Are you
sure you want to disable this plugin?" and showed "The plugin "…" has
been disabled."; a PDF galley then downloaded. A press (the control)
lists "PDF.js PDF Viewer" and "HTML Monograph File" and none of the
three journal-only rows.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Scenario seeding. The seeded journal and server
(`publicknowledge`) carry no published item (seed facts), so every
scenario publishes its own articles through `POST scenarios/submission`
(`published: true`, submitter the context's author); galleys come from
`galleys[]` (`{label, file}`, `{label, urlRemote}`, with `locale`,
`urlPath` and `genre` where a scenario names them), the display values
from the version keys (`subtitle`, `plainLanguageSummary`, `keywords`,
`categories`, `coverImage` with the fixture `profile-image-400.png`,
OJS `articleNumber`, `urlPath`) and the references from `citationsRaw`.
Fixtures: `article.pdf`, `article.html`, `article.xml`, `notes.md` on
OJS; `preprint.pdf`, `preprint.html`, `not-an-image.txt` on OPS. In the
scenarios {journal address} is the context's address, {number} the
submission's id and {today} the day of the run, written as the pages
write it. Scenarios 1 and 4 run on `publicknowledge`: scenario 1 signed
out, submitter `author.alex`, its first article with OJS `section:
'ART'`, `issue: {volume: 1, number: 2, year: 2014}` and `categories: ['eng']`
(the leaf path; the seed refuses the full path), its second with no `issue` (an article in no
issue); scenario 4 with the ready accounts `manager.maya`, `author.alex`
(the submitter) and `reader.rosa`, passwords as users.md gives them, the
unpublished article carried to Production by OJS `decisions:
['sendExternalReview', 'accept', 'sendToProduction']` (a submitted
preprint already sits there) and the scheduled one by `published: true`
with `issue: {volume: 2, number: 1, year: 2015}` (seed facts). The
others run on their own scratch context from `POST scenarios/context`,
with throwaway `users[]` (password: the username twice): `manager` and
`author` everywhere, `reader` in scenario 5; OJS contexts that need a
published issue seed `issues: [{volume: 1, number: 1, year: 2026,
published: true}]` and publish into it with `issue`. Per scenario:
scenario 2 at the context's defaults; scenario 3 with `plugins:
{citationstylelanguageplugin: {enabled: true}}`, its second version
made on screen as `manager`, since no key makes one ("Create New
Version", the title changed on "Title & Abstract", then "Publish":
[Publish, schedule & versions](U49-publish-schedule-and-versions.md),
scenarios 4 and 5); scenario 5 with `context.enabled: false` for the
first context and `restrictSiteAccess: true` ("Users must be
registered…") for the second; scenario 6 with `context.name` "Coastal
Review" ("Coastal Preprints") and the same `plugins` entry, the
visitor's steps read against the mail catcher (Mailpit,
`http://127.0.0.1:8025`) scoped by the context's addresses; scenario 7
with `plugins: {pdfjsviewerplugin: {enabled: false}}` and `themeOptions:
{displayStats: 'bar'}`; scenario 8 with `context.supportedLocales` and
`supportedSubmissionLocales` `['en', 'fr_CA']`, the title, abstract and
`keywords` as locale maps and the "HTML" galley at `locale: 'fr_CA'`
(a `/fr_CA/` address switches the session to French, seed facts, so the
English page is read first and the control opens `/en/` again);
scenario 9 (OJS) with `categories: [{path: 'oceans', title: 'Oceans'}]`,
the issue's `coverImage`, and `themeOptions: {journalContentOrganization:
[1, 2, 3]}` (the categories, "Latest Publications" and "Current
Issue"); scenario 10 (OPS) with the same `categories`. Scenarios 9
(OJS) and 10 (OPS) run in each app's serial project: a category page
lists what the search index holds, which only the queued jobs the test
runs fill. "Omit author
names…", a contributor's Bio Statement (after "Country" is picked), the
URN "Assign", the public JATS XML and the Crossmark box are set on
screen; the upload and the seed refuse "Image" and "HTML Stylesheet"
galleys, and no key sets a version's DOI. Live-probed 2026-09-25: the
seeded journal's home page showed "Current Issue" and no "Latest
Publications"; a scratch journal seeded with the option showed the
categories, "Latest Publications" and "Current Issue". "Latest
Publications" is absent while no article sits outside a published issue,
so scenario 9's home page, whose two articles are in the issue, has
none (note j).

<a id="fn-f-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — Note g: `publication.versionStage.display` and the version
stage keys are missing from `lib/pkp/locale/fr_CA`. First seen 2026-09-24
in passing during the appearance spec's claim check (a press's book page
also labels its date "##catalog.published##", the monograph page's
business); live-probed 2026-09-25 on both apps and the press (note q5),
the date printed "2026-09-24" in French as in English. Live-probed
2026-10-05 (note q5): the French key held on a journal, a preprint
server and a press's book page. How new texts
reach translators, and what the proposed fix would show, are read from
the code: no screen on this build shows them.

<a id="fn-f-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — `PdfJsViewerPlugin::submissionCallback()` builds `pdfUrl` from
`[$submission->getBestId(), $galley->getBestGalleyId(), $galley->getFile()->getId()]`
with no `version` part; `ArticleHandler::initialize()` (and OPS's) then
looks the galley up in the current publication, finds it in an older
published one only, and redirects to the unversioned `download` op with
no galley, which answers `NotFoundHttpException`; pdf.js then logs
"MissingPDFException" in the page. The reader's "Download" link carries
the same address with a `download` attribute, so the browser saves
nothing and stays. A copied galley with the same URL Path resolves in
the current publication instead, and serves the file the copy shares
with the published galley ([Galleys](U46-galleys.md), its A4: "Change
File" on the new version's galley changes the published version's
file). The HTML and Lens readers build versioned addresses. Live-probed

**f-a7** — The "ABNT" answer for a preprint reads

The same mistake, a `strftime()` pattern handed to Carbon, sits in
templates of plugins only OJS ships, each registered where its screen
is: the MARC field 008 of the OAI-PMH records
([OAI-PMH, A15](U19-oai-pmh.md#a15)) and the announcement feeds' Atom
and RSS 1.0 dates ([Announcements, A15](U12-announcements.md#a15)), both
seen on screen; and the COUNTER report's `Created` attribute
(`reportxml.tpl`, `sushixml.tpl`; code, not driven). Read 2026-10-01

<a id="fn-f-a11"></a>
**f-a11** — Note c: `PKP\publication\DAO::fromRow()` reads the keyword
entries (with the subjects, disciplines and supporting agencies) with
no `orderBy`; the `seq` that `controlledVocab\Repository::insertBySymbolic()`
writes 1, 2, … is never read. The order returned follows the query plan
(a hash on the entries gives the reverse of the rows' order on disk, a
hash on the vocabularies the disk order) and the rows' place on disk.
Every publication save (`DAO::update()` → `saveControlledVocab()`),
publishing and scheduling included, deletes the entries and writes them
again in the order just read. Seen on OPS test runs 2026-09-25 (twice)
and 2026-09-26 (scenarios 1 and 10): keywords seeded "tide", "current"
read "Keywords: current, tide"; in the OJS test database on 2026-09-26
the same seed's keywords were stored "current" first after the seed's
publish on four runs, in the typed order on later ones. Probed
2026-09-26, OJS and OPS: moving one keyword's row on disk turned
scenario 1's line to "current, tide" on four runs of four; four plain
"Save"s on Publication › Metadata kept "alpha, beta, gamma".

<a id="fn-f-a12"></a>
**f-a12** — Note g: `firstPublication` is the earliest `datePublished`
among all of the submission's publications, whatever their status, and
an unpublish keeps the date (the versions spec's Rule 9); the same pick
is behind the versions spec's A6. Live-probed 2026-09-28, note g, OJS
and OPS, two runs.

<a id="fn-f-a13"></a>
**f-a13** — Note d: `PdfJsViewerPlugin` (identical in OJS and OPS)
decides the outdated notice from `isLatestPublication` alone, with no
test for a preview; a new, unpublished version is never the current one
while an older version is published, so its preview's reader gets the
notice, dated with the version's own empty `datePublished`. OJS's HTML
reader (`htmlArticleGalley`) decides the same way (code, not driven).
Walked 2026-10-01 on PKP's default test data, `main` and 3.5, from the
first galley link of a preview: OPS's PDF reader, for a new version made
with "Create New Version", read "This is an outdated version published
on . Read the most recent version."; OJS's, for the unpublished version
1.1 that the test data ships with a date of its own, read that date.
Left out of the fix in OPS1's issue report:
[pkp-e2e#209](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/209) ([docs/issues/U13-OPS1-new-version-preview-called-outdated.md](../issues/U13-OPS1-new-version-preview-called-outdated.md)).
Re-walked 2026-10-04, `main` and 3.5, OJS and OPS, with a new version
made on screen: the PDF reader read the blank date on both, and OJS's
HTML reader, on an HTML galley added to the new version, read the
notice dated the day of the walk; OMP's preview file link answered "404
Not Found" (`CatalogBookHandler::download()` refuses an unpublished
version), so its viewers are not reached.

**f-a14** — Note h: `citation-styles/associacao-brasileira-de-normas-tecnicas.csl`
was replaced whole in May 2026 (`pkp/citationStyleLanguage#165`, on
3.5 `#164`), which refreshed every style from the CSL styles
repository's `v1.0.1` branch and took that repository's file of the same
name, a different style (NBR 6023:2002). The plugin had shipped the
"Universidade de São Paulo - Escola de Comunicações e Artes - ABNT"
style (NBR 6023:2018), chosen in `pkp/citationStyleLanguage#73`; its
3.4 branch still ships it. Walked 2026-10-01 on PKP's default test
data, OJS and OPS `main` and 3.5: a preprint's "ABNT" read "KWANTES,
C.; KEKKONEN, U. The Facets Of Job Satisfaction: … Disponível em:
{address}. Acesso em: 1 oct. 2026", a journal article's "KARBASIZAED,
V. Antimicrobial, heavy metal resistance … Journal of Public
Knowledge, v. 1, n. 2, 30 Sept.2026.". The earlier file's output rests
on the plugin's history and was not walked. Raised for the team in A7's
issue report:

**f-a15** — Note g: each entry is `submission.versionIdentity`

holds it with an empty `msgstr`, and `lib/pkp/locale/es_MX/submission.po`
has no entry; `stable-3_5_0`'s files are the same, and its `locale/en`
carries the key, so the 3.5 release shows it too (by the code, not
walked). By the code, 25 of the 70 other languages have no text for it
(12 lack the entry, 8 hold it empty, 5 have no `submission.po`); A1's
proposed fix leaves them out. Live-probed 2026-10-05, note q5, two runs:

<a id="fn-f-a16"></a>
**f-a16** — Note b: on `main`, `Repo::submission()->canPreview()`
(lib/pkp `classes/submission/Repository.php:580-603`) returns true
through `_roleCanPreview()` (`:1530-1551`) for any user holding
`ROLE_ID_MANAGER`, `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT` or
`ROLE_ID_SUBSCRIPTION_MANAGER` in the context, reading no assignment and
no stage; the workflow's `SubmissionAccessPolicy` admits sub-editors and
assistants only when assigned. Callers: OJS `ArticleHandler` (page and
galley download), OPS `PreprintHandler`, OMP `CatalogBookHandler`, and
`PKPJatsController::publicDownload()`
(`submissions/{id}/publications/{pid}/jats/download`, a route new on
`main`, pkp/pkp-lib#10405). Introduced by pkp/pkp-lib#12245 (PR #12247,
`768b0a3991`, Alec Smecher, 2026-02-18), which deleted the stage limit
so that assigned editors could preview earlier stages; the role
shortcut lost it too. `b4ef319c72` (2026-05-14) only excludes incomplete
submissions. Proposed fix: managers, the Site Administrator and anyone
assigned to the submission preview it at every stage; the role shortcut
alone keeps the stage limit (`WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING`,
`WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_PRODUCTION` and `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_DONE`, where
published submissions sit). Patched into OJS and OMP `main` 2026-09-30
and reverted: the unassigned Layout Editor, Section Editor and
Proofreader got "404 Not Found" before copyediting and kept the
copyediting preview, the assigned Section Editor, the manager and the
Author were unchanged, and the JATS download answered 403 to the
unassigned. Restoring the old check at the top of `canPreview()` instead
breaks #12245: the assigned Section Editor and the Author lose the
early preview, and the manager loses a published article's unpublished
version 2. Releases: `stable-3_5_0` and `stable-3_4_0` `canPreview()`
return false outside copyediting and production, OJS `stable-3_3_0`
`IssueAction::allowedPrePublicationAccess()` refuses before
`WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING`, and the public JATS download does not exist
before `main`: 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 do not have the fault. Live-probed
2026-09-30, OJS, OMP and OPS `main`, seeded data: unassigned `gcox`
(Layout Editor), `svogt` (Copyeditor) and `minoue` (Section Editor)
opened OJS submissions 4 (Submission), 20 (Review, double-anonymous) and
18 (declined), each read with the submission API answering 401;
`cturner` (Proofreader, double-anonymous reviewer of 20) saw "Zayan
Zedd; Nargis Parvin" on 20's page while the review API gave an empty
`authorsString`; `amccrae` (Reviewer only), `zwoods` (another Author)
and signed out got 404. With 20's JATS public visibility ticked by
`dbarnes` (reset after), `cturner`, `gcox` and `minoue` downloaded its
XML naming the authors (200); `amccrae`, `zwoods` and signed out got
403. OMP: `mfritz` (Copyeditor) and `cturner` opened books 3, 6 and 18
before copyediting. OPS: only preprints 1 and 4, in production, were
walked; earlier stages by the code. The Subscription Manager: by the
code. Security-shaped and unreleased: its issue report carries
"- **Security** unreleased" (REPORT.md).

downloads work for every role. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q11.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#205](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/205) ([docs/issues/U13-OJS1-citation-formats-fail-outside-published-issue.md](../issues/U13-OJS1-citation-formats-fail-outside-published-issue.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ojs2"></a>
**f-ojs2** — `PflSettingsForm::fetch()` assigns `fundingPluginPresent`
from `PluginRegistry::getPlugin('generic', 'FundingPlugin')`; no such
plugin ships (funders are core metadata, [Funding](U43-funding.md)), so
`templates/settings.tpl` always prints
`plugins.generic.pflPlugin.fundingPluginMissing` and its description,
while `displayArticlePfl()` reads the context's `funders` setting.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note k): the warning on every opening; the
Plugin Gallery could not be searched on the test installs.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#225](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/225) ([docs/issues/U13-OJS2-publication-facts-settings-funding-warning.md](../issues/U13-OJS2-publication-facts-settings-funding-warning.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ojs3"></a>
**f-ojs3** — `templates/pfl.tpl` fetches `pfl/locale/` + `Locale::getLocale()`
+ `.json`; the folder holds `fr.json` and no `fr_CA.json`, and the fetch's
failure only logs "PFL: failed to load translations" to the console.
Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note q13): the French page showed no panel and
fetched no label file, the same as the English page. Walked 2026-10-01
on PKP's default test data, OJS 3.5 and `main` with OJS5's fix applied:
the English page showed the panel and the French (Canada) page none.
The folder holds 18 label files, and 60 of the 78 languages OJS ships
have none of their own: `fr_CA` and `es_MX`, whose labels sit under the
base language (`fr`, `es`), which the fetch never tries, and 58 more
with no labels at all (code).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#236](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/236) ([docs/issues/U13-OJS3-publication-facts-panel-missing-without-label-file.md](../issues/U13-OJS3-publication-facts-panel-missing-without-label-file.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ojs4"></a>
**f-ojs4** — Note n. The search results' shape changed with pkp-lib's
Laravel Scout rebuild (pkp/pkp-lib#8920, merged 2025-08-01), which
removed the `publishedSubmission` / `journal` keys the plugin's template
still reads; `$submission->getCurrentPublication()` on a null fails in
`articleFooter.tpl`. The app catches the error inside the hook, logs
"Plugin …RecommendByAuthorPlugin failed to handle the hook
Templates::Article::Footer::PageFooter" and serves the page without the
list. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q14.

<a id="fn-f-ojs5"></a>
**f-ojs5** — Note k: `Undefined constant
"APP\plugins\generic\pflPlugin\STATUS_PUBLISHED"` (`PflPlugin.php`, in
the side-column hook `Templates::Article::Details`) and `Undefined
constant "…\STYLE_SEQUENCE_LAST"` (in the `TemplateManager::display`
hook), each caught and logged as "Plugin …PflPlugin failed to handle the
hook …" on every article page, which still answers normally.
Live-probed 2026-09-25, notes q6 and q13.

<a id="fn-f-ojs6"></a>
**f-ojs6** — Note d: `display.tpl` picks `issue.return` whenever the page
has an issue, though its link is the article's `parentUrl`. Live-probed

<a id="fn-f-ojs8"></a>
**f-ojs8** — The date picker writes a hidden field that the form
stores, filled only as keys are typed; with "2026-99-99" the save
stored an empty start date and no refusal from the `strtotime()` check
(note k) appeared. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q15.

<a id="fn-f-ojs9"></a>
**f-ojs9** — Note e: `lensGalley`'s `display.tpl` loads MathJax 3.2.2,
while `lib/lens/lens.js` calls the MathJax 2 interface
`MathJax.Hub.Queue`; the page logs "Cannot read properties of undefined
(reading 'Queue')" on every XML galley. The test fixture has no formula,
so the typesetting loss follows from the code. Live-probed 2026-09-25,
note q8, two runs.

<a id="fn-f-ojs10"></a>
**f-ojs10** — Note n: the search phrase is built from the keyword
entries without their names ("Array Array"), and the query filters to
articles outside a published issue; nothing is logged.
Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q14.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#215](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/215) ([docs/issues/U13-OJS10-similar-articles-list-never-shown.md](../issues/U13-OJS10-similar-articles-list-never-shown.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ojs11"></a>
**f-ojs11** — Note h: CSL numbers each IEEE entry in a
`csl-left-margin` block, which the theme's and the plugin's styles hide
("Hide the bibliography number produced by some CSL styles"). OJS's
`citation-block.blade` prints the primary citation through
`ViewHelper::sanitizeHtml()`, which drops that wrapper, so "[1]" shows as
text; OPS's `preprint_details.tpl` prints `{$citation}` as it is, and the
format chosen from the list is inserted with its wrapper on both. Other
numbered formats would carry the same number; only IEEE was read. Test
run 2026-09-25, OJS: the primary citation read "[1]A. Author, “Tidal
Patterns in Coastal Waters”, Coastal Review, vol. 1, no. 1, Sept. 2026,
Accessed: Sept. 25, 2026. Available: {address}" where the chosen IEEE
citation had read the same without "[1]"; a separate drive the same
day read "[1]" before the journal's primary IEEE citation and
none before the preprint server's.

<a id="fn-f-ojs12"></a>
**f-ojs12** — Note p: the open-review display is prepared but never
mounted on the article page. Live-probed 2026-09-28, note p, OJS, two
runs, with an unticked review as the control.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#218](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/218) ([docs/issues/U13-OJS12-public-review-never-shown.md](../issues/U13-OJS12-public-review-never-shown.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ojs13"></a>
**f-ojs13** — Note n: pkp-lib 4155f5be39 (`pkp/pkp-lib#13106` for
`pkp/pkp-lib#13080`, 2026-07-30, the editorial search's relevance) made
the submission collector's `searchPhrase()` require every word of the
phrase; before, any one word matched (`pkp/pkp-lib#8710`, which moved
this plugin onto the collector with an "OR" search to bring more
results). 3.5's collector ORs the words and orders by the number
matched (code). Walked 2026-10-01 on PKP's default test data, OJS
`main` with OJS10's fix applied: under article 1 ("Professional
Development", "Social Transformation"), article 5 with both keywords was
listed and article 15 with only "Social Transformation" was not. Left
out of the fix in OJS10's issue report:
[pkp-e2e#215](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/215) ([docs/issues/U13-OJS10-similar-articles-list-never-shown.md](../issues/U13-OJS10-similar-articles-list-never-shown.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ojs14"></a>
**f-ojs14** — Note f: `ArticleHandler::initialize()` redirects a
digit-only galley path matching a galley's number to
`[$submission->getBestId(), $galley->getBestGalleyId()]`, without the
`version/{id}` part or a trailing file id; the OPS fix proposed for
OPS2 and OPS3 keeps them. Live-probed 2026-10-05, OJS (OPS as the
control), two runs on scratch journals, signed out: an article with
"PDF" (URL Path "pdf") and "Print" (none), a second version made with
"Create New Version" and published. `…/article/view/{id}/version/{v1}/{PDF
number}` answered a redirect to `…/article/view/{id}/pdf`, the current
version's PDF reader with no notice; the same with a trailing file id
(the last part of the reader's "Download" address, note f-a2) and under the article's URL Path; `…/article/download/{id}/version/{v1}/{PDF
number}/{file}` went to `…/article/download/{id}/pdf`, the current
galley's file; with the copy's URL Path changed to "pdfnew" before the
second version was published, the same address opened the article's
page. Controls: `…/version/{v1}/pdf` and `…/version/{v1}/{Print
number}` opened the older version's reader under "This is an outdated
version published on 2026-10-05. Read the most recent version."; the
server answered "404 Not Found" to every such address (note q10).
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#939](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/939) ([docs/issues/U13-OJS14-older-version-galley-id-link-opens-current.md](../issues/U13-OJS14-older-version-galley-id-link-opens-current.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ojs15"></a>
**f-ojs15** — Note o: `LensGalleyPlugin::issueCallback()`, hooked on
`IssueHandler::view::galley`, assigns `displayTemplatePath`, but the
plugin's `issueGalley.tpl` includes `$displayTemplateResource`, which
nothing sets (`articleGalley.tpl` includes `$displayTemplatePath`). The
template engine throws, the hook runner catches and logs it, and the
issue handler falls back to the download. The include dates from the
plugin's Smarty 3 update (2018, 7d70165), and `stable-3_5_0` carries it
(code, not walked). Live-probed 2026-10-05, two runs on scratch
journals, signed out: a published issue with issue galleys "XML"
(`article.xml`) and "PDF"; "XML" pressed or typed answered a redirect to
`…/issue/download/{issue}/{galley}`, `article.xml` downloaded and the
browser stayed on the issue's page, with the plugin on and off; "PDF"
opened the PDF reader "View of Vol. 1 No. 1 (2026)"; the article's
"XML" opened the Lens page. Server log, once per press or typed
address: "Plugin APP\plugins\generic\lensGalley\LensGalleyPlugin failed
to handle the hook IssueHandler::view::galley" / "TypeError:
PKP\template\PKPTemplateManager::smartyPathToViewName(): Argument #1
($template) must be of type string, null given". The page shows no
error, so the run record listed no crash.

<a id="fn-f-ops1"></a>
**f-ops1** — Note f: `preprint_details.tpl` shows the outdated notice
whenever the shown publication is not the current one, previews
included; the date it names is the day of the preview, the unpublished
version having no publication date of its own. Live-probed 2026-09-25,
note q3.

<a id="fn-f-ops2"></a>
**f-ops2** — Note f: `PreprintHandler::initialize()` overwrites the first
remaining argument (the galley or "version") with the URL Path; and
`PreprintHandler::view()` redirects a galley with no reader to
`download` with `$preprint->getId()`, the number, so every such download
passes through the broken redirect and ends at a `download` with no
galley. Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note q2): on the URL-Path preprint the
HTML link went from `…/view/probe-path/{galley}` to
`…/download/{number}/{galley}` to `…/download/probe-path`, "404 Not
Found", while the PDF opened its reader.

<a id="fn-f-ops3"></a>
**f-ops3** — Note f: OJS's `elseif (ctype_digit($galleyId) && $galley->getId() == $galleyId)`
redirect has no OPS counterpart. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note q10.
Issue report: [pkp-e2e#203](https://github.com/jardakotesovec/pkp-e2e/issues/203) ([docs/issues/U13-OPS2-OPS3-ops-number-address-url-path.md](../issues/U13-OPS2-OPS3-ops-number-address-url-path.md)).

<a id="fn-f-ops4"></a>
**f-ops4** — Note o: OPS ships neither plugin; its HTML galleys take the
download path of note e. Live-probed 2026-09-25, notes q8 and q16.

<a id="fn-f-ops5"></a>
**f-ops5** — Note d: OPS's locale files (app and lib/pkp) have neither
`article.return` nor `issue.return`, so the screen-reader text renders as
the key in `##` marks. Live-probed 2026-09-25 (note d), also on the
French page.

<a id="fn-f-ops9"></a>
**f-ops9** — Note j: the element at the cover's centre is the keyword
list laid over it. Live-probed 2026-09-25, note j, two runs. Both
default themes float the summary's cover beside its text block, which
has `position: relative` and so is painted over the cover in every row
it fills (OPS `preprint_summary.less`, OJS `article_summary.less` and
`issue_toc.less`); from tablet width the cover floats beside the text.
Walked 2026-10-01 on PKP's default test data, OJS and OPS `main` and
3.5, 1280 × 900, a 400 × 400 px cover shown 200 px tall: on the server's
"Archives" only the top 40 px and the bottom 62 px of the cover's middle
opened the preprint, the rest of the band (beside the author line, the
keywords and the details line) opened nothing; on the journal's current
issue page the author line's row, 25 px, opened nothing and the cover's
middle opened the article. A press's catalog has no such band.
