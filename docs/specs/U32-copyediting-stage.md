# Copyediting stage {OJS OMP}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

An accepted submission stops at the **Copyediting stage** before production.
Here the editor hands the accepted text to a Copyeditor: the files that came
out of review are listed as draft files, the Copyeditor uploads the polished
versions as copyedited files, and the author follows the work and answers
questions in the stage's discussions. When the copyedited files are ready,
the editor sends the submission on to Production with one decision; if the
acceptance was a mistake, a second decision moves it back to review.

This spec covers the Copyediting-stage screen itself: which panels, notices
and decision buttons each role is offered, what the two file lists hold, and
what each decision does to the submission. The guided wizard behind every
decision button (its email page and its file page) belongs to *Editorial
decision recording*; the file lists' upload and edit windows to *Submission
files*; the Participants panel to *Stage participants*; the discussions panel
to *Tasks & discussions*. Who may open a submission's workflow at all is
[→ stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-access).
<sup>q</sup>

A preprint server installs a single-stage workflow: a preprint's workflow
menu lists "Production" alone, its Roles settings screen installs no
Copyeditor role, and none of the panels, notices or decision buttons in this
file appear there [OPS1](#ops1). <sup>k</sup>

## Actors & permissions

Who may **open** the Copyediting stage at all is the shared workflow gate,
[→ stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-access): a
Journal Manager or Editor reaches it on every submission; every other role
only on submissions they are assigned to, and only when their role's stage
set includes Copyediting. By default that set includes Copyediting for
Production editor, Section Editor, Guest Editor, Copyeditor, Marketing and
sales coordinator, Author and Translator, and on a press for Volume editor
and Chapter Author too; Layout Editor, Proofreader and Funding Coordinator
are turned away with the no-access box. Translator, Volume editor and
Chapter Author are author-level roles: the editorial dashboard refuses them
("The current role does not have access to this operation.") and they open
the stage from My Submissions, in the author view (Rule 11). "Assigned
editors" below means Journal Managers, Editors, Production editors (a
manager-level role: the Roles screen lists it at the permission level
"Journal Manager") and Section and Guest Editors listed on this stage's
Participants panel. The rows record what each role is offered **on** the
screen once it is open. <sup>a</sup> <sup>b</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **See the stage's panels** ("Draft Files", "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions", "Copyedited Files", "Participants"; Rule 1) | • Site Administrator (holding a journal role); Journal Manager; Editor: every submission<br>• Assigned Production editor, Section Editor, Guest Editor, Copyeditor, Marketing and sales coordinator: their assigned submissions<br>• Author, and Translator, Volume editor and Chapter Author alike: their own submission, in the author view, which shows "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions" and "Copyedited Files" only (Rule 11) <sup>a</sup> |
| **See the notice box** ("Assign a copyeditor using the Assign link in the Participants list." / "Awaiting Copyedits."; Rule 3) | • Assigned editors, on this stage, on a submission accepted from review, while the notice's condition holds; on a submission accepted without review no notice shows [A6](#a6). A Section Editor assigned through "Assign" after the acceptance, with participation limited to recommendations, read no notice while the Editor beside them read "Assign a copyeditor…" ⚠ [A11](#a11)<br>• A Journal Manager or Editor who is not assigned to the submission: no notice, although the panels show<br>• Copyeditor and the other assistants; Author: never <sup>d</sup> |
| **Add to and manage "Draft Files"** ("Upload/Select Files" above the list; "Update File Details", "More Information" and "Delete" in a row's menu; Rules 4–5) | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager; Editor: every submission<br>• Assigned Section Editor, Guest Editor, Copyeditor and the other assistants who reach the stage: their assigned submissions<br>• Author: never; the list is not shown in the author view (Rule 11) <sup>e</sup> |
| **Add to and manage "Copyedited Files"** (the same controls; Rule 6) | • The same roles as the row above<br>• Author: reads the list only: no "Upload/Select Files", no row menu (Rule 11) <sup>f</sup> |
| **"Send to Text Editor"** (a row-menu entry on both lists, for a Word, OpenDocument, RTF, LaTeX or Markdown file) | • Site Administrator; Journal Manager. It opens the window "Send File to Text Editor", which belongs to *Submission files* <sup>n</sup> |
| **Record "Send To Production"** (Rule 8) | • [Deciding editors](GLOSSARY.md#roles-and-access), while Copyediting is the active stage<br>• Recommending editors: no decision buttons and no recommendation controls on this stage ⚠ [A5](#a5)<br>• Copyeditor and the other assistants; Author: never <sup>c</sup> |
| **Record "Move to Review"** (Rule 9) | • The same deciding editors, at the same time; the button reads "Move to Review" whatever stage it leads to [A1](#a1) <sup>c</sup> |
| **Assign a participant** ("Assign" on the Participants panel) | • Owned by *Stage participants*. On this stage the "Assign" form offers the roles whose stage set includes Copyediting, Copyeditor among them, but never Journal Manager, although that role holds every stage; its "Choose a predefined message" list reads "Discussion (Copyediting)" and "Request Copyedit", and the latter is what raises the Copyeditor's task and email (Side effects). "Cancel" after a user is chosen closes the form and assigns nobody <sup>j</sup> |
| **Open or answer a discussion** ("Copyediting Tasks & Discussions") | • Owned by *Tasks & discussions*. The panel is shown to every role that opens the stage, the Author included (Rules 1, 11) <sup>a</sup> |

## Fields & validation

N/A. The Copyediting stage's own surfaces are panels, notices and buttons;
the forms they open belong to the features Purpose names (this spec says
what the "Upload/Select Files" window lists, Rule 5). <sup>q</sup>

## Rules & state

<a id="panels"></a>
1. **What the screen shows.** When a submission at Copyediting is opened at
   that stage, the editorial view shows, top to bottom: the notice box when
   one applies (Rule 3); the **"Draft Files"** list, described under its
   heading as "These are files from the review stage which are to be
   copyedited"; the **"Copyediting Tasks & Discussions"** panel; and the
   **"Copyedited Files"** list, described as "These are edited files that
   will be taken to the production stage". The **"Participants"** panel
   stands in the right-hand column. The decision buttons sit at the top of
   the screen: "Send To Production", highlighted, then "Move to Review"
   (Rules 8–9). Neither a journal nor a press shows a "Schedule For
   Publication" shortcut on this stage (both carry one on Production, a
   journal on Submission too); the publication pages are reached from the
   workflow's side menu instead. The header's "Preview" button while the
   submission sits here is
   [→ the header buttons](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-label).
   <sup>a</sup> <sup>m</sup>
<a id="arrival"></a>
2. **How a submission arrives.** A submission reaches Copyediting through
   "Accept Submission" on the review stage or "Accept and Skip Review" on
   the Submission stage (see *Review stage & rounds*, *[Submission
   stage](U25-submission-stage.md#send-to-review)*). The files ticked on
   that decision's "Select Files" page appear in "Draft Files" (Rule 4):
   "Accept Submission" offers the round's "Revisions" alone (a file in
   "Files for Review" is not offered, so with no revision uploaded "Draft
   Files" starts empty), "Accept and Skip Review" offers the "Submission
   Files". The stage bubble under the title reads "Copyediting", and no
   status box is shown while the submission is active here
   ([→ the status box](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#status-box)).
   On a submission accepted from review the notice box of Rule 3 takes that
   slot; after "Accept and Skip Review" nothing does [A6](#a6). <sup>g</sup>
<a id="notices"></a>
3. **The notice box.** Above "Draft Files", an assigned editor (Actors)
   sees one framed notice or none, on a submission that was accepted from
   review. The notice follows the "Assign" form and the file lists as they
   change; a discussion added from the panel below is read the next time
   the workflow is opened: <sup>d</sup>
   - 3a. **"Assign a copyeditor using the Assign link in the Participants
     list."** while no discussion exists on this stage and no file has been
     added to "Copyedited Files". A submission accepted with "Accept and
     Skip Review" shows its assigned editors no notice at all, not on
     landing and not after a further editor is assigned through "Assign"
     ⚠ [A6](#a6).
   - 3b. **"Awaiting Copyedits."** once a discussion exists on this stage
     (the "Assign" form's message opens one, whichever predefined message
     was chosen) and "Copyedited Files" is still empty. The notice follows
     the discussion, not the assignment: a Copyeditor assigned with no
     predefined message chosen and the message box left empty leaves 3a
     standing, and a discussion opened with no Copyeditor assigned flips it
     to 3b ⚠ [A3](#a3).
   - 3c. **No notice** once "Copyedited Files" holds at least one file, or
     once the submission has left the stage (Rule 10). Deleting the last
     copyedited file brings no notice back, on the same page or when the
     workflow is opened again ⚠ [A7](#a7).
   The notice is the editor's own: a Journal Manager who is not assigned to
   the submission sees the panels with no notice. <sup>d</sup>
<a id="draft-files"></a>
4. **"Draft Files".** The list holds the files to be copyedited. Each row
   shows the file's number ("No"), "File Name", "Date uploaded" and "Type",
   and, for the roles Actors names, a row menu ("More Actions") offering
   "Update File Details", "More Information" and "Delete"; "Delete" asks
   "Are you sure you wish to delete this item? This action cannot be
   undone." in a "Delete" dialog with "OK" and "Cancel". The file name is a
   link that downloads the file. "Upload/Select Files" above the list opens
   the window of Rule 5. Uploading a file here changes no notice (Rule 3).
   <sup>e</sup>
<a id="select-window"></a>
5. **The "Upload/Select Files" window.** Pressing "Upload/Select Files" on
   "Draft Files" opens a window titled "Upload/Select Files"; on "Copyedited
   Files" the same window opens titled "Upload Review File" ⚠ [A2](#a2).
   <sup>e</sup>
   - 5a. **What it lists.** The window opens on one group, "Copyediting",
     holding every file of the stage, the other list's files included, each
     with a tick box in a "Select" column. Every box opens clear, a row just
     uploaded (Rule 5b) or copied in (Rule 5c) included; only a listed file
     whose own box was ticked and saved opens ticked from then on. Ticking "Show files from
     all accessible workflow stages." regroups the files under the stages
     the reader may open.
   - 5b. **Uploading.** "Upload File" at the top opens the upload wizard,
     titled "Upload File" on "Draft Files" and "Upload Copyedited File" on
     "Copyedited Files", with the steps "1. Upload File", "2. Review
     Details", "3. Confirm" and "Complete". The new file then appears as a
     row in the window with its box clear; it joins the list when that box
     is ticked and the window is saved with "OK", and saving with the box
     clear leaves the list as it was. Leaving either unsaved asks nothing:
     the window's "Cancel" drops a tick, the wizard's "Cancel" leaves the
     list as it was.
   - 5c. **Ticking and clearing.** Ticking a file not yet in the list, from
     another stage or from the stage's other list, and pressing "OK" copies
     it in as a new row whose "No" differs from the source's; the source
     stays where it was. Clearing a box and saving removes nothing: a file
     leaves the list only through its row menu's "Delete" (Rule 4). Deleting
     a copyedited file took the copy of it in "Draft Files" with it, with no
     word of that in the "Delete" dialog ⚠ [A8](#a8).
<a id="copyedited-files"></a>
6. **"Copyedited Files".** The list holds the copyedited versions. It offers
   the same columns, row menu and "Upload/Select Files" as "Draft Files"
   (Rules 4–5) to the roles Actors names. The Author sees the rows and
   nothing to press (Rule 11). The first file added here clears the notice
   box (Rule 3c) and is counted on the author's My Submissions list
   ("Copyedited Files Uploaded: {count}", *[My
   Submissions](U22-my-submissions.md)*); the count follows the rows, a
   file copied in from "Draft Files" included. <sup>f</sup>
7. **Discussions and participants on this stage.** "Copyediting Tasks &
   Discussions" and "Participants" are the stage's instances of the shared
   discussions and participants panels and work as their own features
   describe (*Tasks & discussions*, *Stage participants*). What is this
   stage's: the discussions
   panel is shown in both views (Rule 11); the "Assign" form offers the
   roles whose stage set includes Copyediting, Journal Manager excepted, with
   the two predefined messages Actors names; and a discussion opened here
   drives the notice box (Rule 3). <sup>a</sup> <sup>j</sup>
<a id="send-to-production"></a>
8. **"Send To Production".** Pressing it opens the decision wizard with two
   pages: "Notify Authors", an email to the submission's authors that can be
   skipped, and "Select Files", headed "Select files that should be sent to
   the production stage.", which lists the "Copyedited" files, all ticked,
   and the "Draft Files", none ticked. Recording the decision moves the
   submission to the Production stage: the bubble reads "Production", the
   ticked files appear in Production's "Production Ready Files" list (*Production
   stage*), and the wizard closes on "Sent to Production" with the message
   "The submission, {title}, was sent to the production stage. The author
   has been notified, unless you chose to skip that email." The notices of
   Rule 3 are removed. <sup>g</sup>
<a id="move-to-review"></a>
9. **"Move to Review".** Pressing it opens the wizard with the "Notify
   Authors" page alone. Recording the decision closes it on "Sent Back from
   Copyediting" with "The submission, {title}, was sent back from the
   copyediting stage. The author has been notified, unless you chose to skip
   that email." <sup>h</sup>
   - 9a. **Where it lands.** The submission goes back to where it came from:
     to the review stage, on its last round, when it has had a review round
     (on a press, to External Review if it ever had an external round,
     otherwise to Internal Review [OMP1](#omp1)). The round's status box
     then reads by the round's reviewers, as *[Review stage &
     rounds](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#round-status)* describes
     ("Waiting for reviewers to be assigned." when none is on the round);
     the return itself is not announced there. A submission that was
     accepted without review goes back to the Submission stage, although
     the button and its email speak of review ⚠ [A1](#a1).
   - 9b. **The files.** They are kept but hidden: until the submission is
     accepted again, its "Copyediting" entry shows "The Copyediting stage
     has not yet been initiated." above the Participants panel. The next
     acceptance brings both lists back with the earlier files, and the
     files ticked on its "Select Files" page join "Draft Files" beside them.
10. **No decision off the active stage.** The two buttons appear only while
    Copyediting is the submission's active stage. Once the submission has
    moved on, its "Copyediting" entry shows the two file lists and a
    discussions panel under the status box "The submission is currently in
    the Production stage.", with no buttons and no notice. That panel is
    headed "Production Tasks & Discussions", not "Copyediting Tasks &
    Discussions" as in Rule 1 ⚠ [A12](#a12). <sup>c</sup>
<a id="author-view"></a>
11. **The author's view.** An Author opening their own submission at
    Copyediting sees the "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions" panel and, under
    it, the "Copyedited Files" list (with the line under its heading that
    Rule 1 quotes), its rows and no controls: no "Upload/Select Files", no
    row menu. There is no "Draft Files" list, no "Participants" panel, no
    notice box and no decision button. Before the submission reaches
    Copyediting the same entry shows only the box "The Copyediting stage has
    not yet been initiated." <sup>i</sup>

    That box is [→ the status box](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#status-box);
    the author's entry route (View on My Submissions) is *[My
    Submissions](U22-my-submissions.md)*'s. <sup>q</sup>
12. **The old author-dashboard address forwards.** An old author-dashboard
    bookmark (`…/authorDashboard/submission/<number>`) forwards the
    submission's own Author to the workflow panel on My Submissions; its
    former "Copyediting" tab is never shown. <sup>l</sup>

    The forward and its refusals are
    [→ workflow addresses](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#workflow-addresses).
    <sup>q</sup>

## Side effects

- **On "Send To Production".** The authors receive the email "Next steps for
  publishing your submission" unless the editor skipped it on the "Notify
  Authors" page; the Activity Log gains "{editor} sent this submission to the
  production stage."; the ticked files are copied into "Production Ready
  Files" (Rule 8). The wizard's own mechanics are *Editorial decision
  recording*'s. <sup>g</sup> <sup>o</sup>
- **On "Move to Review".** The authors receive the email "Your submission
  has been moved to review" unless skipped; the Activity Log gains "{editor}
  has sent this submission back from the copyediting stage.", under the name
  of whoever pressed the button (Rule 9). <sup>h</sup>
- **On assigning a Copyeditor with the "Request Copyedit" message.** The
  Copyeditor receives the email "Request Copyedit" from the assigning editor
  (its body opens "A new submission is ready to be copyedited: {number} —
  "{title}"", lists the steps to follow and ends with a reply link into the
  discussion) and two rows in the header's Tasks panel (*Notifications
  center*): "{editor} started a discussion: Request Copyedit: …" and the task
  "You have been asked to review copyedits for "{title}"." The task is not
  cleared by any later action on this stage; the Copyeditor removes it with
  the panel's "Delete", and the discussion row stays ⚠ [A4](#a4). A
  Copyeditor assigned with the message box left empty receives no email.
  The message also
  opens the discussion that flips the notice box (Rule 3b); the discussions
  panel lists that discussion as created by the Copyeditor, not by the
  editor who sent it ⚠ [A9](#a9). <sup>j</sup>
- **On adding or removing a copyedited file.** On adding, the notice box of
  every assigned editor changes to match (Rule 3); on removing the last one
  it does not [A7](#a7). The author's My Submissions cell counts the files either
  way (Rule 6). <sup>d</sup> <sup>f</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

- **"Stage Assignment"** (Settings › Users & Roles › Roles › a role's "Edit"
  form, the stage tick boxes; the Journal Manager row has no "Edit" and
  holds every stage). The install default gives Copyediting to Editor,
  Production editor, Section Editor, Guest Editor, Copyeditor, Marketing and
  sales coordinator, Author and Translator, and on a press to Volume editor
  and Chapter Author too; Layout Editor, Proofreader, Funding Coordinator,
  Reviewer and Reader have it unticked. With Copyediting ticked, an assigned
  member of the role reaches the stage's panels (Actors) and the role is
  offered in this stage's "Assign" form; unticked, an assigned member gets
  the no-access box here
  ([→ stage gate](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-gate)) and
  the role is not offered. Unticking a role's only remaining stage answers
  "Your changes have been saved." but the box is ticked again when the form
  is reopened; unticking one stage while ticking another saves
  ⚠ [A10](#a10). The form itself is *Roles configuration*'s. <sup>b</sup>
- **The email templates** "Sent to Production" and "Submission Sent Back
  from Copyediting" (Settings › Workflow › Emails; *Emails management*). The
  install defaults carry the subjects Side effects quotes; an edited subject
  or body is what the "Notify Authors" page prefills. <sup>p</sup>
- **The task template** "Request Copyedit" (Settings › Workflow › Tasks and
  Discussions, under "Copyediting Stage"; *Tasks & discussions*). Its
  Discussion body is what the "Assign" form's "Request Copyedit" message
  prefills, and its name is the subject of the Copyeditor's email (Side
  effects). <sup>p</sup>
- **The app's workflow stages.** A preprint server ships a single-stage
  workflow, which is why its submissions never occupy a Copyediting stage
  [OPS1](#ops1). This is a fixed property of each application, not a
  configurable setting. <sup>k</sup>

## Cross-feature interactions

- **[Workflow screen & stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-access)**:
  who may open a submission's workflow and reach this stage; the stage
  bubble, the "Preview" header button, the status box and the no-access
  box. This spec owns only what the Copyediting stage offers once opened.
  <sup>q</sup>
- **Editorial decision recording**: the wizard behind "Send To Production"
  and "Move to Review" (Rules 8–9). This spec owns the buttons' presence and
  the stage change each decision makes. <sup>q</sup>
- **[Review stage & rounds](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#decisions)**:
  "Accept Submission", the usual way in (Rule 2), and the destination of
  "Move to Review" with its round status (Rule 9a). <sup>q</sup>
- **[Submission stage](U25-submission-stage.md#send-to-review)**: "Accept and
  Skip Review", the other way in (Rule 2), and the destination of "Move to
  Review" for a submission never reviewed (Rule 9a). <sup>q</sup>
- **Production stage**: the destination of "Send To Production" and its
  "Production Ready Files" list (Rule 8). <sup>q</sup>
- **Submission files**: the two lists' upload wizard, "Update File Details",
  "More Information", "Delete" and "Send to Text Editor" (Rules 4–6).
  <sup>q</sup>
- **Stage participants**: the "Participants" panel and its "Assign" form,
  whose "Request Copyedit" message raises the Copyeditor's task (Rule 7;
  Side effects). <sup>q</sup>
- **Tasks & discussions**: the "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions" panel
  (Rule 7) and the task template "Request Copyedit" (Settings). <sup>q</sup>
- **[Notifications center](U05-notifications-center-and-email-preferences.md)**:
  the Tasks panel where the Copyeditor's two rows are listed (Side effects).
  <sup>q</sup>
- **[My Submissions](U22-my-submissions.md)**: the author's entry route
  (Rule 11) and the "Copyedited Files Uploaded: {count}" cell (Rule 6).
  <sup>q</sup>
- **Submission activity log & notes**: the log lines Side effects names.
  <sup>q</sup>
- **Emails management**: the two email templates (Settings). <sup>q</sup>
- **Roles configuration**: the Roles "Edit" form and its "Stage Assignment"
  boxes (Settings). <sup>q</sup>

## Canonical scenarios

Scenarios 3, 6 and 7 run on a scratch journal with throwaway accounts, since
each reads a mailbox; every other scenario runs on the seeded journal with
ready accounts and scratch submissions. A preprint server has no Copyediting
stage, so only scenario 10, its absence scenario, runs there; the accounts,
their passwords, the mail catcher's address and the tooling recipe are in
the footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **Open a submission at Copyediting** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Editor, on the dashboard, assigned to a submission accepted from
   review that sits at Copyediting with no file in either list, and on the
   same submission a Journal Manager who is not assigned and a Section
   Editor whose participation is limited to recommendations.

   - **The Copyediting stage**: open the submission's workflow at its
     "Copyediting" entry: the stage bubble under the title reads
     "Copyediting"; the main column shows, top to bottom, the notice box
     "Assign a copyeditor using the Assign link in the Participants list.",
     the "Draft Files" list described under its heading as "These are files
     from the review stage which are to be copyedited", the "Copyediting
     Tasks & Discussions" panel and the "Copyedited Files" list described as
     "These are edited files that will be taken to the production stage";
     the "Participants" panel stands in the right-hand column (Rules 1, 2,
     3a).
   - **The decision buttons**: at the top of the screen, "Send To
     Production", highlighted, then "Move to Review"; no "Schedule For
     Publication" shortcut (Rule 1).
   - **The Journal Manager not assigned**: opens the same submission at
     "Copyediting": the same four panels and both buttons, and no notice
     box (Rule 3; Actors row 2).
   - **The recommending Section Editor**: opens the same submission at
     "Copyediting": the same four panels, with "Assign" on the
     "Participants" panel; no "Send To Production", no "Move to Review",
     and no "Recommend Revisions", "Recommend Accept" or "Recommend
     Decline" control [A5](#a5) (Actors row 6). Whether the notice box
     shows to them is open [A11](#a11) (Actors row 2).
   - **Control**: no status box sits above "Draft Files": the notice box
     takes that slot while the submission is active here (Rule 2).

2. **Accept a submission with its revision** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Editor, on the review round of a submission in review ("External
   Review" on a press), the round holding one file in "Files for Review" and
   one revision uploaded on the round.

   - **"Accept Submission"**: press it; on the wizard's "Select Files" page
     the revision is offered under "Revisions" and the file in "Files for
     Review" is not; tick the revision and complete the wizard: the stage
     bubble reads "Copyediting" and "Draft Files" lists the revision with
     its "No", "File Name", "Date uploaded" and "Type" (Rules 2, 4).
   - **The notice**: above "Draft Files" the notice box reads "Assign a
     copyeditor using the Assign link in the Participants list." (Rules 2,
     3a).
   - **The file's name**: press it: the file downloads (Rule 4).
   - **Control**: the file in "Files for Review" is not listed in "Draft
     Files" (Rule 2).

3. **Assign a Copyeditor with "Request Copyedit"** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Editor, on a scratch journal, assigned to a submission accepted
   from review at Copyediting, with two Copyeditors of the journal not yet
   assigned to it.

   - **"Assign"**: on the "Participants" panel press "Assign", choose the
     first Copyeditor, choose "Request Copyedit" in "Choose a predefined
     message" and complete the form: the notice box above "Draft Files"
     reads "Awaiting Copyedits.", and the "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions"
     panel lists a discussion "Request Copyedit", shown as created by the
     Copyeditor [A9](#a9) (Rule 3b; Side effects).
   - **The Copyeditor's mailbox**: holds the email "Request Copyedit" from
     the assigning editor; its body opens "A new submission is ready to be
     copyedited: {number} — "{title}"", lists the steps to follow and ends
     with a reply link into the discussion (Side effects).
   - **The Copyeditor's Tasks panel**: Copyeditor: sign in and open the
     header's Tasks panel: two rows, "{editor} started a discussion: Request
     Copyedit: …" and "You have been asked to review copyedits for
     "{title}"."; press the panel's "Delete" on the task: the task row is
     gone and the discussion row stays [A4](#a4) (Side effects).
   - **Control**: the second Copyeditor, assigned on the same submission
     through "Assign" with no predefined message chosen and the message box
     left empty, receives no email (Side effects).

4. **The Copyeditor uploads the copyedited file** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Copyeditor, assigned without a message to a submission accepted
   from review at Copyediting, with an Editor assigned to it and no file in
   either list.

   - **The Editor's notice before the upload**: Editor: open the submission
     at "Copyediting": the notice box reads "Assign a copyeditor using the
     Assign link in the Participants list.", the Copyeditor's assignment
     having opened no discussion [A3](#a3) (Rule 3b).
   - **The Copyeditor's screen**: Copyeditor: open the submission at
     "Copyediting": "Draft Files", "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions",
     "Copyedited Files" and "Participants", with "Upload/Select Files" above
     each list; no notice box, no "Send To Production" and no "Move to
     Review" (Actors rows 1–4, 6).
   - **"Upload/Select Files" on "Copyedited Files"**: press it: the window
     opens titled "Upload Review File" [A2](#a2); press "Upload File": the
     wizard is titled "Upload Copyedited File", with the steps "1. Upload
     File", "2. Review Details", "3. Confirm" and "Complete"; attach a file,
     finish the wizard, tick the new row in the window and press the
     window's "OK": the file is listed in "Copyedited Files" with its "No",
     "File Name", "Date uploaded" and "Type" (Rules 5b, 6).
   - **The Editor's screen after the upload**: Editor: open the submission
     at "Copyediting" again: no notice box above "Draft Files" (Rule 3c;
     Side effects).
   - **"Delete" on the copyedited file**: Copyeditor: in the file's row menu
     press "Delete": a "Delete" dialog asks "Are you sure you wish to delete
     this item? This action cannot be undone."; press "OK": the row is gone
     from "Copyedited Files"; no notice comes back for the Editor
     [A7](#a7) (Rules 4, 3c).
   - **Control**: the Editor's screen offers "Send To Production" and "Move
     to Review" before and after the upload, which the Copyeditor's never
     does (Actors row 6).

5. **The "Upload/Select Files" window on "Draft Files"** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Editor, on a submission at Copyediting whose "Copyedited Files"
   list holds one file and whose Submission stage holds one submission file,
   "Draft Files" being empty.

   - **The window**: press "Upload/Select Files" above "Draft Files": a
     window titled "Upload/Select Files" opens on one group, "Copyediting",
     listing the copyedited file with its box in the "Select" column clear
     (Rules 5, 5a).
   - **"Show files from all accessible workflow stages."**: tick it: the
     files regroup under the stages, and the Submission stage's file is
     listed under its stage (Rule 5a).
   - **A file from another stage**: tick the Submission stage's file and
     press "OK": "Draft Files" lists it as a new row whose "No" differs from
     the file's on the Submission stage; select "Submission" in the workflow
     menu: the Submission stage still lists the file (Rule 5c).
   - **"Upload File"**: press "Upload/Select Files" again, then "Upload
     File" at the top of the window: the wizard is titled "Upload File",
     with the steps "1. Upload File", "2. Review Details", "3. Confirm" and
     "Complete"; attach a file, finish the wizard, tick the new row in the
     window and press "OK": the new file joins "Draft Files" (Rule 5b).
   - **Control**: open the window once more, tick the copyedited file and
     press the window's "Cancel": the window closes without a question, and
     "Draft Files" lists the same rows as before (Rules 5b, 5c).

6. **"Send To Production"** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Editor, on a scratch journal, with a submission at Copyediting
   holding one file in "Draft Files" and one in "Copyedited Files", its
   Author holding an account on the journal.

   - **The wizard**: press "Send To Production": the wizard opens on "Notify
     Authors", an email to the submission's authors; continue to "Select
     Files", headed "Select files that should be sent to the production
     stage.": the "Copyedited" file is ticked and the "Draft Files" file is
     not; record the decision: the wizard closes on "Sent to Production"
     with "The submission, {title}, was sent to the production stage. The
     author has been notified, unless you chose to skip that email.", and
     the stage bubble reads "Production" (Rule 8).
   - **"Production Ready Files"**: on the Production stage the list holds
     the copyedited file and not the draft file (Rule 8; Side effects).
   - **The "Copyediting" entry after the move**: select "Copyediting" in the
     workflow menu: the two file lists and a discussions panel, headed
     "Production Tasks & Discussions" [A12](#a12), show under the status
     box "The submission is currently in the Production stage.", with no
     decision buttons and no notice (Rule 10).
   - **The Author's mailbox**: holds the email "Next steps for publishing
     your submission" (Side effects).
   - **Control**: before the decision the same "Copyediting" entry offered
     "Send To Production" and "Move to Review" and showed no status box
     (Rules 1, 2).

7. **"Move to Review" after a review round** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Editor, on a scratch journal, with a submission accepted from its
   Round 1 at Copyediting, the round holding no reviewer, and one file in
   "Draft Files".

   - **The wizard**: press "Move to Review": the wizard opens with the
     "Notify Authors" page alone; record the decision: it closes on "Sent
     Back from Copyediting" with "The submission, {title}, was sent back
     from the copyediting stage. The author has been notified, unless you
     chose to skip that email." (Rule 9).
   - **Where it lands**: the workflow shows the review stage on Round 1
     ("External Review" on a press [OMP1](#omp1)), its status box reading
     "Waiting for reviewers to be assigned." (Rule 9a).
   - **The "Copyediting" entry**: select it in the workflow menu: "The
     Copyediting stage has not yet been initiated." above the
     "Participants" panel, and no file list (Rule 9b).
   - **The Author's mailbox**: holds the email "Your submission has been
     moved to review" (Side effects).
   - **Control**: before the decision the "Copyediting" entry listed the
     file in "Draft Files" and offered both buttons (Rules 1, 4).

8. **The author's view** {OJS OMP}

   Given: Author, on My Submissions, with their own submission at
   Copyediting whose "Copyedited Files" holds one file.

   - **The Copyediting stage**: open the submission's workflow at its
     "Copyediting" entry: the "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions" panel and,
     under it, the "Copyedited Files" list described as "These are edited
     files that will be taken to the production stage", listing the file
     with nothing to press: no "Upload/Select Files" above it and no row
     menu (Rule 11; Actors row 4).
   - **What the view leaves out**: no "Draft Files" list, no "Participants"
     panel, no notice box, no "Send To Production" and no "Move to Review"
     (Rule 11).
   - **Control**: an Editor opening the same submission at "Copyediting"
     sees "Draft Files", the "Participants" panel, "Upload/Select Files"
     above "Copyedited Files" and both decision buttons (Rule 1; Actors
     rows 3, 4, 6).

App-specific:

9. **{OMP} "Move to Review" after an internal round only**

   Given: Press Editor, with a monograph accepted from its Internal Review
   round at Copyediting, the round holding no reviewer, and a second
   monograph that had an internal and then an external round before its
   acceptance, also at Copyediting.

   - **"Move to Review" on the first monograph**: press it and record the
     decision: the workflow shows "Internal Review" on Round 1, its status
     box reading "Waiting for reviewers to be assigned." [OMP1](#omp1)
     (Rule 9a).
   - **Control**: the second monograph, moved the same way, lands on
     "External Review" [OMP1](#omp1) (Rule 9a).

10. **{OPS} No Copyediting stage on a preprint server**

    Given: Preprint Server Manager, with a submitted preprint.

    - **The workflow menu**: open the preprint's workflow: the menu lists
      "Production" alone; no "Copyediting" entry [OPS1](#ops1).
    - **The decision buttons**: the Production stage offers "Post the
      preprint" and "Decline Submission"; neither "Send To Production" nor
      "Move to Review" appears anywhere on the screen [OPS1](#ops1).
    - **The "Assign" form**: on the "Participants" panel press "Assign":
      "Choose a predefined message" lists "Discussion (Production)" and
      "Assign Editor", and no "Request Copyedit" or "Discussion
      (Copyediting)"; no Copyeditor is among the roles offered
      [OPS1](#ops1).
    - **The Roles screen**: Settings › Users & Roles › Roles lists Preprint
      Server Manager, Moderator, Author, Reader and Editorial Board Member,
      and no Copyeditor [OPS1](#ops1).
    - **Control**: "Production" in the menu, "Post the preprint" at the top,
      "Assign Editor" in the message list and Moderator on the Roles screen
      are present, so each screen that shows an absence is working
      [OPS1](#ops1).

## Coverage

Left out of the scenarios above, by reason:

- **Budget** — states:
  - both lists back with their earlier files after a second acceptance, the newly ticked files joining "Draft Files" beside them (Rule 9b): accepting again a submission moved back to review is not an ordinary week's action; scenario 7 stops at the hidden "Copyediting" entry
  - "Stage Assignment" changed on the Roles form, Copyediting unticked for Copyeditor and ticked for Layout Editor (Settings bullet 1): a manager changes a role's stages rarely, not in an ordinary week
- **Nothing new to test**:
  - an assigned Section Editor, Guest Editor, Production editor or Site Administrator opening the stage (Actors preamble, rows 1, 6): the panels, notice and buttons scenario 1 reads as the Editor
  - Marketing and sales coordinator assigned here (Actors row 1): the panels and lists scenario 4 reads as the Copyeditor
  - Translator, Volume editor or Chapter Author on their own submission (Actors preamble, row 1): the author view scenario 8 reads as the Author
- **Register carries it**:
  - A6 (no notice on a submission accepted without review; Rules 2, 3a)
  - A3 (the notice flips on a discussion, not on the assignment; Rule 3b; scenario 4 marks it)
  - A7 (no notice back after the last copyedited file is deleted; Rule 3c; scenario 4 marks it)
  - A8 (deleting a copyedited file took its "Draft Files" copy with it; Rule 5c)
  - A2 (the "Copyedited Files" window titled "Upload Review File"; Rule 5; scenario 4 marks it)
  - A1 ("Move to Review" on a never-reviewed submission landing on the Submission stage; Rule 9a)
  - A4 (the Copyeditor's task not cleared by the copyedits; Side effects; scenario 3 marks it)
  - A9 (the message's discussion listed under the Copyeditor's name; Side effects; scenario 3 marks it)
  - A10 (a role's only stage unticked: "saved", still ticked; Settings bullet 1)
  - A11 (no notice for a recommending Section Editor assigned through "Assign" after the acceptance; Actors row 2; scenario 1 marks it)
  - A12 (the "Copyediting" entry's discussions panel headed "Production Tasks & Discussions" after the move; Rule 10; scenario 6 marks it)
- **Owned by another feature**:
  - a Copyeditor assigned to a submission still in Review: the no-access box (Actors preamble; *Workflow screen & stage access*, scenario 3)
  - the author's "The Copyediting stage has not yet been initiated." before the stage is reached (Rule 11; *Workflow screen & stage access*, scenario 3)
  - "Send to Text Editor" for a Journal Manager (Actors row 5; *Submission files*)
  - clearing a listed file's box removing nothing (Rules 4, 5c; *Submission files*)
  - the row menu's "Update File Details", "More Information" and "Delete" windows (Rule 4; *Submission files*)
  - "Notify Authors" skipped: no email (Rule 8; Side effects; *Editorial decision recording*)
  - the Activity Log lines of both decisions (Side effects; *Submission activity log & notes*)
  - the "Assign" form's roles, Journal Manager absent, and "Cancel" assigning nobody (Actors row 8; *Stage participants*)
  - "Copyedited Files Uploaded: {count}" on My Submissions (Rule 6; *My Submissions*, scenario 3)
  - an edited email template prefilling "Notify Authors" and an edited task template prefilling the "Assign" message (Settings bullets 2–3; *Emails management*, *Tasks & discussions*)

### All apps

<a id="a1"></a>
**A1 — "Move to Review" lands on the Submission stage for a submission never reviewed** · ❓ · user-visible.
A deciding editor who accepted a submission with "Accept and Skip Review"
and now presses "Move to Review" expects the submission in review. It goes
back to the Submission stage instead, because there is no review round to
return to, while the button, the wizard's own page ("their submission will
undergo further editorial review") and the author's email ("Your submission
has been moved to review", "It will undergo further review before it can be
accepted") all say review. Nothing is lost: the Submission stage offers its
decisions again.
Question: should the button and its email follow the destination (a
"Move to Submission" wording when no round exists), or should the decision
open a review round? Lean: follow the destination in the wording; the
mechanism is deliberate, the words are not.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a1](#fn-a1)</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — The "Copyedited Files" window is titled "Upload Review File"** · 🐞 · minor.
"Upload/Select Files" on "Copyedited Files" opens the file-selection window
under the title "Upload Review File", a title from the review stage; the
same button on "Draft Files" opens it as "Upload/Select Files". The window
works, and the upload wizard inside it is titled "Upload Copyedited File"
with the heading "Copyedited"; only the outer title is wrong.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a2](#fn-a2)</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — The notice reads the discussions, not the participants** · ❓ · minor.
The notice box tells an editor to assign a copyeditor until a discussion
exists on this stage, and reads "Awaiting Copyedits." from then on. The
"Assign" form's message opens such a discussion, whichever predefined
message is chosen, so the ordinary assignment flips the notice as expected.
But an editor who assigns a Copyeditor with the message box left empty
keeps reading "Assign a copyeditor…", and any discussion opened on this
stage, with no Copyeditor assigned, reads "Awaiting Copyedits.".
Question: should the notice read the Participants panel (a Copyeditor
assigned) rather than the discussions? Lean: yes; the notice names the
Participants list as its condition.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a3](#fn-a3)</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — The Copyeditor's task outlives the copyedits** · ❓ · minor.
The "Request Copyedit" message puts "You have been asked to review copyedits
for "{title}"." into the Copyeditor's Tasks panel. Uploading the copyedited
files, and even "Send To Production", leave the task there; only the
Copyeditor's own "Delete" in the panel removes it, and the discussion row
the same message created stays beside it. The layout and index requests of
the Production stage have completion emails that clear theirs; copyediting
has none.
Question: should the first copyedited file, or "Send To Production", clear
the task? Lean: clear it on "Send To Production", when the copyedits are
accepted.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a4](#fn-a4)</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — A recommend-only editor has nothing to do on Copyediting** · ❓ · minor.
An editor whose participation is limited to recommendations gets dedicated
"Recommend Revisions", "Recommend Accept" and "Recommend Decline" controls
on the review stage while a deciding editor is assigned beside them. On
Copyediting they get nothing: the panels show, "Assign" is offered, and no
decision button or recommendation control appears, with or without a
deciding editor beside them, so they cannot send the submission on, move it
back, or recommend either.
Question: is that intended, or should a recommendation be possible here as on
review? Lean: intended; there is no decision to recommend at this stage
short of the move itself, and a deciding editor is always assigned above
them.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a5](#fn-a5)</sup>

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — No notice on a submission accepted without review** · 🐞 · minor.
An assigned editor opening a submission that reached Copyediting through
"Accept and Skip Review" expects "Assign a copyeditor using the Assign link
in the Participants list.", as on a submission accepted from review. No
notice shows: not on landing, and not after a further editor is assigned
through "Assign". The same editors read the notice on a submission accepted
from review. Whether a message sent from "Assign" brings "Awaiting
Copyedits." on this path was not seen.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a6](#fn-a6)</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — The notice does not return when the last copyedited file is deleted** · 🐞 · minor.
An editor who deletes the only file in "Copyedited Files" expects the notice
they read before it was added ("Assign a copyeditor…" or "Awaiting
Copyedits.") to come back, since the list is empty again. No notice shows,
on the same page, when the workflow is opened again, or later. Adding a
copyedited file removes the notice as intended; only the removal is
one-sided.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a7](#fn-a7)</sup>

<a id="a8"></a>
**A8 — Deleting a copyedited file removed its copy in "Draft Files"** · ❓ · minor.
A manager copied a copyedited file into "Draft Files" through the
"Upload/Select Files" window (Rule 5c), then deleted the original from
"Copyedited Files" with its row menu's "Delete". The copy in "Draft Files"
went with it, although the "Delete" dialog ("Are you sure you wish to delete
this item? This action cannot be undone.") speaks of one item. Seen once per
app, in that direction only.
Question: is a copied file meant to share its fate with its source? Lean: a
defect, minor; the dialog promises one deletion and the copy's row shows
nothing of the link. What would settle it: copy a draft file into
"Copyedited Files", delete the draft original, and record whether the copy
stays.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a8](#fn-a8)</sup>

<a id="a9"></a>
**A9 — The "Request Copyedit" discussion is listed under the Copyeditor's name** · 🐞 · minor.
The discussion the "Assign" form's message opens is listed on "Copyediting
Tasks & Discussions" as "Discussion Request Copyedit Created by: {the
Copyeditor's username}", with no "Discussion created by … on …" line,
although the editor wrote and sent it; the Copyeditor's own Tasks row says
"{editor} started a discussion: Request Copyedit: …". A discussion the
editor adds by hand from the panel names the editor in both places. The
panel is *Tasks & discussions*'; the form that sends the message is this
stage's.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a9](#fn-a9)</sup>

<a id="a10"></a>
**A10 — A role's last stage cannot be unticked, and the form says saved** · ❓ · minor.
On Settings › Users & Roles › Roles, a manager who opens a role's "Edit"
form, clears its only ticked box under "Stage Assignment" and saves reads
"Your changes have been saved."; the form, reopened, shows the box ticked
again. Clearing one stage while ticking another saves. The form is *Roles
configuration*'s.
Question: is a role meant to keep at least one stage, and if so should the
form say so instead of "saved"? Lean: the guard is intended, the message is
wrong.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-a10](#fn-a10)</sup>

<a id="a11"></a>
**A11 — No notice for a recommending editor assigned after the acceptance** · ❓ · minor.
A Section Editor assigned to the Copyediting stage through "Assign", after
the submission was accepted from review, with participation limited to
recommendations, expects the notice their fellow editors read. They open the
stage to the four panels and no notice, while the Editor already assigned
reads "Assign a copyeditor using the Assign link in the Participants list."
on the same submission. Seen once, on a press; a recommending Section Editor
on a journal read the notice, but was not assigned through "Assign".
Question: is the notice withheld because the editor was assigned through
"Assign" once the submission sat at Copyediting, or because their
participation is limited to recommendations? Lean: the assignment route,
since an editor assigned through "Assign" to a submission accepted without
review gets no notice either ([A6](#a6)); what settles it is a deciding
Section Editor assigned through the same form at this stage reading, or not
reading, the notice.
Basis: test run. <sup>[f-a11](#fn-a11)</sup>

<a id="a12"></a>
**A12 — The "Copyediting" entry's discussions panel takes the Production heading** · ❓ · minor.
An editor who selects "Copyediting" in the workflow menu after "Send To
Production" expects the panel between the two file lists to read
"Copyediting Tasks & Discussions", as it did while the submission sat here.
It reads "Production Tasks & Discussions": the heading follows the
submission's active stage, not the entry the editor opened. The lists and
the status box are the Copyediting entry's.
Question: is the panel shown there the Copyediting stage's discussions under
the wrong heading, or the Production stage's discussions on the wrong entry?
Lean: the heading alone is wrong; what settles it is a discussion added from
that panel and which stage's entry lists it.
Basis: test run. <sup>[f-a12](#fn-a12)</sup>

### OMP

<a id="omp1"></a>
**OMP1 — "Move to Review" on a press returns to the review stage the monograph last had** · ✅ · —.
A press has two review stages. "Move to Review" returns the monograph to
External Review when it ever had an external round, otherwise to Internal
Review when it had an internal round, and to Submission when it had neither
(the last case is [A1](#a1)). A journal, with one review stage, needs no such
choice. Intended: the press's two stages are the difference, not the
decision.
Basis: probe. <sup>[f-omp1](#fn-omp1)</sup>

### OPS

<a id="ops1"></a>
**OPS1 — A preprint server has no Copyediting stage** · ✅ · —.
A preprint server's workflow is a single stage, Production. Its workflow
menu lists "Production" alone (a typed Copyediting address lands on
Production), its Roles screen installs Preprint Server Manager, Moderator,
Author, Reader and Editorial Board Member and no Copyeditor, its "Assign"
form offers those three roles with the predefined messages "Discussion
(Production)" and "Assign Editor", and neither "Send To Production" nor
"Move to Review" exists anywhere on its screens. Intended: the application
ships that way.

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

Code read 2026-09-18 at the checkouts' tips (`checkouts/ojs`, `checkouts/omp`,
`checkouts/ops`, each with its `lib/pkp` and `lib/ui-library`). Every claim
was then driven on running OJS and OMP installs, with OPS as the control, on
2026-09-18 (the notice box, the file lists and window, the two decisions and
their mails) and 2026-09-19 (the screen by role, the settings screens, the
preprint server); each block below names what its drive covered.

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — The stage's panels: `lib/ui-library/src/pages/workflow/composables/useWorkflowConfig/workflowConfigEditorialOJS.js`, `WorkflowConfig[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING]`: `getPrimaryItems` pushes `WorkflowNotificationDisplay`, `FileManager` namespace `FINAL_DRAFT_FILES`, `DiscussionManager`, `FileManager` namespace `COPYEDITED_FILES`, in that order; `getSecondaryItems` pushes `ParticipantManager`. `useWorkflowConfigOMP.js` deep-merges `workflowConfigEditorialOMP.js` over the OJS config, and the OMP file defines no `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING` key of its own, so the press shows the OJS roster. Titles and descriptions from `useFileManagerConfig.js`: `FINAL_DRAFT_FILES` → `submission.finalDraft` "Draft Files" and `fileManager.draftFilesDescription`; `COPYEDITED_FILES` → `fileManager.copyeditedFiles` "Copyedited Files" and `fileManager.copyeditedFilesDescription`. The discussions heading is `getDiscussionTitleByStage()` in `managers/DiscussionManager/useDiscussionManagerHelpers.js` → `submission.queries.editorial` "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions". The `common.getPrimaryItems` guard shows `user.authorization.accessibleWorkflowStage` (the no-access box) when the stage is outside `permissions.accessibleStages`, which is U24's rule. Live-probed 2026-09-19 (Rule 1, Actors rows 1 and 9): the four panels in that order, both description lines verbatim and "Participants" on the right for every editorial account on OJS and OMP; "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions" with "Add" and "Copyedited Files" alone for the Author, Translator, Volume editor and Chapter Author; the no-access box for Layout Editor, Proofreader and Funding Coordinator.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — Stage sets: `registry/userGroups.xml`. OJS: manager (no `stages`, every stage), editor `1,3,4,5,6`, productionEditor `4,5,6`, sectionEditor and guestEditor `1,3,4,5,6`, copyeditor `4`, marketing `4`, designer / indexer / layoutEditor / proofreader `5,6`, funding `1,3`, author and translator `1,3,4,5,6`, externalReviewer `3`, reader / subscriptionManager / editorialBoardMember none. OMP: the same with `2` (Internal Review) added to editor, sectionEditor, funding (`1,2,3`), author and translator; plus volumeEditor `1,2,3,4,5,6`, chapterAuthor `4,5,6`, internalReviewer `2`. Stage 4 is `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING`. Permission levels: `productionEditor` is declared with `roleId` `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` (the Roles grid's "Journal Manager" / "Press Manager"), which is why the role decides, assigns and reads the editors' notices; `translator`, `volumeEditor` and `chapterAuthor` are `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR`, refused by the editorial dashboard's `roleBasedAccessDenied` and served the author config. On-screen names: `default.groups.name.marketing` "Marketing and sales coordinator", `default.groups.name.productionEditor` "Production editor", `default.groups.name.volumeEditor` "Volume editor", `default.groups.name.chapterAuthor` "Chapter Author". The Roles form (`controllers/grid/settings/roles/form/UserGroupForm.php`) heads the boxes "Stage Assignment"; the manager row has no "Edit" because `RoleDAO::getAlwaysActiveStages()` gives `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` every stage. No passthrough key sets a role's stages (scenarios.md), so the other end is reached on the screen only. Live-probed 2026-09-19 (Actors preamble and row 1, Settings bullet 1): every default tick for every role with an "Edit" on OJS and OMP; Copyediting unticked for Copyeditor → the assigned Copyeditor gets "You don't currently have access to that stage of the workflow." and the "Assign" form drops "Copyeditor"; ticked for Layout Editor → the panels and the role offered; the Production editor's notice, buttons and "Assign"; the three author-level roles refused on the editorial address and landing in the author view.

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — Decision roster: `classes/submission/maps/Schema.php::getAvailableEditorialDecisions()` in OJS and OMP, `case WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING: [new SendToProduction(), new BackFromCopyediting()]`, with no status branch (a submission cannot be declined here). Buttons: `workflowConfigEditorialOJS.js` `getActionItems` pushes `WorkflowActionButton` `editor.submission.decision.sendToProduction` ("Send To Production", `isPrimary`) and `editor.submission.decision.backFromCopyediting` ("Move to Review", `isWarnable`), each guarded by `isDecisionAvailable(submission, DECISION_*)`, which matches the submission's active stage, so the buttons vanish once it moves on (Rule 10). Permissions: `lib/pkp/classes/submission/maps/Schema.php::checkDecisionPermissions()`; an assistant never satisfies `canMakeDecision`; a recommend-only editor gets `canMakeDecision` only when `Repo::decision()->getDecisionTypesMadeByRecommendingUsers($stageId)` is non-empty, and both apps' `classes/decision/Repository.php` return an empty list for every stage but Submission, so the roster is empty for them here (A5). Live-probed 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-19 (Actors rows 6–7, Rule 10, A5): both buttons for the administrator, manager, Editor, assigned Section and Guest Editors and Production editor, none for the Copyeditor, the coordinator or the author; the recommend-only flag set on the Participants row menu's "Edit" › "Edit Assignment" ("This participant is only allowed to recommend an editorial decision…"), after which that Section Editor's Copyediting entry offers no decision button and no "Recommend…" control, with or without a deciding editor assigned beside them, while "Assign" stays; after "Send To Production" every level reads "The submission is currently in the Production stage." with the lists and no buttons.

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — The notice box is `WorkflowNotificationDisplay.vue`, which posts to `notification/fetchNotification` for the types `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_ASSIGN_COPYEDITOR` and `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_AWAITING_COPYEDITS` on `ASSOC_TYPE_SUBMISSION`; `PKPNotificationHandler::fetchNotification()` reads the signed-in user's own rows, so the box is per user. Texts: `notification.type.assignCopyeditors` "Assign a copyeditor using the Assign link in the Participants list." and `notification.type.awaitingCopyedits` "Awaiting Copyedits.". Rows are created and deleted by `PKPEditingProductionStatusNotificationManager::updateNotification()`, for each `StageAssignment` of the submission at its current stage with role `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` or `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR` (an unassigned manager has no row and sees nothing): at `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING`, with any `SUBMISSION_FILE_COPYEDIT` file both types are deleted; otherwise, with an `EditorialTask` at that stage (the code's comment: "a copyeditor is assigned i.e. there is a copyediting discussion") AWAITING is created and ASSIGN deleted, and with none ASSIGN is created and AWAITING deleted. The recomputation runs on a decision listed by `lib/pkp/classes/decision/Repository.php::getSubmissionNotificationTypes()`, which names `ACCEPT` and `SEND_TO_PRODUCTION` and not `SKIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW`, so a submission accepted without review never gets the pair computed (A6); on a participant added or removed (`StageParticipantGridHandler`); on the assign form's message (`PKPStageParticipantNotifyForm::execute()`); on a copyedited file added (`submissionFile/Repository.php`, `ManageCopyeditFilesGridHandler::updateCopyeditFiles()`) and on a task saved (`EditorialTaskController`). On a copyedited file deleted, `Repository::delete()` recomputes before `$this->dao->delete()` runs, so the manager still finds the file and deletes both types; nothing runs afterwards (A7). Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Rule 3, Side effects) and 2026-09-19 (Actors row 2): the box is a level-3 "Notification" heading and one paragraph between "Current Submission Language" and "Draft Files"; "Assign a copyeditor…" for every assigned editor on every submission accepted from review (five per app), none for the unassigned manager, the administrator, the Copyeditor or the author; the no-message assignment leaves 3a on the same page and re-landed; the "Request Copyedit" message and the "Discussion (Copyediting)" message both flip it to "Awaiting Copyedits." on the same page, for the editor not in the discussion too; a discussion added from the panel's "Add" leaves the same page unchanged and reads "Awaiting Copyedits." on the next opening; the first copyedited file removes it on the same page; deleting the only copyedited file brings none back (same page, re-landed, minutes later, from 3a and from 3b); after either decision no notice; on a submission seeded or moved by "Accept and Skip Review" no notice for the assigned Section Editor before or after a further editor is assigned through "Assign".

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — "Draft Files": `useFileManagerConfig.js` `FINAL_DRAFT_FILES`, `fileStage` `SUBMISSION_FILE_FINAL`, actions for `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR` / `MANAGER` / `SITE_ADMIN` / `ASSISTANT`: `FILE_LIST`, `FILE_SELECT_UPLOAD`, `FILE_EDIT`, `FILE_DELETE`, `FILE_SEE_NOTES`; no `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` entry, so the author's config never mounts it. Roles are matched by `useCurrentUser().hasCurrentUserAtLeastOneAssignedRoleInStage()` against `stage.currentUserAssignedRoles`, which `lib/pkp/classes/submission/maps/Schema.php` fills from the user's stage assignments, or from the global manager / site-admin role when the user is assigned in no role (so an unassigned Journal Manager gets the full controls). Columns from `getColumns()`: `common.numero` "No", `common.fileName` "File Name", `common.dateUploaded` "Date uploaded", `common.type` "Type", plus a screen-reader-only `common.moreActions` "More Actions" column; row menu from `getItemActions()`: `grid.action.updateFile` "Update File Details" (window "Edit a file"), `grid.action.moreInformation` "More Information" (window "Information Center: {file}"), `grid.action.delete` "Delete" (a `common.delete` dialog with `common.ok` / `common.cancel`). Top button `editor.submission.uploadSelectFiles` "Upload/Select Files" → `useFileManagerActions.fileSelectUpload()` opens the legacy grid `grid.files.final.FinalDraftFilesGridHandler` op `selectFiles`, whose `ManageFinalDraftFilesForm` renders the `ManageFinalDraftFilesGridHandler` grid (`SubmissionFilesCategoryGridDataProvider(SUBMISSION_FILE_FINAL)`); its categories are the stages in `ASSOC_TYPE_ACCESSIBLE_WORKFLOW_STAGES`, shown only once "Show files from all accessible workflow stages." is ticked. Save runs `ManageSubmissionFilesForm::execute()`: a ticked file not yet in the list is copied in by `importFile()` (a clone carrying `sourceSubmissionFileId`); a listed file's tick sets its `viewable` flag and a cleared box removes nothing. The window is *Submission files*' mechanism; the instantiation facts are here. Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Rules 4–5, Actors row 3): the columns, the row menu at every editorial level, the "Delete" dialog's sentence with OK and Cancel, the file-name download; the window opening on the single "Copyediting" group with the other list's files included and every box clear, a row just copied in included (only a listed file whose own box was ticked and saved shows ticked on later opens, and in that list's window alone), the stage groups after the box is ticked (OJS Submission / Review / Copyediting / Production; OMP with Internal and External Review; a Section Editor also "Done"; a Copyeditor "Copyediting" alone); the upload control rendered as the link "Upload File" (not the "Add a file" the code read expected) and the wizard's titles and steps; the Submission stage's file copied in as a new row with a new number while "Submission Files" kept the original; a copyedited file copied into "Draft Files" and a draft file into "Copyedited Files" the same way; every box cleared and saved removing nothing; the window's "Cancel" dropping a tick and the wizard's "Cancel" leaving "No Items", both without a dialog. Test runs 2026-09-19 on OJS and OMP (scenarios 4, 5, 6, 7; every upload of the runs): a file uploaded through the window's wizard appeared in the window's grid with its box clear and joined the list only once that box was ticked and the window saved with "OK"; saved with the box clear, the list stayed as it was.

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — "Copyedited Files": `useFileManagerConfig.js` `COPYEDITED_FILES`, `fileStage` `SUBMISSION_FILE_COPYEDIT`; `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` gets `FILE_LIST` alone (no top button, `getItemActions()` returns an empty list); the editorial roles the same set as `FINAL_DRAFT_FILES`. `uploadSelectTitleKey` is `editor.submissionReview.uploadFile` "Upload Review File" (A2); `gridComponent` `grid.files.copyedit.CopyeditFilesGridHandler` op `selectFiles` → `ManageCopyeditFilesGridHandler`, whose `updateCopyeditFiles()` recomputes the notices (note d). Server side the author may read copyedit files: `lib/pkp/classes/submissionFile/Repository.php::getAssignedFileStages()` adds `SUBMISSION_FILE_COPYEDIT` for an author assignment at `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING` with `SUBMISSION_FILE_ACCESS_READ` and never `SUBMISSION_FILE_FINAL`; `PKPSubmissionFileController::getMany()` filters the listing by that set. The My Submissions cell is *My Submissions*' rule 7c. Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Rule 6, Rule 11, Actors row 4): the same columns and row menu as "Draft Files" at every editorial level; the author's rows carrying the file-name link only, which downloads the file, and no "More Actions" or "Upload/Select Files"; the first copyedited file removing the assigned editor's notice; "Copyedited Files Uploaded: 0", "2" and "1" on the author's My Submissions row as files were added and deleted, a file copied in from "Draft Files" counted.

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — `lib/pkp/classes/decision/types/SendToProduction.php`: `getStageId()` `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING`, `getNewStageId()` `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_PRODUCTION`; `getSteps()` adds an `Email` step (`editor.submission.decision.notifyAuthors` "Notify Authors", mailable `DecisionSendToProductionNotifyAuthor`, `toRoleIds` `[ROLE_ID_AUTHOR]`) only when the submission has author participants, then a `PromoteFiles` step (`editor.submission.selectFiles` "Select Files", `editor.submission.decision.promoteFiles.production` "Select files that should be sent to the production stage.", target `SUBMISSION_FILE_PRODUCTION_READY`) with `addFileList(__('submission.copyedited'), …SUBMISSION_FILE_COPYEDIT)` selected by default and `addFileList(__('submission.finalDraft'), …SUBMISSION_FILE_FINAL, false)` not selected. `getCompletedLabel()` `editor.submission.decision.sendToProduction.completed` "Sent to Production"; `getCompletedMessage()` `….completed.description`. The arrival at Copyediting is `Accept` (review) and `SkipExternalReview` (submission) with `getNewStageId()` `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING`; their `PromoteFiles` target is `SUBMISSION_FILE_FINAL`, which is why the ticked files land in "Draft Files"; `Accept` lists the round's `SUBMISSION_FILE_REVIEW_REVISION` files ("Revisions") and `SkipExternalReview` the `SUBMISSION_FILE_SUBMISSION` files. No app subclasses either decision type. Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Rule 8, Side effects) and 2026-09-19 (Rule 2): the two pages, "Skip this email" landing on "Select Files", "Copyedited" ticked and "Draft Files" clear, an empty pair still recording, the bubble "Production", the ticked files as new rows in "Production Ready Files" and the unticked draft absent, the closing window "Sent to Production" with its message and the one link "View Submission Summary" back to the workflow; the wizard's "Cancel" asking "Are you sure you want to cancel this decision?" ("Cancel Decision" / "Keep Working"), "Cancel Decision" returning to Copyediting with both buttons and an edited subject dropped (the dialog is *Editorial decision recording*'s); "Accept Submission" listing "Revisions" alone (OJS with a file in "Files for Review" only: no box, "Draft Files" "No Items"; OMP with a revision ticked: a new "Draft Files" row) and "Accept and Skip Review" listing "Submission Files".

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `lib/pkp/classes/decision/types/BackFromCopyediting.php`: `getLabel()` `editor.submission.decision.backFromCopyediting`, whose text "Move to Review" is lib/pkp's `locale/en/submission.po` with no app override; `getNewStageId()` returns `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EXTERNAL_REVIEW` when `ReviewRoundDAO::submissionHasReviewRound()` finds an external round, else `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_INTERNAL_REVIEW` when it finds an internal one, else `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_SUBMISSION` (A1, OMP1); `runAdditionalActions()` sets the last review round's status to `REVIEW_ROUND_STATUS_RETURNED_TO_REVIEW`, a value that never reaches a screen (the round's status box is recomputed from its reviewers, *Review stage & rounds* Rules 5–6), and sends `DecisionBackFromCopyeditingNotifyAuthor`; `getSteps()` adds the "Notify Authors" `Email` step only. `getCompletedLabel()` "Sent Back from Copyediting". Files are never deleted by a decision; the Copyediting entry hides its lists while the stage is behind the active one and `Accept`'s `PromoteFiles` copies the newly ticked files into `SUBMISSION_FILE_FINAL` beside them. Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Rule 9, Side effects, A1, OMP1): the one-page wizard; a journal's submission landing on "Review (Round 1)" and a press's on External Review, a press with an internal round only on "Internal Review (Round 1)", a press with both on External Review; the round's box "Waiting for reviewers to be assigned." with no reviewers and "New reviews have been submitted." with a completed review, never a returned sentence; the round's decisions offered again; the never-reviewed submission landing on Submission with its decisions offered again; the closing window "Sent Back from Copyediting" with its message and "View Submission Summary"; while back in review the Copyediting entry reading "The Copyediting stage has not yet been initiated." with the Participants panel and no lists; after "Accept Submission" again both lists back with the earlier files, and a revision ticked on a third acceptance joining "Draft Files"; the log line under the assigned Section Editor's own name; the email sent, and none when skipped.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — `workflowConfigAuthorOJS.js` and `workflowConfigAuthorOMP.js` both define `[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING].getPrimaryItems` as `DiscussionManager` then `FileManager` namespace `COPYEDITED_FILES`; neither defines `getSecondaryItems` or `getActionItems` for the stage, and the author config has no `WorkflowNotificationDisplay` anywhere. The common `getPrimaryItems` stops at `WorkflowSubmissionStatus` while `hasNotSubmissionStartedStage()` holds (the "has not yet been initiated." box, U24 Rule 15a). The author's controls on the file list are note f's. Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Rule 11): the author's headings "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions" and "Copyedited Files" only, buttons "Library" and the panel's "Add", no "Notification" heading; before the stage, "Status" with "The Copyediting stage has not yet been initiated." and nothing else.

<a id="fn-j"></a>
**j** — `lib/pkp/controllers/grid/users/stageParticipant/form/PKPStageParticipantNotifyForm.php::execute()` → `sendMessage()`: the message creates an `EditorialTask` of type `DISCUSSION` with `createdBy` the recipient's id (A9: the panel therefore lists the Copyeditor as the creator) and a `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_NEW_QUERY` task row for them, and mails the message with `subject($template->getLocalizedData('title'))`, so the subject is the template's name "Request Copyedit" and the sender the signed-in editor; the locale's `emails.copyeditRequest.subject` ("Submission {$submissionId} is ready to be copyedited for {$contextAcronym}") is not used on this path. For the `COPYEDIT_REQUEST` template it also calls `_addAssignmentTaskNotification()` with `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_COPYEDIT_ASSIGNMENT` for the assignee and logs `SubmissionEmailLogEventType::COPYEDIT_NOTIFY_COPYEDITOR`. Task text: `PKPNotificationManager::getNotificationMessage()` → `notification.type.copyeditorRequest` "You have been asked to review copyedits for "{$title}"."; its link is the editorial dashboard with `workflowSubmissionId`. No code path deletes `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_COPYEDIT_ASSIGNMENT` (the grep of lib/pkp and both apps finds its creation only; the `LAYOUT_COMPLETE` / `INDEX_COMPLETE` branches clear their siblings) (A4). The Vue "Participants" panel opens the legacy `StageParticipantGridHandler` ops `addParticipant` and `viewNotify`, so the same form serves both; its "Choose a predefined message" list holds the stage's task templates (the registry templates the context factory installs; on a preprint "Discussion (Production)" and "Assign Editor"). Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Side effects, A4, A9) and 2026-09-19 (Actors row 8, Rule 7): the form's groups on OJS (Journal editor, Production editor, Section editor, Guest editor, Copyeditor, Marketing and sales coordinator, Author, Translator) and OMP (Press editor, Production editor, Series editor, Copyeditor, Marketing and sales coordinator, Author, Volume editor, Chapter Author, Translator), never the manager group; the templates "Discussion (Copyediting)" and "Request Copyedit"; "Cancel" after a user is chosen leaving the participants unchanged; the email "Request Copyedit" from the editor with the body quoted in Side effects and the discussion footer, none for a Copyeditor assigned without a message; the two Tasks rows, both surviving the first copyedited file and "Send To Production", the task row removed at once by the panel's "Delete" with the discussion row staying; the discussion row "Discussion Request Copyedit Created by: {Copyeditor}" without a "Discussion created by … on …" line, against an editor's own discussion carrying both.

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — OPS: `classes/core/Application.php::getApplicationStages()` returns `[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_PRODUCTION]`; `registry/userGroups.xml` installs manager, sectionEditor, author (`5,6`), reader and editorialBoardMember only, no copyeditor; `classes/submission/maps/Schema.php::getAvailableEditorialDecisions()` returns nothing outside Production and Done. `workflowConfigEditorialOPS.js` names `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING` once, in the header's "Preview" condition, and defines no stage entry for it. The scenario API rejects `copyeditor` as a role key on OPS (users.md section 2). Live-probed 2026-09-19 (Purpose, OPS1): the workflow menu "Workflow › Production" alone with "Post the preprint" and "Decline Submission"; a typed `workflowMenuKey=workflow_4` rewritten to `workflow_5` for the manager and the Moderator and landing the author on the publication pages; the Roles grid's five rows; the "Assign" form's three roles and two Production templates; Manage Emails without any of the three template names; the scenario API refusing `copyeditor`.

<a id="fn-l"></a>
**l** — `lib/pkp/pages/authorDashboard/PKPAuthorDashboardHandler.php::submission()` answers `redirectUrl()` to `dashboard/mySubmissions?workflowSubmissionId=<id>`; the template `lib/pkp/templates/controllers/tab/authorDashboard/editorial.tpl` (the old "Copyediting" tab with its copyedited-files grid, guarded by `stageId >= WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING` and `$canAccessCopyeditingStage`, else `submission.stageNotInitiated` "Stage not initiated.") is therefore never rendered. The forward itself is U24's Rule 2b. Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Rule 12): the own author lands on My Submissions with the Copyediting panels (`workflowMenuKey=workflow_4`) and no tab strip; a manager, a Copyeditor and a stranger author get U24's refusals; a preprint's author lands on the preprint's publication pages.

<a id="fn-m"></a>
**m** — `workflowConfigEditorialOJS.js` pushes the `editor.submission.schedulePublication` button in `[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_SUBMISSION].getActionItems` and `[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_PRODUCTION].getActionItems` only; `[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING].getActionItems` holds the two decision buttons alone. OMP shows the shortcut on Production only; its Submission stage has none (*[Submission stage](U25-submission-stage.md)* Rule 7). Live-probed 2026-09-19 (Rule 1): none on Copyediting on either app; OJS Submission and Production carry it, OMP Production alone.

<a id="fn-n"></a>
**n** — `useFileManagerConfig.js`: `FILE_SEND_TO_EDITOR` is granted to `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` on both lists and offered per row only when the file's extension is in `PANDOC_IMPORT_EXTENSIONS` (`docx`, `odt`, `rtf`, `tex`, `latex`, `md`, `markdown`); label `grid.action.sendToTextEditor` "Send to Text Editor"; it opens `WorkflowVersionDialogBody` in mode `sendToTextEditor` (dialog title `fileManager.sendFileToTextEditor` "Send File to Text Editor"). Mechanics belong to *Submission files*. Live-probed 2026-09-19 (Actors row 5): the entry on a Markdown row and not on a PDF row for the administrator and the manager, never for the Section Editor, the Copyeditor or the coordinator; pressing it opens "Send File to Text Editor" ("To which version would you like to send this file?", "Create New Version" / an unassigned version, Cancel / Confirm).

<a id="fn-o"></a>
**o** — `PKPNotificationManager` maps `Decision::SEND_TO_PRODUCTION` to `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_EDITOR_DECISION_SEND_TO_PRODUCTION`; `EditorDecisionNotificationManager::updateNotification()` deletes the submission's earlier editor-decision rows for the given users and creates the new one at `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_NORMAL` (not a task), text `notification.type.editorDecisionSendToProduction` "Production process started.", title `notification.type.editorDecisionTitle` "Latest editor decision.". Live-probed 2026-09-18 (Side effects): the row is written but no author screen shows "Production process started." (not the My Submissions row, the header's Tasks panel, which lists tasks only, nor the workflow's Copyediting or Production entries), so the body no longer claims it. Log lines: `editor.submission.decision.sendToProduction.log` "{$editorName} sent this submission to the production stage."; for the other decision `….backFromCopyediting.log` "{$editorName} has sent this submission back from the copyediting stage." (the log is *Submission activity log & notes*'); both seen the same day, plus "An email has been sent: Next steps for publishing your submission" when the email was not skipped.

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — Template names on Settings › Workflow › Emails: `mailable.decision.sendToProduction.notifyAuthor.name` "Sent to Production", `mailable.decision.backFromCopyediting.notifyAuthor.name` "Submission Sent Back from Copyediting"; default subjects `emails.editorDecisionSendToProduction.subject` "Next steps for publishing your submission", `emails.editorDecisionBackFromCopyediting.subject` "Your submission has been moved to review". Both mailables carry `fromRoleIds [ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR]`, `toRoleIds [ROLE_ID_AUTHOR]`. "Request Copyedit" is not a mailable on that screen: it is an `EditorialTask` template (`PKP\editorialTask\Template`) listed on the Workflow Settings tab "Tasks and Discussions" under "Copyediting Stage", edited in the window "Edit Task and Discussion Template" (Name, "Mark as unrestricted" / "Limit access to specific roles", the task information, a Discussion body, "Automatically add this task and/or discussion when a submission reaches the stage"); its title is the sent email's subject (note j). No passthrough key edits a template (scenarios.md). Live-probed 2026-09-19 (Settings bullets 2–3): Manage Emails listing the two mailables with their subjects and finding "No items found." for "Request Copyedit"; an edited "Sent to Production" subject and body prefilling "Send To Production: Notify Authors" on OJS and OMP; an edited "Request Copyedit" Discussion body prefilling the "Assign" form's message.

<a id="fn-q"></a>
**q** — Pointers and scope prose. The passages carrying this mark name features that describe their own screens and claim no screen of their own; the drives of 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-19 opened the screens they name only on the way to this stage's ("Edit a file", "Information Center: {file}", "Production Ready Files", the header's Tasks panel, Manage Emails, the Roles "Edit" form, My Submissions' "View").

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Seeding for the scenarios: the seeded journal `publicknowledge` and roster accounts (passwords = username doubled), scratch submissions through `POST scenarios/submission` with submitter `author.alex`. A submission at Copyediting after review: `decisions: ['sendExternalReview', 'accept']` with one `reviewRounds` entry (a completed `reviewer.julia`; on the press add `series: 'monographs'`); accepted without review: `decisions: ['skipExternalReview']`, which carries no notice for its editors (A6), so a notice scenario seeds `accept`; a press with an internal round only: `decisions: ['sendInternalReview', 'acceptFromInternal']` with one `reviewRounds` entry of `stage: 'internal'`. A Copyeditor: `participants: [{username: 'copyeditor.carla', role: 'copyeditor'}]`, which writes the assignment row without the "Assign" form's message, so on an `accept` seed the notice stays at "Assign a copyeditor…" (Rule 3a) until a discussion exists; the "Request Copyedit" path is driven on screen. Seeded submissions carry no files: a test uploads into "Draft Files" or "Copyedited Files" through "Upload/Select Files" › "Upload File" (a submission-stage file for the tick case comes from the Submission stage's "Submission Files" panel; a revision for the acceptance case is uploaded on the round). The notice box is read by its level-3 "Notification" heading. Mail reads are scoped by recipient in Mailpit at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`, so an email scenario runs on a scratch journal from `POST scenarios/context` with throwaway `roles: ['editor']`, `['copyeditor']` and `['author']` accounts. The roster holds no recommend-only assignment (the flag is set on screen through the Participants row's "Edit Assignment"). Editors: `editor.diana` (OJS, OMP), `manager.maya` for the unassigned-manager case; `sectioneditor.ana` is auto-assigned on a journal (section ART) but a monograph needs an explicit `participants` entry for a Series editor. Never decide on a shared roster submission. Per scenario: 1 an `accept` seed with `sectioneditor.omar` in `participants`, whose recommend-only flag the test sets on screen through the Participants row's "Edit Assignment" before the read, and `manager.maya` as the unassigned Journal Manager (on the press `sectioneditor.omar` is a Series editor of `monographs` and auto-assigned on submit, so the recommending editor is `sectioneditor.ravi`, assigned on screen through "Assign" with "Assignment privileges" ticked after the seed; the two routes are what A11 turns on); 2 a `sendExternalReview` seed, the test uploading one file through the round's "Files for Review" panel and one revision through its "Revisions Uploaded" panel before pressing "Accept Submission"; 4 an `accept` seed with `copyeditor.carla` in `participants`, the Copyeditor uploading through "Copyedited Files"; 5 an `accept` seed, the test uploading one copyedited file through "Copyedited Files" and one submission file through the Submission stage's "Submission Files" panel first; 8 an `accept` seed with one file uploaded by `editor.diana` through "Copyedited Files", read as `author.alex`; 9 `['sendInternalReview', 'acceptFromInternal']` for the first monograph and `['sendInternalReview', 'sendExternalReview', 'accept']` for the second; 10 a submitted preprint on the preprint server's `publicknowledge`, read as its manager. Scenarios 7 and 9 seed no `reviewRounds` entry, so the round the submission returns to has no reviewer and its box reads "Waiting for reviewers to be assigned.". Scenarios 3, 6 and 7 run on one scratch journal from `POST scenarios/context` with throwaway `users[]` of `roles: ['editor']`, `['copyeditor']` (two accounts, for scenario 3's control) and `['author']`; each of its submissions is seeded with the throwaway author as `submitter` and the throwaway editor in `participants` (nobody is auto-assigned on a scratch journal, and the notice shows only to an assigned editor); scenario 6's submission has one file uploaded through each list first, scenario 7's one through "Draft Files". Mailpit is read by recipient address; scenario 3's no-mail control is bounded by the first Copyeditor's email arriving. The recipe is the tooling's: no screen shows it.

<a id="fn-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — `BackFromCopyediting::getNewStageId()` (note h) falls through to `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_SUBMISSION` when `submissionHasReviewRound()` is false for both review stages; the label key `editor.submission.decision.backFromCopyediting` reads "Move to Review", and the mailable's body (`emails.editorDecisionBackFromCopyediting.body`) says "has been moved to the review stage. It will undergo further review before it can be accepted for publication." The class doc-comment states the three-way fall-through as designed, which is why the lean is on the wording. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OJS and OMP: the never-reviewed submission landed on "WORKFLOW: SUBMISSION" with the bubble "Submission" and its decisions offered again; the wizard's page read "Send an email to the authors to let them know that copyediting is cancelled and their submission will undergo further editorial review."; the author's mail carried the subject and body quoted.

<a id="fn-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — `useFileManagerConfig.js` `COPYEDITED_FILES.uploadSelectTitleKey: tk('editor.submissionReview.uploadFile')` ("Upload Review File"), where `FINAL_DRAFT_FILES` uses `editor.submission.uploadSelectFiles` ("Upload/Select Files"); `fileSelectUpload()` passes the key straight to `openLegacyModal({title})`. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OJS and OMP at every editorial level: the outer title "Upload Review File", the inner heading "Copyedited", the wizard "Upload Copyedited File"; uploads through it landed in the list.

<a id="fn-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — `PKPEditingProductionStatusNotificationManager::updateNotification()`, the `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING` branch (note d): the "copyeditor assigned" test is `EditorialTask::withAssoc(ASSOC_TYPE_SUBMISSION, $submissionId)->withStageId(WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING)->first()`, the code's own comment reading "If a copyeditor is assigned i.e. there is a copyediting discussion"; no stage-assignment or user-group check enters it. The same proxy is used for the production notices. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OJS and OMP: the no-message assignment left "Assign a copyeditor…" for both assigned editors; an editor's own discussion with the author, no Copyeditor on the submission, read "Awaiting Copyedits." once the workflow was reopened; the "Discussion (Copyediting)" template sent through "Assign" flipped it as the "Request Copyedit" one does.

<a id="fn-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — `PKPStageParticipantNotifyForm::execute()` creates `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_COPYEDIT_ASSIGNMENT` on `COPYEDIT_REQUEST`; `NotificationManagerDelegate` subclasses and the decision repository touch only the `ASSIGN_COPYEDITOR` / `AWAITING_COPYEDITS` pair; a grep for the constant across `lib/pkp`, `ojs` and `omp` finds `Notification.php` (definition), `PKPNotificationManager.php` (message and link) and the notify form (creation) only. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OJS and OMP: the row survived the first copyedited file and "Send To Production"; ticking it and pressing the panel's "Delete" removed it at once without a confirmation, the "{editor} started a discussion" row staying.

<a id="fn-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — Note c: `checkDecisionPermissions()` grants `canMakeDecision` to a recommend-only user only when `getDecisionTypesMadeByRecommendingUsers($stageId)` is non-empty, and both apps' `decision/Repository.php` list a type for `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_SUBMISSION` alone; `getAvailableEditorialDecisions()` then returns `[]`, and the review stage's `Recommend…` controls are the review config's, absent from `[WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING]`. The Submission-stage counterpart is *Submission stage*'s A2 (probed 2026-08-02). Live-probed 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-19 on OJS and OMP: the recommend-only Section Editor saw "Recommend Revisions", "Recommend Accept", "Recommend Decline" on the review round only with a deciding editor assigned, and on Copyediting no button or control in either case while the deciding editor beside them had both buttons; "Assign" stayed.

<a id="fn-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — `lib/pkp/classes/decision/Repository.php::getSubmissionNotificationTypes()` returns the `ASSIGN_COPYEDITOR` / `AWAITING_COPYEDITS` pair for `Decision::ACCEPT` and `Decision::SEND_TO_PRODUCTION` only; `Decision::SKIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW` (the "Accept and Skip Review" decision, whose `getNewStageId()` is also `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EDITING`) falls through to an empty list, so the decision creates no notice row for the editors assigned at that moment. Why a later "Assign" creates none either is not explained by the code read: `StageParticipantGridHandler::addParticipant()` does call `updateNotification()` for the pair at the editing stage, and the manager loops over every assigned editor; the observation stands on its own. Live-probed 2026-09-19 on OJS and OMP: a seeded `skipExternalReview` submission and one moved on screen by "Accept and Skip Review" showed the assigned Section Editor no "Notification" heading on landing, on the Copyediting entry, and after a second Section Editor was assigned through "Assign" (that editor saw none either); the same accounts read "Assign a copyeditor…" on submissions accepted from review the same day.

<a id="fn-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — `lib/pkp/classes/submissionFile/Repository.php::delete()`: for a `SUBMISSION_FILE_COPYEDIT` file it calls `updateNotification()` for the pair before `$this->dao->delete($submissionFile)`, so `PKPEditingProductionStatusNotificationManager` still counts the file being deleted, deletes both types, and nothing recomputes them once the row is gone. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OJS and OMP: "Delete" › OK on the only copyedited file left "Copyedited Files" at "No Items" and both assigned editors with no notice, on the same page, re-landed and minutes later, from the "Assign a copyeditor…" state and from the "Awaiting Copyedits." state.

<a id="fn-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — `ManageSubmissionFilesForm::importFile()` clones the ticked file into the target file stage with `sourceSubmissionFileId` set to the original's id. `Repository::delete()` removes dependent files (`SUBMISSION_FILE_DEPENDENT` rows attached to the file) and the stored file only when no other row shares it, and names no source link, so the code read gives no cause; the live observation stands alone. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OJS and OMP, once each: "Draft Files" held the copy of copyedited file 16 as row 17; after "Delete" › OK on row 16 in "Copyedited Files", "Draft Files" listed rows 14 and 13 only. The reverse direction was not driven.

<a id="fn-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — `PKPStageParticipantNotifyForm::sendMessage()` creates the `EditorialTask` with `'createdBy' => $user->getId()`, where `$user` is the message's recipient, and adds the recipient and the sender as participants; the panel's row prints `createdBy`, and the row's "Discussion created by … on …" line is absent for it. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OJS and OMP: the row "Discussion Request Copyedit Created by: {the Copyeditor's username}" after the editor's "Assign" with the "Request Copyedit" message, against the editor's own "Add" discussion listed as "Created by: {editor} Discussion created by {editor} ({role}) on {date}"; the Copyeditor's Tasks row "{editor} started a discussion: Request Copyedit: …".

<a id="fn-a10"></a>
**f-a10** — `lib/pkp/controllers/grid/settings/roles/form/UserGroupForm.php::execute()`: the stages are rewritten by `_assignStagesToUserGroup()` only inside `if ($assignedStages)`, so a form saved with every box clear leaves the stored stages untouched while the grid answers "Your changes have been saved."; `getAlwaysActiveStages()` (`ROLE_ID_MANAGER`) explains the manager row's missing "Edit". Live-probed 2026-09-19 on OJS and OMP: the Copyeditor role with Copyediting as its only stage, unticked and saved, twice; the same with Production as the only stage; the form reopened with the box ticked each time; unticking Copyediting while ticking Production saved.

<a id="fn-a11"></a>
**f-a11** — Test run 2026-09-19 on OMP (scenario 1, one run): `sectioneditor.ravi`, assigned as Series editor through the "Assign" form with "Assignment privileges" ticked after the `accept` seed had run, opened the monograph's Copyediting entry to the headings "Draft Files", "Copyediting Tasks & Discussions" and "Copyedited Files" with no "Notification" heading, while `editor.diana`, in the seed's `participants`, read "Assign a copyeditor using the Assign link in the Participants list." on the same monograph. The same day on OJS, `sectioneditor.omar`, in the seed's `participants` (a row the scenario API writes after its decisions have run, so also after the acceptance, without the "Assign" form) and flagged through the Participants row's "Edit Assignment", read the "Notification" heading; the route, not the timing, is what differs between the two reads. Note d's code path (`StageParticipantGridHandler::addParticipant()` calling `updateNotification()` for the pair) predicts a row for the added editor and note f-a6 records the same silence after "Assign" on the skip-review path; the observation stands on its own.

<a id="fn-a12"></a>
**f-a12** — Test run 2026-09-19 on OMP (scenario 6, one run) and on OJS the same day: after "Send To Production", the "Copyediting" entry's main column read "Status" ("The submission is currently in the Production stage."), "Draft Files", "Production Tasks & Discussions", "Copyedited Files", with "Participants" on the right and no button; no discussion existed on either stage. Note a's `getDiscussionTitleByStage()` in `useDiscussionManagerHelpers.js` names the heading by a stage id; which id the entry passes after the move was not read.

<a id="fn-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — Note h: the external-then-internal-then-submission order of `BackFromCopyediting::getNewStageId()`; OMP's `Schema.php` uses the shared class unchanged, and OMP's `Application::getApplicationStages()` lists both review stages. Live-probed 2026-09-18 on OMP: an internal round only → "Internal Review (Round 1)"; internal then external → External Review, the internal entry reading "The submission is currently in the External Review stage."; an external round only → External Review; neither → Submission.

<a id="fn-ops1"></a>
**f-ops1** — Note k. Live-probed 2026-09-19 on OPS: the manager, the Moderator and the author at their three levels; the typed `workflow_4` address; the Roles grid; the "Assign" form; Manage Emails; the scenario API's refusal of `copyeditor`.
