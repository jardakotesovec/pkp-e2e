# Review setup & review forms {OJS OMP}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

A Journal Manager decides how peer review runs before any reviewer is
invited. Everything for that sits on one screen, Settings › Workflow › Review,
in four side tabs: "Setup" (the default review mode, what reviewers may
access, the default deadlines, the minimum number of reviews, and the clocks
of the automatic reminder emails), "Reviewer Guidance" (the guidelines and
the competing-interests policy reviewers read), "Review Forms" (structured
questionnaires a reviewer fills in instead of two free-text boxes) and, on a
journal, "Reviewer Recommendations" (the list a reviewer picks a
recommendation from). None of it is visible to a reviewer directly: each
setting takes effect on the editor's Reviewers panel
([→ reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#search))
or in the reviewer's wizard
([→ reviewer's review](U28-reviewers-review.md#wizard)), and this spec says
which setting lands where. The wizard itself, the request emails and the
editor's windows stay with their own specs. <sup>a</sup>

OPS does not install a review stage, so its Workflow Settings screen has no
"Review" tab: a Preprint Server Manager sees "Submission", "Preprint Server
Library", "Emails" and "Tasks and Discussions" only, and nothing in this
spec has a screen on a preprint server (scenario 11). <sup>b</sup>

On a press the "Review" tab has three side tabs: "Setup", "Reviewer
Guidance" and "Review Forms". A press collects no reviewer recommendation,
so it has no "Reviewer Recommendations" tab [OMP1](#omp1); its "Reviewer
Guidance" tab carries two guideline boxes, one per review stage, and a few
labels are worded differently [OMP2](#omp2). <sup>b</sup>

## Actors & permissions

**Terms used below.** The **manager roles** are the roles at the Journal
Manager permission level whose role settings allow access to the journal's
settings: on the seeded journals the Journal Manager and the Editor (a
Journal Editor group at the manager level). A **form in use** is a review
form that at least one review assignment carries (an assignment the
reviewer has not declined; Rule 12). A **recommendation in use** is one
some reviewer has chosen on a submitted review (Rule 18). <sup>c</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Open Settings › Workflow › Review** (all its side tabs) | • Manager roles and the Site Administrator: the sidebar's "Settings" is a collapsed group; opened, it lists "Workflow", which leads there<br>• Section Editor, Assistant, Reviewer, Author: the sidebar has no "Settings" group, and the typed address lands on a page reading "The current role does not have access to this operation."<br>• Reader: no sidebar at all (the journal's sign-in lands on the reader site); the typed address lands on the same page <sup>c</sup> |
| **Save "Setup" and "Reviewer Guidance"** | • Manager roles and the Site Administrator: the tab's "Save" <sup>c</sup> |
| **Create, edit, copy, preview, order, activate and deactivate review forms** | • Manager roles and the Site Administrator. "Edit" and "Delete" are offered only on a form not in use (Rule 12); "Copy", "Preview" and the "Active" tick are offered on every form <sup>c</sup> |
| **Add, edit, delete and order a form's items** | • Manager roles and the Site Administrator, only while the form is not in use (Rule 12): the "Form Items" tab is greyed out for a form in use <sup>c</sup> |
| **Add, edit, delete, activate and deactivate a reviewer recommendation** {OJS} | • Manager roles and the Site Administrator. "Edit" and "Delete" are offered only on a recommendation not in use (Rule 18); the "Activate" tick is offered on every row <sup>c</sup> |

## Fields & validation

**"Setup" tab.** One form with "Save" at the bottom. The boxes below are
the form's, in screen order. <sup>d</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Default Review Mode" | yes (one is always selected) | Radio: "Anonymous Reviewer/Anonymous Author" (the install default), "Anonymous Reviewer/Disclosed Author", "Open". Effect: Rule 3 |
| "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments" (help "Enable this setting if you'd like the review process to be made publicly visible alongside published submissions. This supports transparent peer review practices and can help foster greater trust and accountability.") — box "Make reviewer comments publicly visible with published content" | no | Off by default. Effect: Rule 4 |
| "Restrict File Access" (no help text) — box "Reviewers will not be given access to the submission file until they have agreed to review it." (on a press "Reviewers will have access to the submission file only after agreeing to review it." [OMP2](#omp2)) | no | Off by default. Effect: Rule 5 |
| "One-click Reviewer Access" (help "Reviewers can be sent a secure link in the email invitation, which will log them in automatically when they click the link.") — box "Include a secure link in the email invitation to reviewers." | no | Off by default. Effect: Rule 5 |
| "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" (help "Author can suggest several potential reviewers before completing the submission which can streamline the review process and provide valuable input for editorial team.") — box "Allow authors to suggest potential reviewers at submission process" | no | Off by default. Effect: Rule 6 |
| "Default Response Deadline" (help "Number of weeks to accept or decline a review request.") | no | A whole number of weeks, 0 or more; the install default is 4. Letters or a decimal are refused with "This is not a valid integer."; a negative number with "This must be at least 0.". An emptied box is accepted, comes back blank after a reload and behaves like 0 (Rule 7). Effect: Rule 7 |
| "Default Completion Deadline" (help "Weeks allowed to complete the review"; on a press "Weeks allowed for review completion" [OMP2](#omp2)) | no | As above; install default 4. Effect: Rule 7 |
| "Minimum Confirmed Reviews Required" (help "Minimum number of confirmed reviews required for a submission") | no | A whole number, 0 or more; install default 0. The same refusals as the deadlines; an emptied box comes back as "0". Effect: Rule 8 |
| "Set Reminders for Review" (help "Send an email reminder before or after for review request response (if reviewer has not responded to review request yet) or review submission (if reviewer has not submitted review yet)") — four sliders: "Review Request Response - Before Due Date", "Review Request Response - After Due Date", "Review Submission - Before Due Date", "Review Submission - After Due Date" | no | Each slider runs between its end labels "None" and "14", set by dragging, by a click on the track or by the keyboard arrows (one day per press); a box beside it reads the value back: "No reminder set" at the left end, otherwise "{n} days before due date" / "{n} days after due date" ("1 days" at 1; there is no singular). The install default is "No reminder set" on all four. Effect: Rule 9 |

**"Reviewer Guidance" tab.** One form with "Save". Every text box here is a
rich-text box. With more than one form language the form shows a language
switch at its top ("French" beside "English"), each box reads "{n}/2
languages completed", and pressing "French" shows a second box "… in French"
under each; one "Save" saves both languages (the seeded journals have
English only). No box carries help text. <sup>e</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| {OMP} "Internal Review Guidelines" | no | Empty by default. Shown to Internal Reviewers on their wizard's step 2 and 3 (Rule 10). Its toolbar has no quote or list buttons, unlike the two boxes under it ⚠ [OMP3](#omp3) |
| "Review Guidelines" (on a press "External Review Guidelines") | no | Empty by default. Shown to reviewers on the wizard's step 2 and 3 (Rule 10) |
| "Competing Interests" | no | Empty by default. Set, the wizard's step 1 asks the reviewer to declare competing interests (Rule 10) |
| Box "Present a link to how to ensure all files are anonymized during upload" | no | Off by default. The words "how to ensure all files are anonymized" inside the sentence are a button that opens a window "How to ensure all files are anonymized" with the instructions, closed with "Close" (there is no "OK"); pressing the words does not tick the box. Effect: Rule 11 |

**"Review Forms" tab.** A list titled "Review Forms" with "Create Review
Form" above it ("Order" joins it once the list has two forms) and the
columns "Title", "In Review", "Completed" and "Active"; "No Items" while
the journal has none. The windows opened from it are headed "Create Review
Form", "Edit" (a form's and an item's edit window alike), "Preview" and
"Create New Item". A refused save leaves the window open: an empty "Title"
or an unchosen "Item type" shows "This field is required." under the box,
while an empty "Item" with a type chosen shows the notice "A question is
required for the form item. (English)" and nothing under the box:
<sup>f</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Create Review Form" window (and the "Review Form" tab of a form's "Edit" window): "Title" | yes | Text, one box per form language. Refused empty |
| Same window: "Description and Instructions" | no | Rich text, one box per form language. Shown to the reviewer above the questions and in the preview |
| "Create New Item" window (and an item's "Edit" window): "Item" | yes | Rich text, per form language: the question the reviewer answers. Refused empty, by the notice quoted above the table |
| Same window: "Description" | no | Rich text, per form language: help shown under the question |
| Same window: box "Reviewers required to complete item" | no | Off by default. On, the reviewer cannot submit the review with the item unanswered (Rule 15) |
| Same window: box "Included in message to author" | no | On by default. Off, the item and its answer are left out of what the author gets to read (Rule 15) |
| Same window: "Item type" | yes | A list: "Choose item type" (preselected, the empty choice), "Single word text box", "Single line text box", "Extended text box", "Checkboxes (you can choose one or more)", "Radio buttons (you can only choose one)", "Drop-down box". Saved with "Choose item type" still selected, the window is refused |
| Same window: "Response Options" list with an "Add Item" link (no column heading) | for the three choice types | Each row is one answer the reviewer can pick, per form language. "Add Item" is offered whatever the type, even before one is chosen: it adds an editable row at the bottom, one text box at a time, and fixes the previous row. Changing "Item type" shows no warning and the rows stay listed; they are kept when the item is saved with a choice type and dropped when it is saved with a text type ⚠ [A5](#a5) (Rule 14) |

**"Reviewer Recommendations" tab {OJS}.** A table titled "Reviewer
Recommendations" with the button "Add Recommendation", the columns
"Recommendations" and "Activate" (a tick per row), and an unnamed third
column holding the "More Actions" menu of a row not in use. Its window
("Add Recommendation" / "Edit Recommendation") has one button, "Save"; a
refused save shows "This field is required." under each empty required
box and, at the foot, "Please correct 2 errors." (or "Please correct one
error." for one) with "Jump to next error"; it sends nothing, stays open,
and "Save" is greyed out until the boxes are filled: <sup>g</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Review Recommendations" (help "e.g. accept, reject") | yes | Text, one box per form language: the words the reviewer picks. Refused empty |
| "Recommendation type" | yes | A list: "Approved", "Not Approved", "Revisions Requested", "With Comments"; nothing is preselected, and the entry is refused without a choice. The type is shown nowhere else: not to the reviewer, not in the editor's review windows, not in the table |
| The unlabelled list under it | yes | A list: "Active Upon Saving" (preselected) or "Deactivate": whether the entry is offered to reviewers as soon as it is saved (Rule 17) |

## Rules & state

<a id="screen"></a>
1. **The screen.** Settings › Workflow (page heading "Workflow Settings")
   has a "Review" tab between "Submission" and "Publisher Library" (on a
   press "Press Library" [OMP2](#omp2)). Its side tabs are "Setup",
   "Reviewer Guidance", "Review Forms" and, on a journal, "Reviewer
   Recommendations". Pressing a tab changes the page address, but a reload
   lands on "Submission" › "Disable Submissions" whatever tab was open
   ⚠ [A4](#a4). <sup>a</sup>

2. **Saving "Setup" and "Reviewer Guidance".** "Save" writes the whole form
   at once. A successful save shows no page notice: "Saving" then "Saved"
   appear beside the button, and "Saved" is gone after about five seconds.
   A refused box shows its reason in a red badge under the box; beside
   "Save" at the foot of the form, "Please correct one error." (or "Please
   correct {n} errors.") and a button "Jump to next error" appear; a page
   notice reads "The form was not saved because 1 error(s) were
   encountered. Please correct these errors and try again."; "Save" is
   greyed out; and nothing on the form is saved, not even the boxes that
   passed. Switching side tabs with unsaved edits keeps
   them, with no warning: back on the tab, the edited values are still
   there. A reload drops them, with no warning either: the tab shows the
   saved values again. Nothing here sends an email. <sup>d</sup>

<a id="review-mode"></a>
3. **"Default Review Mode"** is what the editor's Add Reviewer window
   preselects as "Review Type" on every new request ([→ finding a
   reviewer](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#search)). Changing
   it later changes the preselection only: requests already made keep the
   type they were made with. The type is what the reviewer reads on the
   wizard's step 1 ([→ step 1](U28-reviewers-review.md#step-1)). <sup>d</sup>

4. **"Publicly Show Reviewer Comments"** sets the default of the "Publicly
   Show Reviewer Comments" box in the editor's Add Reviewer window and the
   assignment's "Edit" window: on, that box arrives ticked on every new
   request; off, unticked. A request made before the change keeps its box
   as it was. What a ticked box does to the published article belongs to
   *Article landing page & reading*. <sup>d</sup>

<a id="access"></a>
5. **Reviewer access.** "Restrict File Access" on: a reviewer sees the
   files for review only after accepting the request (the wizard's step 3
   instead of step 1). "One-click Reviewer Access" on: every request and
   reminder email to a reviewer carries a personal sign-in-free link. Both
   effects are the reviewer's-review spec's
   ([→ one-click access](U28-reviewers-review.md#one-click)); the automatic
   reminders of Rule 9 mint such a link too when the box is on (no screen
   shows those emails on the test installs, Rule 9e). <sup>d</sup>

6. **"Reviewer Suggestion at Submission"** on: the submission wizard gains
   the step "Reviewer Suggestions", between "For the Editors" and "Review",
   where the author names potential reviewers (*Submission wizard*); how
   the editors then see the suggestions belongs to *Reviewer suggestions*.
   Off (the default), the step is absent. <sup>d</sup>

<a id="deadlines"></a>
7. **The default deadlines.** When an editor opens Add Reviewer, "Response
   Due Date" is preset to today plus "Default Response Deadline" weeks and
   "Review Due Date" to today plus "Default Completion Deadline" weeks; the
   editor can change both before sending
   ([→ deadlines](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#due-dates)).
   A deadline saved as 0 or left empty is not "no deadline": Add Reviewer
   then presets three weeks for the response and four for the review
   ⚠ [A3](#a3). Requests already sent keep their dates. <sup>h</sup>

8. **"Minimum Confirmed Reviews Required"** above 0 adds a first line to
   the round status on the review stage: "Minimum number of confirmed
   reviews required: {N}." A review counts as confirmed once the editor has
   marked it complete (Read Review › "Mark as Complete") or thanked the
   reviewer; an accepted, submitted or viewed review does not count. When
   that many are confirmed the line stays and the round's own line under it
   becomes "Minimum required number of reviews have been confirmed. A
   decision is needed."
   ([→ the round status box](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#round-status)).
   At 0 nothing is required and no such line appears. <sup>d</sup>

<a id="reminders"></a>
9. **The automatic reminder clocks.** Once a day the install looks at every
   review request that is still open (sent, not declined, not cancelled, not
   yet submitted) on a submission still awaiting a decision, and sends the
   reviewer a reminder email when one of the four sliders says so. A slider
   at "No reminder set" never sends. <sup>i</sup>
   - 9a. **Before the reviewer has answered**, the two "Review Request
     Response" sliders count against the request's response due date:
     "Before Due Date" sends once when today is within that many days
     before the due date and the reviewer has not been reminded yet;
     "After Due Date" sends once when the due date is at least that many
     days past. The email is "Review Response Overdue (Automated)"
     (subject "Will you be able to review this for us?"; on a press
     "Manuscript Review Request" [OMP2](#omp2)).
   - 9b. **After the reviewer has accepted**, the two "Review Submission"
     sliders count the same way against the review due date, and the email
     is "Review Reminder (Automated)" (subject "A reminder to please
     complete your review").
   - 9c. Each reminder, automatic or the editor's own "Send Reminder",
     stamps the assignment's "Reminder" date
     ([→ reminders](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#reminders))
     and writes "An automatic reminder email was sent to {reviewer}
     regarding their review assignment" to the activity log. The
     reviewer's acceptance clears that date, which is what lets the
     submission-side clock start afresh.
   - 9d. An "After Due Date" reminder is sent only to a reviewer who has
     already been reminded once (by the "Before" clock or by an editor).
     With "Before Due Date" at "No reminder set" and nobody pressing "Send
     Reminder", the "After Due Date" slider never sends ⚠ [A1](#a1).
   - 9e. Both emails are templates the manager can edit on the "Manage
     Emails" page, reached from the "Add and edit templates" link on
     Settings › Workflow › "Emails" (*Emails management*); they are sent
     from the journal's principal contact. On the test installs the daily
     clock is switched off, so no scenario drives it (Settings).

<a id="guidance"></a>
10. **Guidance texts.** "Review Guidelines" set: the reviewer wizard's
    step 2 shows "Reviewer Guidelines" and then the text, and step 3 gains
    a "Reviewer Guidelines" block whose link "Review Guidelines" opens the
    text in a window closed with "OK". Left empty, step 2 reads "This
    publisher has not set any reviewer guidelines." and step 3 has no such
    block. On a press an Internal Reviewer reads the "Internal Review
    Guidelines" text and an External Reviewer the "External Review
    Guidelines" text, both under the wizard's "Reviewer Guidelines" heading
    and its "Review Guidelines" window [OMP2](#omp2). "Competing Interests"
    set: step 1 shows a "Competing
    Interests" block reading "This publisher has a policy for disclosure
    of potential competing interests from its reviewers. Please take a
    moment to review this policy.", a link "Competing Interests" that opens
    the typed text in a window closed with "OK", and the choices "I do not
    have any competing interests" (preselected) and "I may have competing
    interests (Specify below)"; the text itself is not printed on the step.
    Empty: the block is absent. On a press the one "Competing Interests"
    text reaches Internal and External Reviewers alike. The wizard's
    rendering is [→ step 1](U28-reviewers-review.md#step-1). <sup>e</sup>

11. **The anonymizing link.** With "Present a link to how to ensure all
    files are anonymized during upload" on, the file upload window on the
    Submission and Review stages shows a link "How to ensure all files are
    anonymized" that opens the same instructions the settings box links
    to, here with "OK" and "Cancel" (*Submission files*). Off, the upload
    window has no such link. <sup>e</sup>

<a id="forms"></a>
12. **A review form's life.** "Create Review Form" saves a new form as
    inactive, at the bottom of the list, with no items. Only an **active**
    form (the "Active" tick) is offered to editors. While the journal has
    at least one active form, Add Reviewer and the "Edit" window of a
    review still in progress show a "Review Form" list whose first entry is
    "None / Free Form Review" (the assignment's own form selected); with no
    active form those windows have no "Review Form" list at all, and a
    completed review's "Edit" window never has one. A journal section's
    "Review Form" list (*Sections*) offers the active forms the same way. The list's "In Review" column counts the
    assignments carrying the form whose review is not yet submitted,
    "Completed" those submitted; a declined request counts in neither ⚠
    [A8](#a8). A form with both at 0 is **not in use**: its row offers "Edit", "Copy",
    "Preview" and "Delete". A **form in use** offers "Copy" and "Preview"
    only; its window opens on "Preview Form" with the "Review Form" and
    "Form Items" tabs greyed out, so a form in use never changes under the
    reviewers who have it. The "Active" tick still toggles on a form in
    use, and the confirmation says the opposite ⚠ [A2](#a2). <sup>f</sup>
    - 12a. **Activate / deactivate.** Ticking "Active" opens a window
      "Confirm" asking "Are you sure you wish to activate this review form?
      Once it's assigned to a review you will no longer be able to
      deactivate it." (asked even on a form assignments already carry);
      unticking asks "Are you sure you wish to deactivate this review form?
      It will no longer be available for new review assignments.". "OK"
      applies it with the notice "Your changes have been saved.", "Cancel"
      leaves the tick as it was. A deactivated form leaves the editors'
      lists at once; assignments already carrying it keep it, and their
      reviewers still see the form on the wizard's step 3, but the
      reviewer row's "Edit" window no longer shows the form it carries and
      its "OK" detaches it ⚠ [A9](#a9).
    - 12b. **Copy** asks, in the same "Confirm" window, "Are you sure you
      wish to create a copy of this review form?" and adds an inactive
      form at the bottom of the list with the same title (no suffix), the
      same description and the items in their current order, with "Edit"
      and "Delete" offered again. It is the only way to change a form in
      use: copy it, edit the copy, activate the copy.
    - 12c. **Delete** asks, in the same window, "Are you sure you wish to
      delete this review form?" and removes the form with its items. It is
      offered on a form not in use only.
    - 12d. **Order.** "Order" above the list switches to ordering mode:
      rows are dragged, then "Done" (under the rows) keeps the new order
      with no notice and "Cancel ordering" restores the old. "Order" and
      "Create Review Form" stay above the list meanwhile. The order is the
      order of the editors' "Review Form" lists.

<a id="edit-window"></a>
13. **The form's window** (row "Edit"; headed "Edit") has three tabs:
    "Review Form" (the title and description form with "Save"), "Form
    Items" (the items list) and "Preview Form" (the form as a reviewer will
    see it: title, description, then every item in order; a required item
    carries "*" right after its question, an item's description sits
    between that mark and the answer control, and the controls can be
    typed into, though nothing is sent). Saving on "Review Form" closes
    the window and shows the page notice "Your changes have been saved.",
    with the list behind updated. Row "Preview" opens the same window
    headed "Preview" on "Preview Form"; on a form in use the two other
    tabs are greyed out and pressing them does nothing (Rule 12).
    <sup>f</sup>

<a id="items"></a>
14. **Items.** "Form Items" lists the items in order under the column
    "Item" with "Create New Item" above ("Order" joins it once items are
    listed) and "No Items" while empty. Each row offers "Edit" (the item
    window again, headed "Edit") and "Delete" (which asks "Confirm delete of a published form item..."
    before removing). The item window is Fields; a saved item closes the
    window with the notice "Your changes have been saved." and lands at
    the bottom, and "Order" reorders items as Rule 12d does forms. The
    three choice types keep the "Response Options" rows as the choices the
    reviewer sees. Of the text types, "Single word text box" and "Single
    line text box" both show the same one-line box and "Extended text box"
    a several-line box. Saving an item that has "Response Options" with a
    text type drops the options without the warning the app carries for
    it ⚠ [A5](#a5). <sup>f</sup>

15. **What an item does for the reviewer.** The wizard's step 3 shows the
    form's title, description and items instead of its two free-text boxes
    ([→ step 3](U28-reviewers-review.md#step-3)). "Reviewers required to
    complete item" makes the item one the reviewer must answer: "Submit
    Review" and its "Are you sure you want to submit this review?"
    confirmation still run, then step 3 stays with "This field is
    required." under the item. "Included in message to author" unticked
    keeps the item and its answer out of everything the author is given: the reviews
    an editor copies into a decision email (*Editorial decision recording*)
    and the author's own reading of an open review
    ([→ reading reviews as the author](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#author-read-review));
    the editor still reads it in full. <sup>f</sup>

16. **Languages.** A journal with more than one form language gives every
    multilingual box in this spec a version per language, shown in two
    ways: the "Reviewer Guidance" form and, on a journal, the "Add
    Recommendation" window carry a language switch at the top ("French"
    beside "English") that reveals a second box under each; in the "Review
    Forms" windows the twin, labelled "(French)" on a text box and "French"
    on a rich-text box, opens under the main-language box only while that
    box is focused. The reviewer reads the version of their interface
    language and falls back to the journal's main language. The seeded
    journals have one form language, so every box appears once (Settings).
    <sup>e</sup>

<a id="recommendations"></a>
17. **Reviewer recommendations {OJS}.** A journal starts with six entries,
    all active and in this order: "Accept Submission", "Revisions
    Required", "Resubmit for Review", "Resubmit Elsewhere", "Decline
    Submission", "See Comments". The active entries, in the table's order,
    are the "Recommendation" list a reviewer picks from on the wizard's
    step 3; an inactive entry is hidden there, except on a review that
    already carries it. "Add Recommendation" opens the window of Fields;
    saving closes it and the new entry appears in the table, active or not
    as the last list said. The "Activate" tick asks "Are you sure you want
    to activate the recommendation {title}" (window "Activate Reviewer
    Recommendation") or "Are you sure you want to deactivate the
    recommendation {title}" ("Deactivate Reviewer Recommendation"), with
    "Yes" / "No". The table has no fixed order ⚠ [A7](#a7): on the test
    installs a new entry has always appeared last, but an edited or ticked
    entry sometimes stays where it is and sometimes drops to the bottom,
    and the same steps give either on different runs; the reviewer's list
    is the ticked rows in whatever order the table shows. Adding, editing
    and the tick redraw the table with no notice. <sup>g</sup>

18. **A recommendation in use** (chosen on at least one submitted review)
    has no "More Actions" menu: it can be neither edited nor deleted, only
    deactivated and reactivated. While it is deactivated, the Reviewers
    table still prints it under the reviewer's status ("Review Submitted",
    or "Review Viewed" once an editor has opened the review), and the
    editor's "Read Review" window still lists "Recommendation: {title}" at
    the top but prints "-" in its "Reviewer Recommendation" section;
    reactivated, the section prints the title again ⚠ [A6](#a6). An entry
    not in use offers "Edit" (the
    same window, prefilled, "Edit Recommendation") and "Delete", which asks
    "Are you sure you want to delete the recommendation {title}" (window
    "Delete Recommendation"), "Yes" / "No". The six starting entries can be
    edited and deleted like any other while not in use. <sup>g</sup>

## Side effects

- **Saving "Setup" or "Reviewer Guidance"**: the journal's settings change;
  the form's own "Saved" is the only notice (Rule 2); no email.
  <sup>d</sup>
- **The automatic reminder** (Rule 9): one email to the reviewer per
  trigger, from the principal contact, with a one-click link when Rule 5's
  box is on; the assignment's "Reminder" date; an activity-log row "An
  automatic reminder email was sent to {reviewer} regarding their review
  assignment"; the email is also logged on the submission. <sup>i</sup>
- **Review form actions** (create, save, copy, activate, deactivate, delete,
  and every item action): the page notice "Your changes have been saved."
  and the list redrawn; ordering's "Done" redraws with no notice; nothing
  is emailed. Deleting a form is silent towards assignments: it is offered
  only when none carries it. <sup>f</sup>
- **Recommendation actions** {OJS}: the table redraws with no notice;
  nothing is emailed. Deactivating an entry hides it from reviewers who
  have not yet chosen; a review already submitted with it keeps it in the
  Reviewers table and in the "Recommendation:" line of the editor's "Read
  Review" window but loses it in that window's "Reviewer Recommendation"
  section ⚠ [A6](#a6) (Rule 18). <sup>g</sup>

## Settings that modify behavior

The tabs of this spec are themselves the settings other review features
read; the list below is what changes *these* screens.

- **The app's review stages.** OPS has none, so the "Review" tab is absent
  (the absence paragraph; scenario 11). A press has two, which is why
  "Reviewer Guidance" carries two guideline boxes [OMP2](#omp2); scenario 5
  runs on both apps and reads the press's second box.
- **Reviewer recommendations are a journal feature.** The "Reviewer
  Recommendations" tab exists on a journal only [OMP1](#omp1); scenarios 9
  and 10 are OJS scenarios, and OMP's suite carries one absence check.
- **Form languages** (Settings › Website › Setup › Languages, the "Forms"
  column; *Languages & locales*): a second form language adds a language
  switch at the top of the "Reviewer Guidance" form and a twin under each
  "Review Forms" box (Rule 16). No scenario of its own: the seeded and
  scratch journals have one form language, and multilingual box mechanics
  belong to the languages spec.
- **A role's settings access** (Settings › Users & Roles › Roles; *Roles
  configuration*): a manager-level role whose settings access is switched
  off loses the "Settings" group and this screen with it (Actors). No
  scenario: the switch is the roles spec's; Actors' access rows are probed
  with the seeded roles.
- **A section's default "Review Form"** (Settings › Journal › Sections, on a
  journal; *Sections*): set, Add Reviewer preselects that form for
  submissions in the section instead of "None / Free Form Review" (Rule
  12). No scenario: the field is the sections spec's and a test cannot seed
  it; the preselect is read once by hand.
- **The test installs' clock.** The daily reminder task and the mail queue
  are off on the test installs, so Rule 9 is described from the code and
  the reminder emails have no scenario; the sliders' saving does (scenario
  1).

## Cross-feature interactions

- **Reviewer assignment & management**: the Add Reviewer and "Edit"
  windows where the review mode, the deadlines, the public-visibility box
  and the "Review Form" list take effect; "Send Reminder" and the
  assignment's "Reminder" date; the editor's "Read Review" window with its
  "Download Review Form" button and "Recommendation" line.
- **Reviewer's review**: the wizard where the guidelines, the
  competing-interests declaration, the restricted files, the one-click link,
  the review form's questions and the recommendation list appear.
- **Review stage & rounds**: the round status sentence driven by "Minimum
  Confirmed Reviews Required", and the author's reading of a review.
- **Editorial decision recording**: the decision email's copied reviews,
  where "Included in message to author" filters the items.
- **Submission wizard** and **Reviewer suggestions**: the author's
  suggestion step switched on by "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission", and
  what the editors see of the suggestions.
- **Submission files**: the upload window's "How to ensure all files are
  anonymized" link.
- **Sections**: a journal section's default "Review Form".
- **Emails management**: the two automated reminder templates, on the
  "Manage Emails" page.
- **Submission activity log & notes**: the automatic-reminder row (no screen
  shows it on the test installs, whose clock is off; Rule 9c).
- **Roles configuration** and **Languages & locales**: the settings access
  and the form languages listed under Settings.
- **Article landing page & reading**: what "Publicly Show Reviewer Comments"
  eventually shows on a published article.

## Canonical scenarios

Scenarios 1 to 8 each start on their own scratch journal at install
defaults, with throwaway accounts (Journal Manager, Reviewer, Author and a
seeded submission in review); scenarios 9 and 10 are journal-only; scenario
11 runs on the seeded preprint server with a ready account. Access checks
use the seeded journal's ready accounts. <sup>s0</sup>

1. **Save the review setup**: Journal Manager: open Settings › Workflow ›
   "Review" › "Setup". Choose "Open" under "Default Review Mode", type 2 in
   "Default Response Deadline" and 1 in "Minimum Confirmed Reviews
   Required", drag "Review Request Response - Before Due Date" to 3 (the
   box beside it reads "3 days before due date"), press "Save": "Saved"
   appears beside the button. Reload the page and open "Review" › "Setup"
   again: every value shows as saved. Open the submission's review stage and
   press "Add Reviewer": "Review Type" has "Open" preselected and "Response
   Due Date" is two weeks from today. <sup>s1</sup>

2. **A refused deadline saves nothing**: Journal Manager: on "Setup", type
   `abc` in "Default Completion Deadline" and change "Default Review Mode"
   to "Anonymous Reviewer/Disclosed Author", press "Save". "This is not a
   valid integer." appears under the deadline, "Please correct one error."
   beside "Save" at the foot of the form and the page notice "The form was
   not saved because 1 error(s) were encountered. Please correct these errors and try
   again."; "Save" is greyed out. Reload and open "Setup" again: the
   deadline reads 4 and the review mode reads "Anonymous
   Reviewer/Anonymous Author". Repeat with `-1`: the refusal under the box
   reads "This must be at least 0.". <sup>s2</sup>

3. **Unsaved edits survive a tab switch, not a reload**: Journal Manager:
   on "Setup", change "Default Response Deadline" to 6, press the "Reviewer
   Guidance" side tab without saving and come back to "Setup": no warning
   appeared and the box still reads 6. Reload the page and open "Setup"
   again: no prompt appeared and the box reads 4. <sup>s3</sup>

4. **Guidance reaches the reviewer**: Journal Manager: on "Reviewer
   Guidance", type "Judge the method first." into "Review Guidelines" and
   "Declare any funding link." into "Competing Interests", press "Save".
   Reviewer (with an open request on the submission): open the request;
   step 1 shows a "Competing Interests" block with the choices "I do not
   have any competing interests" and "I may have competing interests
   (Specify below)", and its link "Competing Interests" opens a window
   reading "Declare any funding link."; press "OK", accept, and step 2
   shows "Reviewer Guidelines" then "Judge the method first.". <sup>s4</sup>

5. **The guidelines box per app**: Journal Manager: on "Reviewer Guidance",
   the guideline box reads "Review Guidelines" on a journal; on a press two
   boxes read "Internal Review Guidelines" and "External Review Guidelines",
   in that order [OMP2](#omp2). Tick "Present a link to how to ensure all
   files are anonymized during upload", press "Save", reload and open
   "Reviewer Guidance" again: the box stays ticked. Press the words "how to
   ensure all files are anonymized": a window "How to ensure all files are
   anonymized" opens; "Close" closes it. <sup>s5</sup>

6. **Build a review form and offer it**: Journal Manager: on "Review
   Forms", press "Create Review Form", type "Method check" as "Title" and
   press "Save": the window closes, the page shows "Your changes have been
   saved." and the list has a row "Method check" with "In Review" 0,
   "Completed" 0 and "Active" unticked. Open the row's "Edit" › "Form
   Items" › "Create New Item": type "Is the method sound?" as "Item", tick
   "Reviewers required to complete item", choose "Radio buttons (you can
   only choose one)", add "Yes" and "No" under "Response Options", "Save".
   Add a second item "Other remarks" of type "Extended text box". "Preview
   Form" shows the title, "Is the method sound?" followed by "*" with two
   radio buttons and "Other remarks" with a text box. Close the window.
   Open the submission's "Add Reviewer": it has no "Review Form" list. Tick
   "Active" on the row and press "OK" in the "Confirm" window; "Add
   Reviewer" now has a "Review Form" list with "None / Free Form Review"
   and "Method check". <sup>s6</sup>

7. **A form in use is frozen**: Journal Manager, on a journal whose active
   form "Method check" is carried by one open request: the row reads "In
   Review" 1 and offers "Copy" and "Preview" but no "Edit" and no "Delete".
   "Preview" opens a window headed "Preview" on "Preview Form" with
   "Review Form" and "Form Items" greyed out. Press "Copy" and "OK": "Your
   changes have been saved." shows, a second, unticked "Method check" row
   appears at the bottom with "Edit" and "Delete" offered, and its "Edit"
   › "Form Items" lists the same items. <sup>s7</sup>

8. **Deactivate and delete an unused form**: Journal Manager: on an active
   form nobody carries, untick "Active", read "Are you sure you wish to
   deactivate this review form? It will no longer be available for new
   review assignments." and press "OK": "Your changes have been saved."
   shows, the tick is gone and, with no other active form, the submission's
   "Add Reviewer" has no "Review Form" list. Open the row's "Delete", press
   "OK" on "Are you sure you wish to delete this review form?": the row is
   gone. <sup>s8</sup>

9. **Add and retire a recommendation** {OJS}: Journal Manager: on
   "Reviewer Recommendations" the table lists "Accept Submission",
   "Revisions Required", "Resubmit for Review", "Resubmit Elsewhere",
   "Decline Submission" and "See Comments", all ticked. Press "Add
   Recommendation", type "Accept with minor changes", choose "Approved",
   leave "Active Upon Saving", press "Save": the window closes and the row
   appears last, ticked. Untick "See Comments" and press "Yes" on "Are you
   sure you want to deactivate the recommendation See Comments": the row
   is unticked (whether it stays put or drops to the bottom is not fixed
   ⚠ [A7](#a7)). Reviewer (accepted request on the submission): step 3's
   "Recommendation" list ends with "Accept with minor changes" and has no
   "See Comments". <sup>s9</sup>

10. **A recommendation in use loses its menu** {OJS}: Journal Manager, after
    a reviewer submitted a review recommending "Accept with minor changes":
    that row has no "More Actions" menu, while an unused custom row still
    offers "Edit" and "Delete"; "Delete" › "Yes" on the unused row removes
    it. <sup>s10</sup>

11. **No review settings on a preprint server** {OPS}: Preprint Server
    Manager: Settings › Workflow shows the tabs "Submission", "Preprint
    Server Library", "Emails" and "Tasks and Discussions" and no "Review"
    tab; the same screen on the seeded journal and press shows "Review"
    between "Submission" and the library tab (the positive control).
    <sup>s11</sup>

## Findings register

Verdicts are the author's judgment (claude, 2026-09-06), unreviewed unless

### All apps

<a id="a1"></a>
**A1 — The after-due reminder needs an earlier reminder** · 🐞 · latent.
The "Review Request Response - After Due Date" and "Review Submission -
After Due Date" sliders read as independent clocks. They are not: the
install sends an after-due reminder only when the assignment already
carries a "Reminder" date, which the "Before Due Date" clock or an editor's
"Send Reminder" stamps. A journal that sets only the after-due sliders gets
no automatic reminder at all. Latent on the test installs, where the daily
clock is off, so no screen shows it. Basis: code. <sup>f-a1</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — Deactivating a form in use** · ❓ · minor.
Ticking "Active" warns "Once it's assigned to a review you will no longer
be able to deactivate it.", yet the tick on a form in use still toggles and
the deactivation goes through with "Your changes have been saved."; the
reviewers who carry the form keep it on their wizard's step 3, and only new
requests lose the option (with no other active form, Add Reviewer loses
its "Review Form" list). Question: is the deactivation of a form in use
intended (the warning is wrong) or should the tick be locked (the code is
wrong)? Lean: intended, since nothing breaks for the assignments that
carry it, and the warning text should change. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a2</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — Zero weeks means three for one deadline and four for the other** · ❓ · minor.
"Default Response Deadline" and "Default Completion Deadline" both accept 0
and both accept an emptied box (saved blank). Add Reviewer then presets the
response due date three weeks out and the review due date four weeks out,
while the settings screen shows 0 or nothing and says nothing about a
fallback. Question: should 0 and empty be refused, or should the fallbacks
be shown? Lean: refuse them with a message that the box must be at least
1, since no reviewer can answer in zero weeks. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a3</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — A reload forgets the open tab** · ❓ · minor.
Pressing "Review" and then a side tab changes the page address as if the
tab were remembered, but a reload of that address lands on "Submission" ›
"Disable Submissions": a manager who reloads after a save has to find the
side tab again. Question: is the side tab meant to survive a reload? Lean:
yes, and this is a defect, since the screen writes the address and then
ignores it. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a4</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — A type change drops the answer options silently** · 🐞 · minor.
An item's "Response Options" rows stay listed when "Item type" is changed
to a text type, and "Save" then discards them with no warning; the app
carries the warning "Changing the form item type..." for exactly this
change, and it never shows. A manager who switches a choice item to a text
box and back has to retype every option. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a5</sup>

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — A deactivated recommendation reads "-" in the editor's window** · ❓ · user-visible.
When a recommendation is deactivated after a reviewer submitted a review
with it, the Reviewers table still prints it under the reviewer's status
and the editor's "Read Review" window still lists "Recommendation:
{title}" among its lines at the top, but the window's "Reviewer
Recommendation" section prints "-"; reactivating the entry makes the
section print the title again. The window contradicts itself: the editor
reads the recommendation at the top and none in the section meant for it.
Question: should the window show a recommendation whose entry is inactive?
Lean: yes, and this is a defect, since the review carries it and the table
and the window's own line show it. Basis: probe.
<sup>f-a6</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — Recommendation order is not fixed** · ❓ · minor.
The "Reviewer Recommendations" table and the reviewer's "Recommendation"
list have no fixed order. A new entry has always appeared last, but after
an edit or a tick the changed row sometimes stays where it is and
sometimes drops to the bottom, and the same steps give either on different
runs; there is no control to order the list. Question: should the table
and the reviewer's list have a fixed order (creation order, or one the
manager sets)? Lean: yes, and this is a defect, since a manager cannot
rely on where a row will be after a tick. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a7</sup>

<a id="a8"></a>
**A8 — Declined requests do not count as use** · ❓ · minor.
"In Review" and "Completed" skip declined requests, so a form whose only
requests were declined reads 0 / 0 and offers "Edit", "Copy", "Preview"
and "Delete" like a fresh one. Deleting it drops the form from the
declined request: its "Edit" window then shows "None / Free Form Review".
Question: intended? Lean: intended; a declined request holds no answers,
so nothing is lost. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a8</sup>

<a id="a9"></a>
**A9 — The "Edit" window drops a deactivated form** · 🐞 · minor.
When a form carried by an open request is deactivated, the reviewer
row's "More Actions" › "Edit" window opens with "None / Free Form Review"
selected and lists only the still-active forms, with no sign of the form
the request carries. "OK" with nothing changed detaches it: the
reviewer's step 3 shows the free-text boxes instead of the questions and
the form's "In Review" count drops by one. Expected: the window shows the
carried form and "OK" leaves it alone. Basis: probe. <sup>f-a9</sup>

### OMP

<a id="omp1"></a>
**OMP1 — No "Reviewer Recommendations" tab on a press** · ✅ · —.
A press's "Review" tab has "Setup", "Reviewer Guidance" and "Review Forms"
only. A press collects no reviewer recommendation (the reviewer's wizard on
a press has no "Recommendation" list), so there is nothing to configure.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-omp1</sup>

<a id="omp2"></a>
**OMP2 — Press wording and the second guideline box** · ✅ · —.
On a press, the library tab reads "Press Library" (journal: "Publisher
Library"), "Restrict File Access" reads "Reviewers will have access to the
submission file only after agreeing to review it.", the completion
deadline's help reads "Weeks allowed for review completion", the "Review
Response Overdue (Automated)" email's subject reads "Manuscript Review
Request" (journal: "Will you be able to review this for us?"), and
"Reviewer Guidance" shows "Internal Review Guidelines" above "External
Review Guidelines" instead of a single "Review Guidelines"; the internal
text goes to Internal Reviewers, the external one to External Reviewers,
and the one "Competing Interests" text to both. Basis: probe.
<sup>f-omp2</sup>

<a id="omp3"></a>
**OMP3 — The internal guidelines box has a smaller toolbar** · 🐞 · minor.
On a press, "Internal Review Guidelines" offers Bold, Italic, Superscript,
Subscript and Insert/edit link only, while "External Review Guidelines"
and "Competing Interests" on the same form also offer Blockquote, Bullet
list and Numbered list: a manager can type a list or a quote into the
external guidelines and not into the internal ones. Basis: probe.
<sup>f-omp3</sup>

## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — The screen is `lib/pkp/templates/management/workflow.tpl`, rendered
by `ManagementHandler::workflow()` (lib/pkp `pages/management/`) and the
app's `SettingsHandler::workflow()`; the "Review" tab is wrapped in
`{if $hasReviewStage}`, computed by `ManagementHandler::hasReviewStage()`
from `Application::getApplicationStages()` (OJS: submission, external
review, editing, production; OMP adds internal review; OPS: production
only). Side tabs: `reviewSetup` (`PKPReviewSetupForm::FORM_REVIEW_SETUP`),
`reviewerGuidance` (`PKPReviewGuidanceForm::FORM_REVIEW_GUIDANCE`),
`reviewForms` (`ReviewFormGridHandler` fetched into
`reviewFormGridContainer`) and, under `{if $hasCustomizableRecommendation}`,
`reviewerRecommendations` (`<reviewer-recommendation-manager>`). Both Vue
forms PUT to the context API (`contexts/{id}`, the app's
`ContextController`) and are validated by the context schema
(`lib/pkp/schemas/context.json`, the app's `schemas/context.json` on top).
Labels: `manager.workflow.title` "Workflow Settings",
`manager.publication.reviewStage` "Review", `navigation.setup` "Setup",
`manager.publication.reviewerGuidance` "Reviewer Guidance",
`manager.reviewForms` "Review Forms", `manager.reviewerRecommendations`
"Reviewer Recommendations" (OJS `locale/en/manager.po`); the library tab is
`manager.publication.library` as each app's locale renders it ("Publisher
Library", "Press Library", "Preprint Server Library"), the last tab
`manager.template.tasksAndDiscussions` "Tasks and Discussions". Live-probed
2026-09-05 (Rule 1; OJS and OMP, `manager.maya` and a scratch manager):
heading, tab and side-tab names as quoted. The address: pressing "Review"
writes `#review`, a side tab writes a one-part hash (`#reviewSetup`,
`#reviewerGuidance`, …) that replaces it; a reload on `#reviewSetup` lands
on "Submission" › "Disable Submissions" on both apps (finding A4), while a
typed `#review/reviewSetup` opens "Review" › "Setup" directly. The tabs are
`<tabs :track-history="true">` wrappers.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — OPS: `ops classes/core/Application.php::getApplicationStages()`
returns production only, so `$hasReviewStage` is false and the template
skips the whole tab; `ops pages/management/SettingsHandler.php::workflow()`
adds nothing review-related. OMP: `omp classes/core/Application.php::
hasCustomizableReviewerRecommendation()` returns false (OJS true, OPS
false), which hides the recommendations tab; `omp
classes/components/forms/context/ReviewGuidanceForm.php` adds the
`internalReviewGuidelines` box before `reviewGuidelines`, whose label the
OMP locale overrides to "External Review Guidelines"
(`manager.setup.reviewGuidelines` in `omp locale/en/manager.po`; OJS
"Review Guidelines"). The OPS tab names quoted in the absence paragraph are
the template's remaining tabs (`manager.publication.submissionStage`,
`manager.publication.library`, `manager.publication.emails`,
`manager.template.tasksAndDiscussions`). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (absence
paragraph, OMP1, OMP2, scenario 11): OPS `manager.maya` sees "Submission",
"Preprint Server Library", "Emails", "Tasks and Discussions" and no
"Review"; the seeded journal and press show "Review" second; the press's
"Review" has three side tabs and the word "Recommendation" appears nowhere
on it.

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — Access: the settings page is `ManagementHandler` with
`CanAccessSettingsPolicy` (permit for `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN`, and for
`ROLE_ID_MANAGER` groups whose `permitSettings` flag is set; both seeded
manager-level groups, "Journal manager" and "Journal editor", carry
`permitSettings="true"` in `registry/userGroups.xml`, OJS and OMP alike).
The grids (`ReviewFormGridHandler`, `ReviewFormElementsGridHandler`,
`ReviewFormElementResponseItemListbuilderHandler` through
`SetupListbuilderHandler`) assign their ops to `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` and
`ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN` and add the same policy. The forms' PUT goes through
the context API's own manager gate. "Edit" and "Delete" on a form: `
ReviewFormGridRow::initialize()` adds them only when
`getIncompleteCount() == 0 && getCompleteCount() == 0`; the elements grid's
`updateReviewFormElement`/`deleteReviewFormElement` refuse a form that
`ReviewFormDAO::unusedReviewFormExists()` does not report as unused. The
recommendation manager (`ReviewerRecommendationManager.vue`) renders the
row menu only for `item.removable`, and the OJS API
(`api/v1/reviewers/recommendations/ReviewerRecommendationController.php`)
refuses `edit` and `delete` on a non-removable entry with 406. Live-probed
2026-09-06 (Actors rows 1–5; OJS, OMP and OPS, one account per level:
`manager.maya`, `editor.diana`, `admin`, `sectioneditor.ana`,
`assistant.rita`, `reviewer.julia`, `author.alex`, `reader.rosa`): the three
manager-level accounts have the collapsed "Settings" group (expanded: OJS
"Journal", "Website", "Workflow", "Distribution", "Users & Roles"; "Press"
on OMP, "Server" on OPS) and reach the page by the typed address
`{journal}/management/settings/workflow`; the others have no "Settings" in
their sidebar and the typed address redirects to
`{journal}/en/user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.roleBasedAccessDenied`
(final status 200) reading "The current role does not have access to this
operation."; `reader.rosa` lands on `{journal}/en/index` after the
journal's login. On OPS `sectioneditor.ana` (Moderator) is denied the same
way. `editor.diana` and `admin` are offered "Create Review Form" and, on a
scratch context's inactive form, "Edit", "Copy", "Preview", "Delete".

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — `PKPReviewSetupForm` (lib/pkp `classes/components/forms/context/`):
`defaultReviewMode` radio (`manager.setup.reviewOptions.reviewMode`;
options `editor.submissionReview.doubleAnonymous` = 2 "Anonymous
Reviewer/Anonymous Author", `.anonymous` = 1 "Anonymous Reviewer/Disclosed
Author", `.open` = 3 "Open"; schema default 2);
`defaultReviewPublicVisibility` checkbox (`publicReviewerComments.show`,
`.label`, `.description`) whose single option carries `'value' => false`
(finding A3); `restrictReviewerFileAccess` (`.restrictReviewerFileAccess`,
`.description`; the OMP locale overrides the description);
`reviewerAccessKeysEnabled` (`.reviewerAccessKeysEnabled`, `.label`,
`.description`); `reviewerSuggestionEnabled`, added by
`addReviewSuggestionControl()` after the one-click box when the app's
context schema has the property (OJS and OMP do);
`numWeeksPerResponse` (`defaultReviewResponseTime` "Default Response
Deadline", help `numWeeksPerResponse`), `numWeeksPerReview`
(`defaultReviewCompletionTime` "Default Completion Deadline", help
`numWeeksPerReview`, which OJS overrides to "Weeks allowed to complete the
review"; lib/pkp and OMP "Weeks allowed for review completion"),
`numReviewsPerSubmission` ("Minimum Confirmed Reviews Required"), all
`FieldText` size small; schema: integer, `nullable`, `min:0`, defaults 4,
4, 0, so the API's validator answers `validator.integer` "This is not a
valid integer." and `validator.min.numeric` "This must be at least 0.".
The four `FieldSlider`s: min 0, max 14, `minLabel` "None", `valueLabel`
"{$value} days before due date" / "{$value} days after due date",
`valueLabelMin` "No reminder set"; schema integer `min:0` with no default.
Effects: `ReviewerForm::initData()` (lib/pkp
`controllers/grid/users/reviewer/form/`) presets `reviewMethod` from
`defaultReviewMode` (double-anonymous when unset) and
`isReviewPubliclyVisible` from `Context::getDefaultReviewPublicVisibility()`;
`EditorAction::addReviewer()` stores the visibility flag on the assignment;
`reviewerFormFooter.tpl` and the assignment's `editReviewForm.tpl` carry
the box under `manager.setup.reviewOptions.publicReviewerComments.show`.
`reviewerSuggestionEnabled` is read by `PKPSubmissionHandler` (the wizard
step) and `PKPSelectReviewerListPanel` / `PKPDashboardHandler` (the
suggestions panel). Rule 2's refusal shape (`form.errorOne` "Please
correct one error.", `form.errorMany`, `form.errorGoTo` "Go to {label}:
{message}", `form.errorNext` "Jump to next error") is the shared Vue
form's; the page notice is `form.errors` "The form was not saved because
{count} error(s) were encountered. Please correct these errors and try
again." raised on the `400`; the "Saving"/"Saved" text is the form's
`role="status"` footer; live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 2, scenario 2; OJS and
OMP): the `form.errorGoTo` buttons sit in a screen-reader-only list
(`ul.-screenReader`) and are never visible, the summary and "Jump to next
error" render at the foot beside "Save" (`.pkpFormErrors`), and the badge
sits directly under the box (label, help, box, badge). The email "Your
review assignment has been changed for {journal}", sent when the editor
changes an assignment's dates, links the plain
`reviewer/submission?submissionId=…` address with no key; only requests and
reminders carry the one-click `invitation/accept?id=N&key=…` link
(live-probed 2026-09-06, Rule 5; OJS and OMP). Live-probed 2026-09-05
(Rules 2, 3, 4, 6, 8; Fields "Setup"; OJS and OMP, `manager.maya` read-only on the seeded contexts and a
scratch manager on scratch contexts): every label, help text, option and
default as quoted; `abc`, `-1` and `2.5` refused in both number boxes with
the strings quoted and a `400`, the "Open" radio chosen in the same edit
not saved; an emptied deadline saved blank, an emptied minimum saved as
"0"; a successful save answered `200` with no page notice and "Saved" gone
after 5 s; a side-tab switch with edits kept them (no dialog recorded), a
reload showed the saved values (no `beforeunload` prompt). Finding A3 of
the draft (the public-visibility tick) did not hold: the tick survived
"Save" and a reload on both apps, Add Reviewer's box arrived ticked, and
the earlier request's "Edit Review" window kept its unticked box. "Minimum
Confirmed Reviews Required" 1 printed "Minimum number of confirmed reviews
required: 1." above "Awaiting responses from reviewers." (the accepted
state) and 0 removed the line; live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 8; OJS and
OMP): the first line stayed after the review was submitted ("New reviews
have been submitted." under it) and after "Read Review", and after Read
Review › "Mark as Complete" › "Mark this review as complete?" › "Mark as
Complete" the second line read "Minimum required number of reviews have
been confirmed. A decision is needed." with the row at "Complete". The
suggestion box added the wizard step "5 Reviewer Suggestions" before "6
Review" on both apps; with the box on and no suggestion entered, nothing
on the review stage or in Add Reviewer mentions suggestions (2026-09-06),
and the editors' side with a suggestion entered was not driven here. When
"Save" is re-enabled after a refusal was not driven.

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — `PKPReviewGuidanceForm`: `reviewGuidelines` and
`competingInterests` are multilingual `FieldRichTextarea`s (toolbar bold,
italic, super/subscript, link, blockquote, lists); `showEnsuringLink` is a
`FieldShowEnsuringLink` (extends `FieldOptions`; option label
`manager.setup.reviewOptions.showAnonymousReviewLink`, whose `<button>` the
Vue field turns into the dialog `review.anonymousPeerReview.title` "How to
ensure all files are anonymized" with the body `review.anonymousPeerReview`
and "OK"). Effects: the reviewer wizard's step 2 and step 3 link
(`PKPReviewerReviewStep2Form`, `step3.tpl`) and the step-1 competing
interests section (`PKPReviewerReviewStep1Form`), owned by the
reviewer's-review spec; the upload window's link:
`PKPSubmissionFilesUploadBaseForm::fetch()` adds the `ensuringLink`
`LinkAction` (a `ConfirmationModal` with the same title and text) when
`showEnsuringLink` is on and the stage is submission, internal review or
external review. Form languages: `ManagementHandler::getSupportedFormLocales()`
feeds the forms' `locales`; the seeded and scratch contexts have `en` as
their only form locale (seed-facts.md). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 16,
Fields "Reviewer Guidance"; OJS and OMP, a scratch context with French
ticked under "Forms" in Settings › Website › Setup › Languages): the form
gained the "French"/"English" switch at its top and no box gained a tab,
each box read "0/2 languages completed" while empty, "French" revealed
"Review Guidelines in French" (OMP "Internal Review Guidelines in French",
…) under the English box, "Setup" gained no language control, and the
French guidance reached a reviewer reading the wizard in French; the
French "Forms" box was unticked on the fresh scratch context, so the
one-language premise holds. Live-probed 2026-09-05 (Rules 10,
11; Fields "Reviewer Guidance"; OJS and OMP, scratch contexts with a
throwaway manager, an external reviewer and, on OMP, an internal reviewer;
a second untouched context as the control): box labels and order as
quoted, no help text; the words are a `<button>` inside the label and the
window's only control is the header "Close"; the typed guidance and policy
reached the reviewer's steps 1, 2 and 3 with the strings quoted in Rule
10, the control context showed none of them; the upload windows of the
Submission and Review stages ("Upload Submission File", "Upload Review
File") carried the link only with the box on, opening the same text with
"OK" and "Cancel"; on OMP the internal box reached the internal round's
reviewer and the external box the external round's.

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — Grid: `ReviewFormGridHandler` (lib/pkp
`controllers/grid/settings/reviewForms/`): title `manager.reviewForms`,
action `createReviewForm` ("Create Review Form", `AjaxModal`), columns
`name` ("Title"), `inReview` ("In Review", `getIncompleteCount()`),
`completed` ("Completed", `getCompleteCount()`), `active`
(`selectStatusCell.tpl`, a checkbox whose click runs the
`activateReviewForm`/`deactivateReviewForm` `RemoteActionConfirmationModal`
with `manager.reviewForms.confirmActivate` / `confirmDeactivate`);
`initFeatures()` adds `OrderGridItemsFeature` ("Order",
`grid.action.order`; finish controls `common.done` "Done" and
`grid.action.cancelOrdering` "Cancel ordering"); rows ordered by `seq`
(`ReviewFormDAO::getByAssocId()`, `getActiveByAssocId()` `ORDER BY rf.seq`).
The counts: `ReviewFormDAO` sub-selects on `review_assignments` with
`declined <> 1`, split on `date_completed`. Row actions
(`ReviewFormGridRow`): `edit` and `delete` under `$canEdit` (both counts
0), `copy` (`manager.reviewForms.confirmCopy`), `preview` (the edit op with
`preview=1`). `editReviewForm()` renders
`controllers/grid/settings/reviewForms/editReviewForm.tpl`: tabs
`manager.reviewForms.edit` "Review Form", `manager.reviewFormElements` "Form
Items", `manager.reviewForms.preview` "Preview Form"; `{if !$canEdit}
disabled: [0, 1]{/if}` and `selected: {if $preview}2{else}0{/if}`.
`ReviewFormForm` (`manager/reviewForms/reviewFormForm.tpl`): `title`
required (`FormValidatorLocale`, `manager.reviewForms.form.titleRequired`),
`description` rich, both multilingual; a new form gets `active = 0` and
`REALLY_BIG_NUMBER` then resequenced. `copyReviewForm()` inserts the form
inactive at the end and copies every element; `deleteReviewForm()` requires
both counts 0 (and clears `reviewFormId` on any assignment, moot by then);
`deactivateReviewForm()` checks only `getActive()` (finding A2). Every
mutating op ends in `NotificationManager::createTrivialNotification()`
("Your changes have been saved.") and a `DataChangedEvent` that redraws
the grid; the ordering feature's `saveSequence` raises no notification. Items: `ReviewFormElementsGridHandler`
(title "Form Items", action `createReviewFormElement` "Create New Item",
column `question` "Item" capped at 220 characters of text, ordering
feature); `ReviewFormElementGridRow` adds `edit` and `delete`
(`manager.reviewFormElements.confirmDelete`); `ReviewFormElementForm`
(`manager/reviewForms/reviewFormElementForm.tpl`): `question` required
(`questionRequired`), `description`, `required`, `included` (default 1 on a
new item), `elementType` required (`elementTypeRequired`; options
`ReviewFormElement::getReviewFormElementTypeOptions()`: 1 "Single word text
box", 2 "Single line text box", 3 "Extended text box", 4 "Checkboxes (you
can choose one or more)", 5 "Radio buttons (you can only choose one)", 6
"Drop-down box"), the listbuilder
`ReviewFormElementResponseItemListbuilderHandler` (title
`grid.reviewFormElement.responseItems` "Response Options", column
`manager.reviewFormElements.possibleResponse` "Selection", "Add Item")
enabled by `togglePossibleResponses()` for the three multiple-response
types, with the `alert()` `manager.reviewFormElement.changeType`; on save a
non-choice type stores `possibleResponses = null`. Preview:
`PreviewReviewForm` renders `manager/reviewForms/previewReviewForm.tpl`
(title, description, then `reviewer/review/reviewFormResponse.tpl`, the
same template the wizard's step 3 uses; a required item gets the section's
required mark). OMP still ships an unused legacy
`templates/controllers/grid/settings/reviewForm/previewReviewForm.tpl`
(mock inputs per type) that nothing renders. Effects of `included`:
`PKPReviewController::getReviewFormResponses()` `authorFriendly`,
`reviewDownload.tpl` `authorFriendly`, and the decision email's
`ReviewerComments` mail trait skip elements with `getIncluded()` false;
`required` is enforced by `ReviewFormElementDAO::getRequiredReviewFormElementIds()`
in the wizard's step 3. Live-probed 2026-09-05 (Rules 12–15; Fields "Review
Forms"; OJS and OMP, scratch contexts with a throwaway manager, and
submissions in review with an accepted and a declined reviewer where the
counts were read): the empty list and the empty items list both read the
generic "No Items" (`grid.noItems`), never the locale's own empty strings;
the windows are headed "Create Review Form", "Edit" (form and item alike),
"Preview", "Create New Item"; every save and every confirmed action showed the page notice "Your
changes have been saved." (`common.changesSaved`) and the form window
closed on its own save; the confirmations are page windows headed
"Confirm" with "OK" / "Cancel"; a copy kept the title verbatim and the
items in the source's current order; ordering's "Done" showed no notice;
the counts read 1 / 0 with one accepted and one declined assignment and
0 / 1 after the review was submitted; the in-use row offered "Copy",
"Preview" only, its "Preview" window opened on "Preview Form" with the two
other tabs `ui-state-disabled` and inert; the item with `included` off was
absent from the author's "Review: {title}" window and present in the
editor's "Review Details: {title}" window with its "Download Review Form"
button; a journal section's "Edit" window listed the active form only and
its choice preselected the form in Add Reviewer, while a press series
window has no "Review Form" list. Add Reviewer showed no "Review Form"
`select` at all while no form was active (`ReviewerForm::fetch()` renders
the list only with active forms). The listbuilder's "Add Item" is a plain
link never disabled, the `select` carries no `onchange`, so
`togglePossibleResponses()` and its `alert()` never run (finding A5); no
column header row is rendered. In the preview, "Single word text box" and
"Single line text box" are both `<input type="text">`; the required mark
is `<span class="req">*</span>` after the question and the description a
paragraph before the control. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Fields "Review
Forms", Rules 12, 14, 15, 16; OJS and OMP): "Order" is present but hidden
on the empty and the one-row forms list and on the empty items list, and
appears with the second form (an items list with exactly one item was not
observed); the empty "Title" and the unchosen "Item type" are refused in
the browser with "This field is required." (`form.required`), so
`titleRequired` and `elementTypeRequired` are never reached through the
screen, while an empty "Item" with a type chosen reaches the server's
`questionRequired` notice "A question is required for the form item.
(English)" with nothing under the box (whether that notice is the page bar
or sits inside the window was not settled: it was gone four seconds
later); a completed review's "Edit" window had no "Review Form" list with
an active form present, while a review in progress had the list with its
own form selected; the required item let "Submit Review" and its "Are you
sure you want to submit this review?" confirmation run, then step 3 stayed
with "This field is required." under the item; with French ticked under
"Forms", "Title" and a "Response Options" row gained a "(French)" twin
(`title[fr_CA]`, `newRowId[possibleResponse][fr_CA]`) and each rich-text box a
"French" editor, hidden until the English box was focused, the toolbar's
globe icon revealing nothing, and a reviewer reading the wizard in French
saw the French item text with the untranslated title, description, items
and options in English.

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — OJS only. `ojs pages/management/SettingsHandler::
addReviewFormWorkflowSupport()` builds `ReviewerRecommendationsListPanel`
(`ojs classes/components/listPanels/`) with the entries of
`ReviewerRecommendation::query()->withContextId()`, and assigns
`hasCustomizableRecommendation`. The Vue manager
`lib/ui-library/src/managers/ReviewerRecommendationManager/
ReviewerRecommendationManager.vue` with `reviewerRecommendationManagerStore.js`
and `ReviewerRecommendationsEditModal.vue`: button
`grid.action.addReviewerRecommendation` "Add Recommendation"; columns
`manager.reviewerRecommendations.list.name.title` "Recommendations" and
`.list.status.title` "Activate"; the row checkbox is `:checked="item.status"`
with a `click.prevent` that opens the dialog
(`manager.reviewerRecommendations.activate.title` / `deactivate.title`,
messages `confirmActivate` / `confirmDeactivate`, `common.yes` /
`common.no`) and then `PUT reviewers/recommendations/{id}/status`;
`DropdownActions` (label `common.moreActions` "More Actions") only
`v-if="item.removable"`, with `common.edit` and `common.delete` (the delete
dialog: `grid.action.deleteReviewerRecommendation` "Delete Recommendation",
`manager.reviewerRecommendations.confirmDelete`); add/edit open the side
modal titled "Add Recommendation" / `grid.action.editReviewerRecommendation`
"Edit Recommendation" over `ReviewerRecommendationForm`
(`ojs classes/components/forms/context/`): `title` required multilingual
(`manager.reviewerRecommendations.title.label`, help `.title.description`),
`type` required `FieldSelect` over
`Repo::reviewerRecommendation()->getRecommendationTypeLabels()` (1
"Approved", 2 "Not Approved", 3 "Revisions Requested", 4 "With Comments"),
`status` `FieldSelect` with no label (1 "Active Upon Saving", 0
"Deactivate", value 1). API (`ReviewerRecommendationController`, base
`reviewers/recommendations`): GET, GET {id}, POST, PUT {id}, PUT
{id}/status, DELETE {id}; `removable` is
`!Repo::reviewAssignment()->…->filterByReviewerRecommendationIds([$id])->exists()`.
Defaults: `ContextService::afterAddContext` calls
`Repo::reviewerRecommendation()->addDefaultRecommendations()`, six rows
from `reviewer.article.decision.accept` ("Accept Submission"),
`.pendingRevisions` ("Revisions Required"), `.resubmitHere` ("Resubmit for
Review"), `.resubmitElsewhere` ("Resubmit Elsewhere"), `.decline` ("Decline
Submission"), `.seeComments` ("See Comments"), `status` 1, titled in every
supported locale. The reviewer's list:
`Repository::getRecommendationOptions()` returns the active entries plus
the one the assignment already carries, consumed by
`PKPReviewerReviewStep3Form`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 17, 18; Fields
"Reviewer Recommendations"; OJS scratch context with a throwaway manager
and an accepted external reviewer): the table, the six defaults, the
dialogs and the reviewer's list as quoted; "Recommendation type" is a
`select` with no selected option and the status list a `select`; an empty
save is refused in the browser with "This field is required." under both
required boxes and "Please correct 2 errors." at the foot (no request
sent), "Save" then `[disabled]` until every error is cleared, and with one
box empty the foot reads "Please correct one error." (live-probed
2026-09-06); with French ticked under "Forms" the window gains the
"French"/"English" switch and a second box "Review Recommendations in
French" (`title-fr_CA`) behind "French"; add is `POST reviewers/recommendations`, edit a `POST …/{id}`, both
redrawing the table with no notice; the rows are listed by
`ReviewerRecommendation::query()->withContextId()->get()` with no
ordering, so the table shows whatever order the database returns: in this
probe an edited or toggled row dropped to the bottom, on later drives the
same day it stayed in place (finding A7, footnote f-a7), and the
reviewer's `select` followed the table either way; the type appears in no
window the editor or the reviewer opens.
The in-use entry lost its "More Actions" cell after the submit; deactivated,
the Reviewers table's status cell still printed it ("Review Submitted",
and "Review Viewed" once the review had been opened) while "Read Review" /
"Review Details" kept its "Recommendation:" summary line and printed "-"
in its "Reviewer Recommendation" section; reactivated, the section printed
the title again (finding A6; re-read 2026-09-06).

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `HasReviewDueDate` trait (lib/pkp
`controllers/grid/users/reviewer/form/traits/`):
`getReviewResponseDueDate()` is `Carbon::today()->endOfDay()->addWeeks(n)`
with `n = numWeeksPerResponse`, falling back to
`REVIEW_RESPONSE_DEFAULT_DUE_WEEKS = 3` when the setting is 0 or empty;
`getReviewSubmitDueDate()` the same with `numWeeksPerReview` and
`REVIEW_SUBMIT_DEFAULT_DUE_WEEKS = 4` (finding A4). `ReviewerForm::
initData()` calls `getDueDates($context)` for the Add Reviewer window;
the one-click invitation's lifetime is `(numWeeksPerReview + 4) * 7` days
(`ReviewerAccessInvite::getExpiryDays()`). The scenario API's
`reviewRounds[]` builder stamps dates the same way (scenarios.md).
Live-probed 2026-09-05 (Rule 7, finding A3; OJS and OMP, scratch contexts):
with 4 / 4 both dates were today + 28 days; with 2 / 5, today + 14 and + 35;
with 0 / 0 and with both boxes emptied, today + 21 and + 28; the accepted
request's row kept "Review due: {date}" throughout.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — The clock is `PKP\task\ReviewReminder` (lib/pkp `classes/task/`),
registered `->daily()` in `ojs classes/scheduler/Scheduler.php` and `omp
classes/scheduler/Scheduler.php` (OPS registers none). It iterates
`Repo::reviewAssignment()->getCollector()->filterByIsIncomplete(true)`
(notified, not completed, not declined, not cancelled), skips submissions
whose status is not `STATUS_QUEUED`, and reads the four `numDays…` settings
per context. With `dateConfirmed` null and `dateReminded` null it sends
`ReviewResponseRemindAuto` when `numDaysBeforeReviewResponseReminderDue > 0`
and the response due date is ahead by at most that many days; with
`dateReminded` set, when `numDaysAfterReviewResponseReminderDue > 0`, today
is past the due date by at least that many days and the last reminder
predates the due date. After confirmation the same two branches run on the
review due date with the submit thresholds and `ReviewRemindAuto`. The
"after" branch sits inside `else` of `dateReminded === null` (finding A1).
The job `PKP\jobs\email\ReviewReminder` builds the mailable from the
template (`REVIEW_RESPONSE_OVERDUE_AUTO`, name
`mailable.reviewResponseOverdueAuto.name` "Review Response Overdue
(Automated)", subject `emails.reviewResponseOverdueAuto.subject` "Will you
be able to review this for us?", which the OMP locale overrides to
"Manuscript Review Request"; `REVIEW_REMIND_AUTO`, name "Review
Reminder (Automated)", subject "A reminder to please complete your
review" on both apps; names and subjects read on the "Manage Emails" page,
reached from the "Add and edit templates" link of Settings › Workflow ›
"Emails", live-probed 2026-09-06 on OJS and OMP), from
`contactEmail`/`contactName`, mints a `ReviewerAccessInvite`
when `reviewerAccessKeysEnabled`, sends, sets `dateReminded` and
`reminderWasAutomatic`, logs the email
(`SubmissionEmailLogEventType::REVIEW_REMIND_AUTO`) and the event
(`SUBMISSION_LOG_REVIEW_REMIND_AUTO`,
`submission.event.reviewer.reviewerRemindedAuto` "An automatic reminder
email was sent to {$recipientName} regarding their review assignment").
`ReviewerAction::confirmReview()` resets `dateReminded` and
`reminderWasAutomatic` on accept or decline. The test installs run with
`[schedule] task_runner = Off` and `[queues] job_runner = Off`
(seed-facts.md), so the clock, its emails and its log row are not
observable through any screen there: Rule 9 and the reminder side effect
are read from the code, and no screen settles them.

<a id="fn-s0"></a>
**s0** — Scratch journal: `POST scenarios/context` with a throwaway
`manager`, an `externalReviewer` and an `author` in `users[]` (a seeded
reviewer is not enrolled on a scratch context, so the reviewer must be
created there), then `POST scenarios/submission` with
`decisions: ['sendExternalReview']` and `reviewRounds: [{reviewers:
[{username, status: 'accepted'}]}]` where a request is needed; `review:`
and `reviewForms[]` passthrough keys (scenarios.md "Configuring a scratch
context") seed the configured ends where a scenario starts from them
(scenario 7 seeds an active form and a reviewer carrying it through
`reviewForm:`). Access checks: the seeded journal `publicknowledge` with
`manager.maya`, `editor.diana`, `sectioneditor.ana`, `assistant.rita`,
`reviewer.julia`, `author.alex`, `reader.rosa` (passwords: the username
twice; `admin` / `admin`). Scenario 11: the seeded OPS server with
`manager.maya`; the journal and press controls with the same account.
Mail is read in the mail catcher (Mailpit, `http://127.0.0.1:8025`) though
no scenario here expects mail.

<a id="fn-s1"></a>
**s1** — Scenario 1 exercises Rules 2, 3, 7 and the sliders' saving; the
Add Reviewer read is the effect end of Rules 3 and 7 (`ReviewerForm::
initData()`). The scratch journal starts at the install defaults (seed-facts
"Settings › Workflow › Review on the seeded journal", 2026-09-04).
Live-probed 2026-09-05 in parts (footnotes d, h): the sliders set by
keyboard saved and read back after a reload; "Open" and a 2-week response
deadline reached Add Reviewer. For the test author (2026-09-06): a mouse
drag lands where the pointer is released and is not pixel-exact (a drag
from the left end read 2), so the suite sets the slider by keyboard (focus
it, Home, then ArrowRight three times) and reads "3 days before due date"
in the box beside it.

<a id="fn-s2"></a>
**s2** — Scenario 2: the context schema's `integer` and `min:0` rules and
the Vue form's per-field error rendering (footnote d). Live-probed
2026-09-05 with `abc`, `-1` and `2.5` (the decimal is refused like the
letters) in "Default Completion Deadline", the mode change in the same
edit unsaved after the refusal, both apps.

<a id="fn-s3"></a>
**s3** — Scenario 3: the Vue tab switch keeps the page and the form's
state; only a reload re-reads the saved values. Live-probed 2026-09-05 on
"Setup" (a deadline and a slider) and "Reviewer Guidance" (a guideline
text) on both apps: no dialog on the switch, values still present on
return, saved values after the reload, no `beforeunload` prompt.

<a id="fn-s4"></a>
**s4** — Scenario 4: `reviewGuidelines` and `competingInterests` saved
through the guidance form; the wizard's step 1 and 2 rendering is the
reviewer's-review spec's (`PKPReviewerReviewStep1Form`,
`PKPReviewerReviewStep2Form`). Live-probed 2026-09-05 on both apps
(footnote e). The reviewer's "Accept Review, Continue to Step #2" does
nothing until the privacy box is ticked ("This field is required." under
it otherwise).

<a id="fn-s5"></a>
**s5** — Scenario 5: `omp ReviewGuidanceForm` adds `internalReviewGuidelines`
before `reviewGuidelines`; `FieldShowEnsuringLink` (footnote e).
Live-probed 2026-09-05 on both apps: box order, the button in the sentence,
the window's "Close", the tick after "Save" and a fresh navigation.

<a id="fn-s6"></a>
**s6** — Scenario 6: `createReviewForm` → `updateReviewForm`;
`createReviewFormElement` → `updateReviewFormElement` with the listbuilder's
`possibleResponses`; `reviewFormPreview`; `activateReviewForm`; the Add
Reviewer list is `ReviewerForm::fetch()` over
`ReviewFormDAO::getActiveByAssocId()` with `manager.reviewForms.noneChosen`
"None / Free Form Review" as the empty choice, rendered only when at least
one form is active. Live-probed 2026-09-05 on both apps (footnote f): the
create, item and preview steps on one context, the activation and the Add
Reviewer list on another seeded with two inactive forms.

<a id="fn-s7"></a>
**s7** — Scenario 7: `reviewForms: [{title: 'Method check', elements: […]}]`
and a `reviewRounds[].reviewers[]` entry with `reviewForm: 'Method check'`
(scenarios.md); `getIncompleteCount()` 1 → `$canEdit` false →
`ReviewFormGridRow` without `edit`/`delete`, `editReviewForm.tpl` with tabs
0 and 1 disabled; `copyReviewForm()`. Live-probed 2026-09-05 on both apps
(footnote f): row 1 / 0, "Copy" and "Preview" only, the "Preview" window's
greyed tabs inert under a forced click, the copy at the bottom with
"Edit" / "Delete" and the same items.

<a id="fn-s8"></a>
**s8** — Scenario 8: `deactivateReviewForm` (confirmation
`manager.reviewForms.confirmDeactivate`) and `deleteReviewForm`
(`manager.reviewForms.confirmDelete`) on a form with both counts 0.
Live-probed 2026-09-05 on both apps (footnote f) with a second active form
present, so the Add Reviewer list shrank rather than vanished; the
zero-active end was read on the in-use form's deactivation (footnote
f-a2).

<a id="fn-s9"></a>
**s9** — Scenario 9 (OJS): `POST reviewers/recommendations` from the side
modal, `PUT …/status` from the tick dialog; the reviewer's list is
`Repository::getRecommendationOptions()` on step 3 (`ojs
templates/reviewer/review/reviewerRecommendations.tpl`). Live-probed
2026-09-06 (footnote g): the new entry last and ticked, "See Comments"
unticked (moved to the bottom in that run and in a second the same day;
left in place, above the new entry, on the suite's first run and on a
later 15-change drive, also 2026-09-06: finding A7), the reviewer's list
ending with the new entry and without "See Comments" either way.

<a id="fn-s10"></a>
**s10** — Scenario 10 (OJS): the submitted review stores
`reviewerRecommendationId` (`PKPReviewerReviewStep3Form::execute()`), which
makes `removable` false and hides the `DropdownActions`; the API refuses
`edit`/`delete` with 406 behind it. The submit itself follows the
reviewer's-review spec's scenario. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (footnote g): the
chosen entry's row without "More Actions", an unused custom entry deleted
through "Delete" › "Yes".

<a id="fn-s11"></a>
**s11** — Scenario 11: footnote b, live-probed 2026-09-06 on all three
apps.

<a id="fn-f-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — `PKP\task\ReviewReminder::executeActions()`: the
`numDaysAfterReviewResponseReminderDue` and
`numDaysAfterReviewSubmitReminderDue` checks live in the `else` branch of
`if ($reviewAssignment->getDateReminded() === null)`, so an assignment
never reminded is only ever considered for the "before" thresholds. The
scenario API cannot advance the clock and the task runner is off on the
fleets, so the finding is read from the code and no screen shows it; a
re-check needs a server whose scheduler runs. Since: the reminder rewrite that introduced the four
sliders (pkp-lib 3.5).

<a id="fn-f-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — `ReviewFormGridHandler::deactivateReviewForm()` tests
`$request->checkCSRF() && isset($reviewForm) && $reviewForm->getActive()`
only; `ReviewFormGridCellProvider::getCellActions()` offers the toggle on
every row; the warning is `manager.reviewForms.confirmActivate`.
Live-probed 2026-09-05 on both apps on a form carried by an accepted and a
declined assignment: the untick asked the deactivation question, "OK"
showed "Your changes have been saved.", the row read unticked and 1 / 0
after a reload, Add Reviewer on the same submission had no "Review Form"
list (it was the only form), the accepted reviewer's step 3 still showed
the form's items, and re-ticking asked the activation question again.

<a id="fn-f-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — Footnote h: `REVIEW_RESPONSE_DEFAULT_DUE_WEEKS = 3` versus
`REVIEW_SUBMIT_DEFAULT_DUE_WEEKS = 4`, against schema defaults of 4 and 4;
the schema's `nullable` lets the emptied box through. Live-probed
2026-09-05 on both apps: 0 / 0 and empty / empty both gave today + 21 and
today + 28 in Add Reviewer.

<a id="fn-f-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — Footnote a: the side tabs' `<tabs :track-history="true">` writes
a one-part hash that the page never reads back on load (only the
`#review/reviewSetup` shape it does not write is honoured). Live-probed
2026-09-05 on OJS and OMP, scratch contexts: reload on
`…/workflow#reviewSetup` selected "Submission" and "Disable Submissions"
with the hash still in the address. Candidate for `app-changes.md` if a
suite needs the tab after a reload.

<a id="fn-f-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — Footnote f: `reviewFormElementForm.tpl` defines
`togglePossibleResponses()` with the
`alert(manager.reviewFormElement.changeType)` for the type list's change
(its own comment says "onchange"), but the `{fbvElement type="select"}`
it renders carries no `onchange`, so the listbuilder is never disabled and
no warning fires; `ReviewFormElementForm::
execute()` stores `possibleResponses = null` for a text type. Live-probed
2026-09-05 on both apps: "Add Item" pressed with "Choose item type" still
selected added a row; a saved radio item with "Yes" / "No" switched to
"Extended text box" and saved showed "Your changes have been saved." and,
reopened, "No Items" under "Response Options"; `page.on('dialog')` recorded
nothing. Since: the elided warning was wired when the listbuilder was
written; the age of the missing binding was not traced.

<a id="fn-f-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — Footnote g: `Repository::getRecommendationOptions()` returns the
active entries plus the one the assignment carries, which is what the
reviewer's list shows. The editor's window is the Vue
`ReviewerManager/ReviewDetailsModal.vue` (the "Read Review" row button and
the "Review Details" menu entry open the same one); it prints the title it
finds for the assignment's `reviewerRecommendationId` in the
`recommendations` list it is handed (`useReviewerManagerConfig.js
getRecommendationString()`, null when the id is not in the list). Which
list each surface is handed was not traced. Live-probed 2026-09-06 on OJS,
twice in separate runs and read once the comments block had filled in:
with the entry deactivated the window still carried "Review Submitted:
{date}" and "Recommendation: Accept with minor changes" among its summary
lines and printed "-" in its "Reviewer Recommendation" section (help "The
reviewer's suggested outcome for this submission."); reactivated, the
section printed the title too, and the "Review Details" menu entry opened
the same window. An earlier read that saw the summary lines missing was
taken before the window had filled in. The Reviewers row's label was
"Review Submitted" until the editor opened the review and "Review Viewed"
after, the title under either. The window itself is the reviewer
assignment & management spec's surface.

<a id="fn-f-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — Footnote g: `ReviewerRecommendationController::getMany()`
(`ReviewerRecommendation::query()->withContextId()->get()`) feeds the
table and `Repository::getRecommendationOptions()` (`withActive()->get()`)
the reviewer's list; neither orders, so both show the rows as the database
returns them. Live-probed 2026-09-06 on OJS, two fresh scratch journals
with a throwaway manager and an accepted external reviewer each, 15 changes
(4 adds, 3 edits, 8 ticks), the table read after every change at once and
again after the settings page was reopened, the reviewer's step 3 list
after 11 of them: every new row last; no edited or ticked row ever moved
(creation order throughout, the same after the reopen); the reviewer's
`select` was the ticked rows in the table's order on all 11 reads. Earlier
the same day on the same install, three separate drives saw every edited
or toggled row drop to the bottom, and the OJS suite's first run saw
scenario 9's toggled row stay above the new entry. The browser's traffic
is the same each time (footnote g's add, edit and status calls, then `GET
reviewers/recommendations`, all 200) and the table is redrawn from that
GET, so the difference sits in the database's answer to an unordered query
(a lean, not an observation: a rewritten row's physical place); which of
the two a run gets is not something the tester can steer, so a test
asserts the tick and the reviewer's list, never the row's position.


<a id="fn-f-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — Live-driven 2026-09-06 on OJS from the register entry alone, on
a fresh scratch journal: a form carried by one declined request read 0 / 0
with "Edit", "Copy", "Preview" and "Delete"; after "Delete" › "OK" the
declined request's "Edit" window listed "None / Free Form Review" selected.
Editing the questions under a declined request was not driven. First seen
2026-09-05 by the earlier build of this spec.

<a id="fn-f-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — Live-driven 2026-09-06 on OJS and OMP from the register entry
alone, on a fresh scratch context each: an accepted request carrying an
active form; the form deactivated on "Review Forms" ("OK" on the
confirmation); the reviewer row's "Edit" window then listed only the
still-active forms with "None / Free Form Review" selected; "OK" unchanged
answered 200, the form's "In Review" went 1 → 0, and the reviewer's step 3
showed "For author and editor" and "For editor" instead of the questions.
The count still read 1 before the "OK", so the window's save does the
detaching. First seen 2026-09-05 by the earlier build of this spec.
<a id="fn-f-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — Footnote b (`hasCustomizableReviewerRecommendation()`); the
press wizard's missing "Recommendation" list is the reviewer's-review
spec's OMP1. Live-probed 2026-09-06 on the seeded press: three side tabs,
no "Recommendation" anywhere on the "Review" tab; the press reviewer's step
3 had no "Recommendation" list (2026-09-05).

<a id="fn-f-omp2"></a>
**f-omp2** — `omp locale/en/manager.po` overrides
`manager.setup.reviewOptions.restrictReviewerFileAccess.description` and
`manager.setup.reviewGuidelines`, and does not override
`manager.setup.reviewOptions.numWeeksPerReview` (lib/pkp wording), while
`ojs locale/en/manager.po` overrides the last one; `omp
ReviewGuidanceForm` adds `internalReviewGuidelines`
(`manager.setup.internalReviewGuidelines`); `manager.publication.library`
is "Publisher Library" in OJS and "Press Library" in OMP; the OMP locale
also overrides `emails.reviewResponseOverdueAuto.subject` to "Manuscript
Review Request" (footnote i). Live-probed 2026-09-05 on both apps
(footnotes d, e): every string as quoted; the subject read on the "Manage
Emails" page of the seeded journal and press 2026-09-06. The internal
box's toolbar is OMP3.

<a id="fn-f-omp3"></a>
**f-omp3** — Footnote e: `omp ReviewGuidanceForm` adds
`internalReviewGuidelines` as a `FieldRichTextarea` with its own toolbar
list, shorter than the one `PKPReviewGuidanceForm` gives `reviewGuidelines`
and `competingInterests`. Live-probed 2026-09-05 on one scratch press and
again on a second 2026-09-06: "Internal Review Guidelines" shows five
toolbar buttons (Bold, Italic, Superscript, Subscript, Insert/edit link);
"External Review Guidelines" and "Competing Interests" show eight (plus
Blockquote, Bullet list, Numbered list).
