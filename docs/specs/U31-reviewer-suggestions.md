# Reviewer suggestions {OJS OMP}

> Conventions (markers, badges, footnotes): [Reading a spec](GLOSSARY.md#reading-a-spec).

## Purpose

While making a submission, an author may name people they think should
review it, each with a reason. Editors see that list on the workflow screen
and, once the submission is in review, can turn a name into a real review
request in one move. The feature is off until a manager switches on
"Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" in the review settings. This spec covers
the wizard's "Reviewer Suggestions" step with its "Add Reviewer Suggestion"
window, the "Reviewer Suggestions" panel of the wizard's Review step, the
workflow screen's "Reviewers Suggested by Author" panel, and the "Select a
Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" list inside the Add Reviewer window.
<sup>a</sup>

The wizard itself is
[→ submission wizard](U21-submission-wizard.md#steps); the Add Reviewer
window and everything that follows a request are
[→ reviewer assignment & management](U27-reviewer-assignment-and-management.md#search).
<sup>p</sup>

A preprint server installs no Review settings tab, so "Reviewer Suggestion
at Submission" cannot be switched on there: its submission wizard has no
"Reviewer Suggestions" step and its workflow screen no "Reviewers Suggested
by Author" panel. <sup>a</sup>

## Actors & permissions

**Terms used below.** A **draft** is a submission the author has started and
not yet submitted (the wizard is still open on it). A **pending
suggestion** is one that has not yet been turned into a reviewer (Rule 11).
<sup>p</sup>

The **editorial roles** of this spec are Journal Manager, Editor, Site
Administrator (with or without a journal role), and Section Editor and
Guest Editor assigned to the stage (a press installs no Guest Editor role);
the Funding Coordinator, the one assistant-level role that reaches the
review stage
([→ stage access](U24-workflow-screen-and-stage-access.md#stage-access)),
is named where it differs. <sup>a</sup>

| Action | Who may, and when |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Suggest reviewers** ("Add Reviewer Suggestion", "Edit", "Delete" on the wizard step) | • Author: on their own draft, while "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" is on (Rules 2–5); after the final "Submit" no screen offers a change (Rule 7)<br>• Journal Manager: on any author's draft, the same wizard step; the Editor Dashboard's "All in submission stage" view lists the draft as "Incomplete" with one button, "Complete submission", which opens it<br>• Section Editor, another Author, Reviewer, Reader: no screen offers another's draft, and typing its address lands on the access-denied page <sup>a</sup> <sup>t1</sup> |
| **See the "Reviewers Suggested by Author" panel** (workflow screen, Submission and Review stages) | • Editorial roles: whenever the submission carries at least one suggestion to list (Rule 8)<br>• Funding Coordinator: the panel never shows; instead a dialog titled "Error", reading "The current role does not have access to this operation." with one button, "OK", opens on the stage, with or without a suggestion ⚠ [A1](#a1)<br>• Author: never; the author view carries no such panel <sup>a</sup> |
| **"Add Reviewer" from a suggestion** (the row's "…" menu on the Review stage) | • Editorial roles: while the Review stage is the submission's current stage (Rule 9); the request itself follows the Add Reviewer window's own rules (*Reviewer assignment & management*) <sup>a</sup> |
| **"Select Reviewer" on a suggestion inside the Add Reviewer window** | • Whoever opened the Add Reviewer window, while the suggestion is pending and the person is not yet on the round (Rule 10)<br>• Funding Coordinator: offered on every entry, but on a person with no account the "Create New Reviewer" form it opens does nothing when its "Add Reviewer" is pressed ⚠ [A5](#a5) <sup>a</sup> |

## Fields & validation

The "Add Reviewer Suggestion" window (also the "Edit" window, prefilled).
Its "Save" refuses the form until every required box is filled: each empty
required box shows "This field is required.", and the top of the window
lists them ("Please correct {N} errors. Go to {box}: {message}", with "Jump
to next error"). "Save" cannot be pressed again until every flagged box has
changed: changing one box clears its own message and the count in "Please
correct {N} errors." drops by one, and "Save" comes back with the last one.
<sup>b</sup>

| Field (UI label) | Required? | Rules |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| "Given Name" | yes | One box per form language (Rule 13) <sup>b</sup> |
| "Family Name" | no | One box per form language (Rule 13) <sup>b</sup> |
| "Email" | yes | Must be an email address ("This is not a valid email address."). Two suggestions on the same submission cannot share an address: the second is refused with "The email has already been taken." under the box, and so is an "Edit" that changes an entry to another entry's address; but the same address typed in another case is accepted as a second entry ⚠ [A6](#a6) <sup>b</sup> <sup>t3</sup> |
| "ORCID iD" | no | Shown after "Email" only while the journal's ORCID functionality is enabled (*ORCID integration*). Only an iD written in full, as "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097", saves; a bare "0000-0002-1825-0097" or anything else is refused with "The ORCID iD you specified is invalid. Please include the full URI (e.g. "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097")." Once saved, the iD shows again only in the author's "Edit" window ⚠ [A2](#a2) <sup>b</sup> <sup>t16</sup> |
| "Affiliation" | yes | One box per form language (Rule 13) <sup>b</sup> |
| "Reasons for suggesting reviewer" | yes | Rich text; the help under the label reads "Please share why you are recommending this reviewer and mention is there are any potential conflict of interest." ⚠ [A11](#a11). One box per form language (Rule 13) <sup>b</sup> |

## Rules & state

<a id="step"></a>
1. **Where it starts.** With "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" on, the
   submission wizard carries a step "Reviewer Suggestions" between "For the
   Editors" and "Review". Above the panel the step shows the
   journal's guidance text, which arrives as "When submitting, you have the
   option to suggest several potential reviewers. …" and is edited under
   Settings › Workflow › Submission, "Author Guidance", box "For Reviewer
   Suggestion"; the default text misspells "valuable" as "valueable"
   ⚠ [A7](#a7). <sup>c</sup> <sup>t15</sup>
2. **The step's panel.** The panel is headed "Reviewer Suggestions" with an
   "Add Reviewer Suggestion" button. Each entry shows the person's full
   name, their affiliation as a badge, and the email address on the line
   below, with "Edit" and "Delete" on the right. With no entry the panel
   reads "No items found.". <sup>c</sup> <sup>t4</sup>
3. **Adding.** "Add Reviewer Suggestion" opens the side window of that
   name (Fields). "Save" adds the entry to the panel and closes the window.
   A suggestion is stored the moment "Save" is pressed, not when the author
   presses "Continue": it survives "Save for Later" and is listed again
   when the draft is reopened. <sup>c</sup> <sup>t5</sup>
4. **Editing.** "Edit" opens the same window, titled "Edit", with the
   entry's values filled in; "Save" replaces the entry in place. Closing
   the window without "Save" drops what was typed, with no warning.
   <sup>d</sup>
5. **Deleting.** "Delete" asks "Are you sure you want to remove this
   suggestion? This action can not be undone." in a dialog titled "Delete
   Reviewer Suggestion", with the buttons "Delete Reviewer Suggestion" and
   "Cancel". Confirming removes the entry at once. <sup>d</sup>
6. **The Review step.** The wizard's Review step lists the suggestions
   under a heading "Reviewer Suggestions" with an "Edit" button that
   returns to the step: each entry shows the full name, the email address
   and the affiliation, not the reason. With no suggestion the block shows
   the warning "No reviewers have been suggested for this submission."
   instead. Suggestions are optional: the warning never blocks "Submit".
   <sup>e</sup> <sup>t17</sup>
7. **After submitting.** The author's own view of the workflow screen shows
   no suggestions panel on any stage, so once the submission is in, the
   author can neither see nor change what they suggested ⚠ [A4](#a4). The
   entries are kept for the editors. <sup>e</sup>
<a id="panel"></a>
8. **The editors' panel.** On the editorial view of the workflow screen a
   panel headed "Reviewers Suggested by Author" sits under the Participants
   panel, on the Submission stage and on the Review stage. It appears only
   while "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" is on and there is at least one
   suggestion to list. Each row shows the person's initials, full name, affiliation and
   the author's reason. On a press the panel belongs to the External Review
   stage; the Internal Review stage shows none ⚠ [OMP1](#omp1). <sup>f</sup>
   - 8a. On the Submission stage the panel lists every suggestion, the ones
     already turned into reviewers included, and offers no action on any
     row. <sup>f</sup> <sup>t6</sup>
   - 8b. On the Review stage the panel lists only pending suggestions. While
     the Review stage is the submission's current stage, each row ends in a
     "…" menu (labelled "{name} More Actions") holding one action, "Add
     Reviewer". Once the submission has moved on to Copyediting, the rows
     show without the menu. <sup>f</sup>
   - 8c. When the last pending suggestion is turned into a reviewer, the
     panel disappears from the Review stage. <sup>f</sup>
   - 8d. Switching "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" off hides the panel
     on every stage; the suggestions are kept, and the panel returns with
     them when the setting is switched on again. <sup>f</sup> <sup>t7</sup>
<a id="add-from-panel"></a>
9. **"Add Reviewer" from a suggestion.** The row's "Add Reviewer" opens the
   Add Reviewer window in one of three modes, chosen by the suggested email
   address: <sup>g</sup>
   - *The address belongs to an account holding a Reviewer role in this
     journal*: the window opens on "Selected Reviewer" showing that
     person's name and email, skipping "Locate a Reviewer", with the
     "Review Request" message and both due dates already filled; the editor
     changes what they want and presses "Add Reviewer". <sup>t8</sup>
   - *The address belongs to an account without a Reviewer role*: the window
     opens on the form "Enroll an Existing User as Reviewer" with that user
     already in "Search By Name" ("{name} ({email})") and "Enroll the user
     with this reviewer user group" set to the journal's reviewer role
     ("Reviewer"; on a press "External Reviewer"); the editor presses "Add
     Reviewer".
   - *No account carries the address*: the window opens on the form "Create
     New Reviewer" with "Given Name", "Family Name", "Email" and
     "Affiliation" filled from the suggestion; the editor types a
     "Username" (or presses "Suggest") and presses "Add Reviewer". With
     "Username" left empty, "Add Reviewer" is refused with "This field is
     required." under the box and the suggestion stays pending.
   In all three, a successful "Add Reviewer" adds the person to the
   Reviewers panel and the suggestion leaves the "Reviewers Suggested by
   Author" panel at once, with no reload (Rule 11). Closing the window
   before "Add Reviewer" (its "Cancel", or its "Close" arrow, which asks
   nothing even after typing) leaves the suggestion in the
   panel. The "Create New Reviewer" and "Enroll an Existing User as
   Reviewer" forms carry a "Back to Search" link that turns the window into
   the Reviewers panel's own Add Reviewer window (Rule 10); "Selected
   Reviewer" has no such link.
<a id="add-window"></a>
10. **The suggestions list inside Add Reviewer.** When the Reviewers
    panel's own "Add Reviewer" is pressed while the setting is on and the
    submission has pending suggestions, the window opens with a list "Select
    a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" above "Locate a Reviewer". Each
    entry shows the full name, affiliation and reason, and a "Select
    Reviewer" button (named "Select undefined" to screen readers
    ⚠ [A8](#a8)). An entry whose person is already a reviewer on this round
    while the suggestion is still pending (Rule 11 says how) shows the
    notice "This reviewer has already been assigned to this review round."
    and no button. <sup>h</sup> <sup>t13</sup>
    - "Select Reviewer" on a person holding a Reviewer role selects them in
      this same window, exactly as "Select Reviewer" in "Locate a Reviewer"
      does. <sup>h</sup>
    - "Select Reviewer" on anyone else opens a second "Add Reviewer" window
      on top, on the "Enroll an Existing User as Reviewer" or the "Create
      New Reviewer" form, prefilled as in Rule 9. When that inner "Add
      Reviewer" succeeds, the inner window closes, the entry leaves the
      suggestions list (its emptied row stays as a gap until the window is
      reopened ⚠ [A9](#a9)), the new reviewer appears in "Locate a
      Reviewer" marked as already assigned, and the outer window stays open
      until the editor presses the "Close" arrow at its top, its only close
      control. Closing either window discards what was typed without
      asking. The inner form's "Back to Search" opens a whole further Add
      Reviewer window inside the inner one instead of returning to the
      outer list ⚠ [A10](#a10). <sup>h</sup> <sup>t9</sup>
    - On a press the list appears in the Add Reviewer window of the
      Internal Review stage as well, although that stage shows no panel
      (Rule 8). <sup>h</sup> <sup>t10</sup>
<a id="approval"></a>
11. **What turns a suggestion into a reviewer.** The Add Reviewer window's
    "Add Reviewer" retires a suggestion the moment it puts a reviewer whose
    account email equals the suggested address on any round of the
    submission, from whichever route the editor took (Rule 9, Rule 10, or
    "Locate a Reviewer" picking the same person). A reviewer created from a
    suggestion under a different email address, changed in the "Create New
    Reviewer" form before "Add Reviewer", does not match: the suggestion
    stays pending. A reviewer who came onto a round without that window
    (scenario 3's given seeds one) leaves the suggestion pending too, and
    its entry shows Rule 10's notice. <sup>i</sup> <sup>t11</sup>
12. **Once matched, always matched.** A suggestion that has been turned
    into a reviewer never returns to the Review stage's panel or to the Add
    Reviewer list, even when that reviewer is later unassigned or
    cancelled; it stays listed on the Submission stage (Rule 8a)
    ⚠ [A3](#a3). <sup>i</sup> <sup>t12</sup>
13. **Languages.** Name, affiliation and reason are entered per form
    language. The window opens with one box each; on a journal with more
    than one form language, a button named for each other language (for
    example "French") adds that language's boxes. "Email" and "ORCID iD"
    have one box. The seeded and scratch journals have one form language.
    <sup>b</sup>

## Side effects

- Adding, editing or deleting a suggestion sends no email, raises no
  notification and writes nothing to the activity log. <sup>k</sup>
- Turning a suggestion into a reviewer records, where no screen shows it,
  which reviewer and which editor it became; the request email, the new
  reviewer's welcome email and the log rows of that "Add Reviewer" are the
  Add Reviewer window's own (*Reviewer assignment & management*).

| The inner window's "Back to Search" (a further window nested) | | register A10 carries it; not a user path |
| The emptied entry's blank row after an inner "Add Reviewer" | | register A9 carries it; passed on the no-account path |

Settings

| Setting | Runs in | Why not |
|---------|---------|---------|
| "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" off (default: no step, no panel, no list) | inside scenario 1 (the control: no step) | no panel and no list with the setting off: out of tier, with the flip row below |

## Cross-feature interactions

- **Submission wizard** owns the step rail, the gate that adds the
  "Reviewer Suggestions" step, the Review step's chrome and "Submit"; this
  spec owns what the step and its Review block show. <sup>p</sup>
- **Review setup & review forms** owns the "Reviewer Suggestion at
  Submission" checkbox
  ([→ review setup](U29-review-setup-and-review-forms.md#access)); this
  spec states only its effects. <sup>p</sup>
- **Submission stage** and **Review stage & rounds** own the workflow
  screen's stage layout and name the panel's place under Participants
  ([→ Submission stage panels](U25-submission-stage.md#panels),
  [→ review rounds](U26-review-stage-and-rounds.md#rounds)); the panel's
  content and actions are Rule 8 here. <sup>p</sup>
- **Reviewer assignment & management** owns the Add Reviewer window, its
  "Locate a Reviewer", "Create New Reviewer" and "Enroll Existing User"
  modes, the request email and the Reviewers panel row that results; this
  spec owns the suggestions list inside the window (Rule 10) and the
  matching that retires a suggestion (Rule 11). <sup>p</sup>
- **ORCID integration** owns "Enable ORCID functionality", which adds the
  "ORCID iD" box to the suggestion window (Fields). <sup>b</sup>
- **Workflow screen & stage access** owns who reaches which stage; the
  Actors table starts from that gate. <sup>p</sup>
- **Submission intake configuration** owns the "Author Guidance" boxes,
  including "For Reviewer Suggestion" (Rule 1). <sup>p</sup>

## Canonical scenarios

Scenarios 1 to 5 run on scratch journals created with "Reviewer Suggestion
at Submission" on, with throwaway accounts and scratch submissions;
scenario 1's control and scenario 6 run on the seeded journal and preprint
server with ready accounts. Accounts, passwords and the tooling recipe are
in the footnote. <sup>s</sup>

1. **The author suggests reviewers on a draft**: Author, on their own
   draft: open the draft's wizard; the step "Reviewer Suggestions" sits
   between "For the Editors" and "Review". On it, the guidance text above
   the panel begins "When submitting, you have the option to suggest
   several potential reviewers." (the default text misspells "valuable"
   [A7](#a7)), and the panel, headed "Reviewer Suggestions" with an "Add
   Reviewer Suggestion" button, reads "No items found.". Press "Continue":
   the "Review" step shows, under the heading "Reviewer Suggestions", the
   warning "No reviewers have been suggested for this submission."; press
   that block's "Edit" to return to the step. Press "Add Reviewer
   Suggestion" and then "Save" with every box empty: "This field is
   required." shows under "Given Name", "Email", "Affiliation" and "Reasons
   for suggesting reviewer", the top of the window reads "Please correct 4
   errors." with "Jump to next error", and "Save" cannot be pressed. Type
   Kay in "Given Name": its message clears, the top reads "Please correct 3
   errors." and "Save" still cannot be pressed. Type Suggested in "Family
   Name", kay.suggested@mail.test in "Email" and Public Knowledge University
   in "Affiliation": "Save" still cannot be pressed. Type "Expert in open
   access publishing; no conflict of interest." in "Reasons for suggesting
   reviewer": "Save" can be pressed again. Press "Save": the window closes
   and the panel lists "Kay Suggested" with the
   badge "Public Knowledge University", the address on the line below, and
   "Edit" and "Delete" on the right. Add a second entry the same way (Lee
   in "Given Name", Second in "Family Name", lee.second@mail.test in
   "Email", Second University in "Affiliation", "Knows the corpus." in
   "Reasons for suggesting reviewer"), then start a third with
   kay.suggested@mail.test in "Email" and the other required boxes filled
   as for Lee: "Save" is refused with "The email has already been taken."
   under "Email" and the panel keeps two entries (the same address typed
   in capitals would be accepted as a third [A6](#a6)); close the window.
   Press "Edit" on Kay's entry: the window is titled "Edit" with her values
   filled in; change "Affiliation" to Open University and press "Save": the
   entry's badge reads "Open University". Press "Delete" on Lee's entry: a
   dialog titled "Delete Reviewer Suggestion" asks "Are you sure you want
   to remove this suggestion? This action can not be undone."; press
   "Cancel": the entry stays; press "Delete" again and then "Delete
   Reviewer Suggestion": the entry is gone. Press "Save for Later" and
   reopen the draft from My Submissions: the step lists "Kay Suggested"
   again. Press "Continue": the "Review" step's "Reviewer Suggestions"
   block, with its "Edit" button, shows the full name, the email address
   and the affiliation, and no reason. Press "Submit" and confirm in the
   dialog that follows: the submission is in. Open it from My Submissions:
   no stage of the author's view shows a suggestions panel [A4](#a4).
   Journal Manager, on the same submission's Submission stage: under the
   Participants panel, "Reviewers Suggested by Author" lists Kay's initials,
   "Kay Suggested", "Open University" and the reason, with no action on the
   row. Control: on the seeded journal, where "Reviewer Suggestion at
   Submission" is off, a new draft's wizard has no "Reviewer Suggestions"
   step. <sup>s1</sup>

2. **The editor turns suggestions into reviewers from the panel**: Journal
   Manager, on a submission in review round 1 whose three suggestions are
   Kay Suggested (her address belongs to an account holding the Reviewer
   role), Lee Second (an account without a Reviewer role) and Nova Newcomer
   (no account carries the address): open the Submission stage: under the
   Participants panel, "Reviewers Suggested by Author" lists all three with
   initials, full name, affiliation and reason, and no action on any row.
   Open the Review stage: the same panel lists the three, and each row ends
   in a "…" menu labelled "{name} More Actions" holding one action, "Add
   Reviewer". Press "Add Reviewer" on Kay's row: the Add Reviewer window
   opens on "Selected Reviewer" showing her name and email, with no "Locate
   a Reviewer", the "Review Request" message and both due dates already
   filled; press "Cancel": the window closes without asking and Kay stays
   in the panel. Open it again and press "Add Reviewer": the Reviewers
   panel lists Kay, and her row leaves "Reviewers Suggested by Author" at
   once, with no reload. Press "Add Reviewer" on Lee's row: the window
   opens on "Enroll an Existing User as Reviewer" with "Search By Name"
   holding "Lee Second (lee.second@mail.test)" and "Enroll the user with
   this reviewer user group" set to "Reviewer" (on a press "External
   Reviewer"); press "Add Reviewer": the Reviewers panel lists Lee and his
   row is gone from the panel. Press "Add Reviewer" on Nova's row: the
   window opens on "Create New Reviewer" with "Given Name", "Family Name",
   "Email" and "Affiliation" filled from the suggestion; press "Add
   Reviewer" with "Username" empty: "This field is required." shows under
   the box and Nova stays in the panel. Type nova in "Username" and press
   "Add Reviewer": the Reviewers panel lists Nova, and "Reviewers Suggested
   by Author" disappears from the Review stage. Kay's mailbox holds the
   review request and Nova's the new reviewer's welcome email and the
   request. Open the Submission stage
   again: "Reviewers Suggested by Author" still lists all three, with no
   action on any row. Control: a submission of the same journal with no
   suggestion shows the panel on neither stage. <sup>s2</sup>

3. **The suggestions list inside Add Reviewer**: Journal Manager, on a
   submission in review round 1 whose three suggestions are Kay Suggested
   (on the round from the start, not through "Add Reviewer", so her
   suggestion is still pending: Rule 11), Pat Peer (an account holding the
   Reviewer role, not on the round) and Nova Newcomer (no account): press
   the Reviewers panel's own "Add Reviewer": the window opens with a list
   "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" above "Locate a Reviewer".
   Pat's and Nova's entries show the full name, affiliation and reason with
   a "Select Reviewer" button (named "Select undefined" to screen readers
   [A8](#a8)); Kay's shows the notice "This reviewer has already been
   assigned to this review round." and no button. Press "Select Reviewer"
   on Pat's entry: this same window changes to "Selected Reviewer" with
   his name and email; press "Add Reviewer": the Reviewers panel lists Pat. Press
   the Reviewers panel's "Add Reviewer" again: the list no longer has
   Pat's entry. Press "Select Reviewer" on Nova's entry: a
   second "Add Reviewer" window opens on top, on "Create New Reviewer" with
   "Given Name", "Family Name", "Email" and "Affiliation" filled from the
   suggestion; type nova in "Username" and press "Add Reviewer": the inner
   window closes, Nova's entry leaves the list (its emptied row stays as a
   gap [A9](#a9)), Nova appears in "Locate a Reviewer" marked as already
   assigned, and the outer window stays open. Press the "Close" arrow at
   its top: the Reviewers panel lists Kay, Pat and Nova, and the Review
   stage's "Reviewers Suggested by Author" lists Kay alone, with her "…"
   menu. Control: on a submission of the same journal with no suggestion, "Add
   Reviewer" opens with no "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions"
   list. <sup>s3</sup>

4. **The Funding Coordinator meets the error dialog**: Funding Coordinator
   assigned to a submission in review round 1 whose two suggestions are Kay
   Suggested (an account holding the Reviewer role) and Nova Newcomer (no
   account): open the Review stage: no "Reviewers Suggested by Author"
   panel shows; instead a dialog titled "Error" opens, reading "The current
   role does not have access to this operation.", with one button, "OK"
   [A1](#a1); press "OK". Open the Submission stage: the same dialog; press
   "OK". Back on the Review stage, press the Reviewers panel's "Add
   Reviewer": the window opens with "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer
   Suggestions" listing both, each with "Select Reviewer". Press "Select
   Reviewer" on Kay's entry: this same window changes to "Selected
   Reviewer" with her name and email; press "Add Reviewer": the Reviewers
   panel lists Kay. Press the Reviewers panel's "Add Reviewer" again and
   "Select Reviewer" on Nova's entry: a second window opens on "Create New
   Reviewer", filled in; type nova in "Username" and press its "Add
   Reviewer": the form stays open, no message shows and the Reviewers
   panel does not gain Nova [A5](#a5); press the "Close" arrow of each
   window. Control: Journal Manager, on the same submission's Review
   stage: no dialog opens, and "Reviewers Suggested by Author" lists Nova
   and not Kay. <sup>s4</sup>

5. **Internal Review offers the list without the panel** {OMP}: Press
   Editor, on a monograph in Internal Review round 1 whose two suggestions
   are Nova Newcomer (no account) and Kay Suggested: open the Internal
   Review stage: no "Reviewers Suggested by Author" panel shows
   [OMP1](#omp1). Press the Reviewers panel's "Add Reviewer": the window
   opens with "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" above "Locate a
   Reviewer", listing both. Press "Select Reviewer" on Nova's entry: a
   second "Add Reviewer" window opens on "Create New Reviewer", filled from
   the suggestion; type nova in "Username" and press "Add Reviewer": the
   inner window closes and Nova's entry leaves the list; press the "Close"
   arrow: the internal round's Reviewers panel lists Nova. Record the
   decision "Send to External Review" and open the External Review stage:
   "Reviewers Suggested
   by Author" lists Kay only, her row ending in the "…" menu with "Add
   Reviewer"; the Reviewers panel's "Add Reviewer" window has Kay's entry
   alone under "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions"; the round's
   Reviewers panel starts empty. Control: the Submission stage's "Reviewers
   Suggested by Author" lists both, with no action, so the missing panel is
   Internal Review's alone. <sup>s5</sup>

6. **No suggestions on a preprint server** {OPS}: Author, on the seeded
   preprint server: start a new submission; the wizard has no "Reviewer
   Suggestions" step. Preprint Server Manager: Settings › Workflow has no
   "Review" tab, so "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" cannot be switched
   on; the workflow screen of a posted preprint shows no "Reviewers
   Suggested by Author" panel. Control: on a journal with the setting on,
   the same wizard carries the step (scenario 1) and the same screen the
   panel (scenario 2). <sup>s6</sup>

**A1 — The Funding Coordinator gets an error dialog instead of the panel** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A Funding Coordinator assigned to a submission opens its Submission or
Review stage on a journal with "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" on and
expects the stage as usual, with or without the "Reviewers Suggested by
Author" panel. Instead a dialog titled "Error" opens, reading "The current
role does not have access to this operation.", with one button, "OK"; no
panel shows, and the dialog opens even when the submission carries no
suggestion. On a journal with the setting off no dialog opens. The rest of
the stage is usable once the dialog is dismissed.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a1</sup>

<a id="a2"></a>
**A2 — An ORCID iD typed on a suggestion is seen again only in the author's "Edit" window** · ❓ · minor.
With ORCID enabled the suggestion window offers an "ORCID iD" box and
checks its shape, but the saved iD shows again only in the author's own
"Edit" window before submitting: not in the wizard's panel, the Review
step, the editors' panel or the Add Reviewer list, and the "Create New
Reviewer" form opened from the suggestion has no ORCID box, so the new
account never gets it.
Question: should the iD reach the editors and the created reviewer, or
should the box go? Lean: carry it into the panel row and the new reviewer's
profile; collecting a value no editor sees is the worse outcome.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a2</sup>

<a id="a3"></a>
**A3 — A matched suggestion is offered nowhere again** · ❓ · minor.
An editor turns a suggestion into a reviewer and later unassigns or cancels
that reviewer. The suggestion does not come back to the Review stage's
"Reviewers Suggested by Author" panel or to the Add Reviewer list; it is
still listed on the Submission stage (Rule 8a) but offered nowhere.
Question: should unassigning restore the suggestion? Lean: intended; the
suggestion served its purpose and the reviewer stays findable in "Locate a
Reviewer".
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a3</sup>

<a id="a4"></a>
**A4 — The author loses sight of their suggestions on submitting** · ❓ · minor.
After the final "Submit", the author's view of the workflow screen has no
suggestions panel on any stage, so the author cannot re-read what they
suggested, let alone correct a typo in an email address.
Question: should the author's view list the suggestions read-only? Lean:
list them read-only on the Submission stage; the author's own input is
otherwise invisible to them.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a4</sup>

<a id="a5"></a>
**A5 — The Funding Coordinator's "Create New Reviewer" from a suggestion does nothing** · 🐞 · user-visible.
A Funding Coordinator presses "Select Reviewer" on a suggestion whose
person has no account and gets the "Create New Reviewer" form, filled in.
Pressing its "Add Reviewer" changes nothing: the form stays open, no
message shows and the Reviewers panel still reads "No Items". The same
role's "Select Reviewer" on a person holding a Reviewer role works. The
Add Reviewer window never shows this role its own "Create New Reviewer"
and "Enroll Existing User" links (*Reviewer assignment & management*); the
suggestions list offers a form the role cannot complete, and says nothing.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a5</sup>

<a id="a6"></a>
**A6 — The same address in another case is accepted as a second suggestion** · 🐞 · minor.
An author adds a suggestion and then another with the same address typed
in capitals. The author expects the refusal "The email has already been
taken." and instead gets a second entry: the two addresses differ only in
case, and the check compares them letter for letter.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a6</sup>

<a id="a7"></a>
**A7 — The default "For Reviewer Suggestion" text misspells "valuable"** · 🐞 · minor.
The guidance every author reads above the step's panel, until a manager
edits the box, says "provide valueable input for the editorial team".
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a7</sup>

<a id="a8"></a>
**A8 — A suggestion's "Select Reviewer" is named "Select undefined" to screen readers** · 🐞 · minor.
In "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" every "Select Reviewer"
button carries the hidden name "Select undefined", where the same button
in "Locate a Reviewer" reads "Select {name}". A screen-reader user cannot
tell the entries' buttons apart; sighted use is unaffected.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a8</sup>

<a id="a9"></a>
**A9 — An entry turned into a reviewer leaves a blank row in the Add Reviewer list** · 🐞 · minor.
After an inner "Add Reviewer" succeeds, the entry's text leaves "Select a
Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" but its row stays as a gap until the
window is closed and opened again.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a9</sup>

<a id="a10"></a>
**A10 — "Back to Search" in the inner window nests a further Add Reviewer window** · 🐞 · minor.
An editor in a suggestion's inner "Add Reviewer" window presses "Back to
Search" expecting the outer list. Instead a whole further Add Reviewer
window, suggestions list included, opens inside the inner one, and a third
can stack from it. Nothing is lost; the way back is the windows' close
controls.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a10</sup>

<a id="a11"></a>
**A11 — The help under "Reasons for suggesting reviewer" reads "mention is there are any"** · 🐞 · minor.
The help text every author reads under the reason box in the "Add
Reviewer Suggestion" window says "Please share why you are recommending
this reviewer and mention is there are any potential conflict of
interest." ("is there" for "if there"; a sibling of A7).
Basis: probe. <sup>f-a11</sup>

### OMP

<a id="omp1"></a>
**OMP1 — Internal Review shows no panel, yet its Add Reviewer window offers the suggestions** · ❓ · minor.
On a press the "Reviewers Suggested by Author" panel appears on the
Submission and External Review stages only. The Internal Review stage
shows no panel, but its Add Reviewer window still opens with "Select a
Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" above "Locate a Reviewer", and a
suggestion turned into an internal reviewer there is gone from the External
Review panel and list later on, while that round's Reviewers table starts
empty.
Question: do the author's suggestions apply to internal review? Lean: the
panel's absence is the intent (suggestions target external review) and the
list inside Internal Review's Add Reviewer is the leak.
Basis: probe. <sup>f-omp1</sup>

<a id="footnotes"></a>
## Footnotes — mechanism & evidence

<a id="fn-a"></a>
**a** — Roles. The service behind every screen here is `PKP\API\v1\reviewers\suggestions\ReviewerSuggestionController` (`submissions/{submissionId}/reviewers/suggestions`: `GET`, `GET {suggestionId}`, `POST`, `PUT {suggestionId}`, `DELETE {suggestionId}`); `getRouteGroupMiddleware()` gates the whole group on `ROLE_ID_SITE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_ID_MANAGER`, `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, `ROLE_ID_AUTHOR` (no `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT`, hence A1), and `authorize()` adds `SubmissionAccessPolicy` plus, for `add`/`edit`/`delete`, `SubmissionIncompletePolicy` with the message `user.authorization.submission.complete.reviewerSuggestionRestrict` ("Add, update or delete of reviewer suggestion for completed submission is restricted."), so writes work only on a draft. The wizard is `PKP\pages\submission\PKPSubmissionHandler` (roles Author, Section Editor, Manager, Site Admin). The editors' panel is pushed by `workflowConfigEditorialOJS.js` only (`getSecondaryItems` of `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_SUBMISSION` and `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EXTERNAL_REVIEW`, guarded by `pageInitConfig.publicationSettings.isReviewerSuggestionEnabled`, which `PKPDashboardHandler` sets from the context's `reviewerSuggestionEnabled`); `workflowConfigAuthorOJS.js` and `workflowConfigAuthorOMP.js` never push `ReviewerSuggestionManager`, so the author view has none. The row action opens `ReviewerGridHandler::showReviewerForm`, whose `PKPReviewerGridHandler::__construct()` grants review-round operations to Manager, Site Admin and Sub-editor, and to Assistant minus `createReviewer`, `enrollReviewer` and `gossip`. OPS: `ops/schemas/context.json` has no `reviewerSuggestionEnabled`, `ops/schemas/submission.json` no `reviewerSuggestions`, `ops/api/v1/submissions/index.php` does not mount the controller (OJS and OMP do), and `PKPReviewSetupForm::addReviewSuggestionControl()` adds the checkbox only when the context schema carries the property. Read 2026-09-06; the OJS and OMP copies of every file named in this tail are byte-identical. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Purpose; the OPS absence; Actors terms and rows 1–4), OJS and OMP scratch journals with the setting switched on through Settings › Workflow › Review, OPS scratch server and `publicknowledge` read-only on all three: the seeded `admin`, holding no role on the scratch journal, saw the panel on both stages and the row's "Add Reviewer" menu; OMP's `registry/userGroups.xml` defines no guest-editor group (OJS's does); the panel and menu showed for manager, editor, section editor and (OJS) guest editor, never for the author's view; the Funding Coordinator's dialog is note f-a1. Row 1: the manager opened a draft's wizard with the step by its address and from the Editor Dashboard ("All in submission stage", the row "Incomplete" › "Complete submission"; the dashboard's views are Assigned to me, Active submissions, Needs editor, All in submission stage, Needs reviews, All in review stage, All in copyediting stage, All in production stage, no "Incomplete" view); a section editor, another author, a reviewer and a reader typing the address landed on `user/authorizationDenied?message=user.authorization.roleBasedAccessDenied` (the unassigned sub-editor fails `SubmissionAccessPolicy` on a draft). OPS: no Review tab under Settings › Workflow on the scratch server or `publicknowledge`, `settings/workflow#review` changes nothing, the wizard's steps are Upload Files, Details, Contributors, For Readers, Review, and the manager's workflow screen of a posted preprint shows Production Tasks & Discussions and Participants only.

<a id="fn-p"></a>
**p** — Pointers and definitions. These sentences say where another spec's rules live, or define a term whose claims are Rules 2–5 and 11; they claim no screen of this spec's own and were declared, not driven, at the 2026-09-06 claim check. The screen facts they carry in passing were seen that day on the chunk snapshots: the panel sits under "PARTICIPANTS" on both stages; the setting's box reads "Allow authors to suggest potential reviewers at submission process"; the Add Reviewer window's "Locate a Reviewer", "Create New Reviewer" and "Enroll Existing User" modes exist as *Reviewer assignment & management* describes them.

<a id="fn-b"></a>
**b** — The window is `PKP\components\forms\submission\ReviewerSuggestionsForm` (id `reviewerSuggestions`, `POST`): `FieldText('givenName', isMultilingual, isRequired)`, `FieldText('familyName', isMultilingual)`, `FieldText('email', isRequired)`, `FieldText('affiliation', isMultilingual, isRequired)`, `FieldRichTextarea('suggestionReason', isMultilingual, isRequired, label reviewerSuggestion.suggestionReason, description reviewerSuggestion.suggestionReason.description)`, and `FieldText('orcidId', label user.orcid, tooltip orcid.about.orcidExplanation)` inserted `FIELD_POSITION_AFTER 'email'` when `OrcidManager::isEnabled()`. Server rules, `formRequests/AddReviewerSuggestion::rules()`: `givenName` required, `familyName` sometimes, `email` required + `email` + `Rule::unique('reviewer_suggestions')` scoped to the submission (`EditReviewerSuggestion` ignores the row being edited), `affiliation` required, `suggestionReason` required, `orcidId` nullable + `orcid`; `HasMultilingualRule` takes the context's `getSupportedFormLocales()` plus the site primary locale. Messages: `validator.required` "This field is required.", `validator.email` "This is not a valid email address."; the `orcid` rule's message as shown is "The ORCID iD you specified is invalid. Please include the full URI (e.g. "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097")." (not `validator.orcid`'s "This is not a valid ORCID."), and it refuses the bare 16-digit form as well. The submit button is `FormComponent`'s default `common.save` "Save". Upstream `cypress/tests/data/60-content/ZzeddSubmission.cy.js` presses "Save" empty and expects "This field is required." on `givenName`, `email`, `affiliation` and `suggestionReason`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Fields; Rule 13; the ORCID cross-feature line), OJS and OMP: the on-screen label is "Email" (`* Required`); the help under "Reasons for suggesting reviewer" reads, letter for letter, "Please share why you are recommending this reviewer and mention is there are any potential conflict of interest." (the "is there" is the screen's); "Save" on the empty window shows the four "This field is required." messages plus the summary "Please correct 4 errors. Go to Given Name: This field is required. … Jump to next error" and leaves "Save" disabled; test run 2026-09-06 (scenario 1), OJS and OMP: with "Given Name" alone filled, three "This field is required." and "Please correct 3 errors. Go to Email … Go to Affiliation … Go to Reasons for suggesting reviewer …" stayed up and "Save" stayed disabled (the first run's "Save" press resolved to the disabled button 24 times), still disabled after "Email" and "Affiliation", enabled only once the reason was typed (lib/ui-library `FormPage.vue` disables the button while any error remains on the form's page); `not-an-email` gets the email message; a second entry with the same address, and an edit to another entry's address, get "The email has already been taken." (`validator.unique`, the `Rule::unique` match is case-sensitive: the same address in capitals saved as a second entry, finding A6); `1234` and the bare `0000-0002-1825-0097` get the ORCID message, `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097` saves; the box carries the tooltip "ORCID is an independent non-profit organization … Learn more at https://orcid.org.". Languages: a scratch context has one form language until French is ticked under Settings › Website › Setup › Languages "Forms"; then the window opens with the single `-en` boxes and a "French" button that adds `givenName-fr_CA`, `familyName-fr_CA`, `affiliation-fr_CA` and a second reason editor (`…suggestionReason-control-fr_CA_ifr`), while `email` and `orcidId` stay single. ORCID: Settings › Users & Roles › ORCID, "Enable ORCID functionality" unticked removes the "ORCID iD" box, ticked restores it; a scratch context created with `orcid: {enabled: true}` arrives with it ticked.

<a id="fn-c"></a>
**c** — `PKPSubmissionHandler::getSteps()` inserts `getReviewerSuggestionsStep()` (id `reviewerSuggestions`, name and reviewName `submission.reviewerSuggestions` "Reviewer Suggestions", section description the context's `reviewerSuggestionsHelp`, review template `submission/review-reviewer-suggestions.tpl`) after the editors step when `reviewerSuggestionEnabled`; `getReviewerSuggestionsListPanel()` builds `PKP\components\listPanels\ReviewerSuggestionsListPanel` (id `reviewerSuggestions`, title "Reviewer Suggestions", `canEditPublication` true). `ReviewerSuggestionsListPanel.vue`: header button `grid.action.addReviewerSuggestion` "Add Reviewer Suggestion" and the per-item `common.edit` / `common.delete` are guarded by `publication.status !== STATUS_PUBLISHED && canEditPublication`, always true in the wizard; item title `localize(item.fullName)` + `Badge` `localize(item.affiliation)`, subtitle `item.email`; `formSuccess()` after a `POST` pushes the returned item into `submission.reviewerSuggestions` (`SubmissionWizardPage.vue::setReviewerSuggestion`), so the store is the API, not the wizard's autosave. `ListPanel.vue` falls back to `common.noItemsFound` "No items found." when no `emptyLabel` is given, and this panel gives none. `reviewerSuggestionsHelp` defaults to `default.submission.step.reviewerSuggestions` (migration `I4787_AddReviewSuggestionHelp`) and is edited in `SubmissionGuidanceSettings::addReviewSuggestionGuidanceDetail()` (`FieldRichTextarea('reviewerSuggestionsHelp')`, label `submission.forReviewerSuggestion` "For Reviewer Suggestion", description `manager.setup.workflow.reviewerSuggestionsHelp.description`), a form headed `manager.setup.workflow.guidance` "Author Guidance". Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 1–3), OJS and OMP: the rail reads Upload Files, Details, Contributors, For the Editors, "5 Reviewer Suggestions", "6 Review"; the default guidance in full is "When submitting, you have the option to suggest several potential reviewers. This can help streamline the review process and provide valueable input for the editorial team. Please choose reviewers who are expert in your field and have no conflict of interest with your work. This feature aims to enhance the review process and support a more efficient experience for both authors and editorial team." (the misspelling is in `default.submission.step.reviewerSuggestions`, finding A7); the panel is headed "Reviewer Suggestions" with "Add Reviewer Suggestion" and reads "No items found." when empty; an entry shows the full name, the affiliation as a badge, the address on the next line, "Edit" and "Delete"; each "Save" is its own `POST …/reviewers/suggestions` before any "Continue", and entries survive "Save for Later" and a reopen from My Submissions ("Complete submission" on the Incomplete row).

<a id="fn-d"></a>
**d** — `ReviewerSuggestionsListPanel.vue::openEditModal()` fetches `GET …/suggestions/{id}`, fills the form, sets `method: 'PUT'` and titles the side modal `grid.action.edit` "Edit"; `openDeleteModal()` opens `openDialog({title: grid.action.deleteReviewerSuggestion, message: grid.action.deleteReviewerSuggestion.confirmationMessage, actions: [{label: grid.action.deleteReviewerSuggestion, isWarnable}, {label: common.cancel}]})` and on confirm sends `POST` with `X-Http-Method-Override: DELETE`, then filters the item out of `submission.reviewerSuggestions`. Strings: "Delete Reviewer Suggestion", "Are you sure you want to remove this suggestion? This action can not be undone." (the message takes no name, although the call passes one), "Cancel". The upstream Cypress test cancels once and confirms once, expecting one then zero `li.listPanel__item`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 4–5), OJS and OMP: the "Edit" window opens prefilled, the reason included, and "Save" replaces the entry in place; the window's close control with an unsaved change closed it at once with no dialog and the entry unchanged; the delete dialog's "Cancel" keeps the entry and "Delete Reviewer Suggestion" removes it down to "No items found.".

<a id="fn-e"></a>
**e** — `lib/pkp/templates/submission/review-reviewer-suggestions.tpl`: `h3` `{$step.reviewName}`, an "Edit" `pkp-button` calling `openStep('reviewerSuggestions')`, then either a `notification type="warning"` with `submission.wizard.noReviewerSuggestions` when `!submission.reviewerSuggestions?.length`, or one `li` per suggestion with `localize(fullName)`, `email`, `localize(affiliation)`. No submit-time validation names `reviewerSuggestions` (`api/v1/submissions` has no reference), so the empty warning is advisory. After submit the author has no reading surface (note a) and the API refuses writes (`SubmissionIncompletePolicy`). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 6–7), OJS and OMP: the Review step's block is headed "Reviewer Suggestions" with "Edit" (which lands on "5 Reviewer Suggestions"), each entry the full name, then the address, then the affiliation, no reason; with none, the warning "No reviewers have been suggested for this submission." and "Submit" then the dialog's "Submit" complete the submission ("Submission complete"). Rule 7: the author's workflow view of submissions with no, one and a seeded suggestion showed no panel or text on Submission, Review (OMP: Internal and External Review), Copyediting or Production, while the manager's view of the same submissions showed "Reviewers Suggested by Author".

<a id="fn-f"></a>
**f** — `ReviewerSuggestionManager.vue`: root `v-if="reviewerSuggestionManagerStore.reviewerSuggestionsList.length > 0"`, heading `editor.submission.reviewerSuggestions` "Reviewers Suggested by Author", one `li` per item with `UserAvatar` (`displayInitials`), `fullName`, `affiliation`, `suggestionReason` (`v-strip-unsafe-html`), and a `DropdownActions` (`button-variant="ellipsis"`, label `` `${fullName} ${common.moreActions}` ``) rendered `v-if="atActiveReviewStage()"`. `reviewerSuggestionManagerStore.js`: `relativeUrl` is `…/reviewers/suggestions?approved=false` when `props.reviewRoundId` is set (the Review stage) and `…/reviewers/suggestions` otherwise (the Submission stage, whose config passes `selectedReviewRound?.id`, undefined there); `reviewerSuggestionsList` further drops items with `reviewerId` only when `reviewRoundId` is set; `atActiveReviewStage()` = `reviewRoundId && submissionStageId === WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_EXTERNAL_REVIEW && submissionStageId === submission.stageId`. `getMany()` honours `?approved=` through `scopeWithApproved`. OMP: `useWorkflowConfigOMP.js` deep-merges `workflowConfigEditorialOJS` with `workflowConfigEditorialOMP`, which overrides only `getActionItems` of the Submission stage and defines `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_INTERNAL_REVIEW` with its own `getSecondaryItems` (no `ReviewerSuggestionManager`), so the panel inherits on Submission and External Review and is absent on Internal Review; `atActiveReviewStage()` is false on stage 2 regardless. Setting off: `isReviewerSuggestionEnabled` false → the item is never pushed; the rows stay in `reviewer_suggestions`. Upstream Cypress ("Submission has reviewer suggestion section visible") expects the heading with no "More Actions" button on the Submission stage, no heading after `disableReviewerSuggestion()`, and one "More Actions" per suggestion once the submission is in review. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 8, 8a–8d, both ends), OJS and OMP, as manager, section editor and site admin: the panel under "PARTICIPANTS" on the Submission stage and Review round 1; none on a submission with no suggestion, none once the last pending one was matched, none on Copyediting; rows read initials, full name, affiliation, reason; the Submission stage kept all four rows with no button after three were matched and after Copyediting, the Review stage went 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 with a "{name} More Actions" button holding one item, "Add Reviewer", and after "Accept Submission" listed the pending row without the menu; untick and "Save" removed the panel from every stage, tick and "Save" brought it back with the same names. OMP: no panel on Internal Review, the panel on the External Review round.

<a id="fn-g"></a>
**g** — `useReviewerSuggestionManagerActions.js::reviewerSuggestionApprove()` opens the legacy modal `grid.users.reviewer.ReviewerGridHandler` op `showReviewerForm` titled `editor.submission.addReviewer` "Add Reviewer" with `reviewerSuggestionId` and `selectionType` = `REVIEWER_SELECT_ADVANCED_SEARCH` when `existingUserId && hasExistingReviewerRole`, `REVIEWER_SELECT_ENROLL_EXISTING` when `existingUserId` only, else `REVIEWER_SELECT_CREATE`. `PKPReviewerGridHandler::_getReviewerForm()` loads the `ReviewerSuggestion`, throws on an unknown id and on `isApproved()`, and hands it to the form. Prefill: `AdvancedSearchReviewerForm::initData()` sets `reviewerId` to the existing user and `fetch()` assigns `reviewerName` / `reviewerEmail`, so `advancedSearchReviewerForm.tpl` skips its `{if !isset($reviewerId)}` block ("Locate a Reviewer") and shows `editor.submission.selectedReviewer` "Selected Reviewer"; `EnrollExistingReviewerForm::initData()` sets `userId` and `selectedUser` = `fullName (email)`; `CreateReviewerForm::initData()` sets `familyName`, `givenName`, `email`, `affiliation` (not `orcidId`). Each template carries `reviewerSuggestionId` as a hidden field. The model's `existingUser` is `Repo::user()->getByEmail($this->email)` and `hasExistingReviewerRole` is `existingUser->hasRole([ROLE_ID_REVIEWER], contextId)`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 9, all three modes), OJS and OMP: "Selected Reviewer / {name} — {email}" with no "Locate a Reviewer" and no suggestions list, the "Review Request" template already in the message box under "Choose a predefined message to use, or fill out the form below." and both due dates set four weeks out; "Enroll an Existing User as Reviewer" with "Search By Name*" holding "{name} ({email})", "Enroll the user with this reviewer user group*" set to its only option ("Reviewer" on OJS, "External Reviewer" on OMP), a ticked masthead box and "Back to Search" above; "Create New Reviewer" with "Given Name*", "Family Name", "Email*", "Affiliation" filled, "Username*" empty with "Suggest", "Reviewing Interests", "Masthead", the file under "Files To Be Reviewed" preselected; "Add Reviewer" with "Username" empty sent nothing and showed "This field is required." under the box; each successful "Add Reviewer" (`update-reviewer`, `enroll-reviewer`, `create-reviewer`, 200) put "{name} / Request Sent" in the Reviewers table and the browser re-fetched `…/reviewers/suggestions?approved=false`, the row gone with no reload; the header "Close" with text typed in the message, and the form's "Cancel", closed the window with no question and the row still listed; "Back to Search" on the Create and Enroll forms showed the full window with the suggestions list, "Selected Reviewer" offers no "Change" and no such link.

<a id="fn-h"></a>
**h** — `PKPSelectReviewerListPanel::getConfig()` adds `suggestionTitle` (`editor.submission.findAndSelectReviewerFromSuggestions` "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions"), `suggestions` (`ReviewerSuggestion::withSubmissionIds()->withApproved(false)`) and `reviewerSuggestionsApiUrl` whenever the context's `reviewerSuggestionEnabled` is set, on every stage the window opens for (OMP internal review included, hence OMP1). `SelectReviewerListPanel.vue` renders the suggestions `ListPanel` `v-if="suggestions.length > 0"` above the reviewer list, each item a `SelectReviewerSuggestionListItem` `v-if="!item.approvedAt"` with `currently-assigned` = `currentlyAssigned.includes(item.existingUserId)`. The item shows `fullName`, `affiliation`, `suggestionReason`, the notice `reviewer.list.currentlyAssigned` "This reviewer has already been assigned to this review round." when assigned, and a `PkpButton` `selectReviewerLabel` (`editor.submission.selectReviewer` "Select Reviewer") `v-if="canSelect"` (false when assigned). `select()`: with `existingUserId && hasExistingReviewerRole` it emits `pkp.eventBus 'selected:reviewer'` with the user's id, name and email (the same event the reviewer list's own button emits); otherwise `useLegacyGridUrl().openLegacyModal()` opens a second `showReviewerForm` modal titled "Add Reviewer" with `selectionType` chosen as in note g and `reviewerSuggestionId`; its close callback calls `updateReviewerSuggestionList(id)`, which re-reads the suggestion with `include_reviewer_data` and, when `approvedAt` is set, marks it approved (the item's `v-if` hides it) and pushes `r.reviewer` into the reviewer list and `currentlyAssigned`. Upstream Cypress ("Add non exist suggested reviewer from Add Reviewer list") presses "Select Reviewer", fills the username in the last "Add Reviewer" dialog, presses its "Add Reviewer", then presses "Close" on the remaining dialog. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 10, both ends, manager, section editor and site admin), OJS and OMP: the window's headings in order "Add Reviewer", "Submission Author List", "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions", "Locate a Reviewer"; no list on a submission without suggestions and none with the setting off; the seed-invited reviewer's entry showed "This reviewer has already been assigned to this review round." and no button; "Select Reviewer" on a person with the Reviewer role rewrote the same window to "Selected Reviewer / {name} — {email} / Change", identical to the reviewer list's own button; on anyone else a second "Add Reviewer" dialog stacked (three dialogs counted) on the Create or Enroll form; after its "Add Reviewer" the inner dialog closed, a notice "{name} was assigned to review this submission and sent an email notification." showed, the entry's text left the list while its `li` stayed empty (finding A9), the new reviewer sat under "Locate a Reviewer" with the assigned notice and no button, and the outer window's only close control was one `button.DialogClose`, the "<" arrow named "Close"; the inner "Cancel" (`a.cancelButton`) with a username typed closed it with no question; "Back to Search" in the inner window rendered a full Add Reviewer inside it (author list, suggestions list, "Locate a Reviewer", an empty "Selected Reviewer … Change" block), a fourth dialog stacked from it, and the console logged `The handler "$.pkp.controllers.grid.users.reviewer.AdvancedReviewerSearchHandler" has already been bound to the selected element!` and the same for `AddReviewerFormHandler` (finding A10); the suggestion entries' "Select Reviewer" had the accessible name "Select undefined" against "Select {name}" in the reviewer list (finding A8). OMP: the Internal Review window carried the list; a no-account suggestion added there went onto the internal round and later off the External Review panel and list.

<a id="fn-i"></a>
**i** — `ReviewerForm::execute()` (the parent of all three modes), after creating the assignment: `$this->reviewerSuggestion ??= ReviewerSuggestion::withSubmissionIds([submissionId])->withApproved(false)->withEmail($reviewer->getData('email'))->first()`, then `if ($this->reviewerSuggestion?->hasExistingReviewerRole && $this->reviewerSuggestion->existingUser->getId() == $reviewerId) approveAndAttachReviewer(now, $reviewerId, $currentUser->getId())`. For Create and Enroll the suggestion is the one passed by id, and its `existingUser`/`hasExistingReviewerRole` (cached attributes) are first read after the user was created and enrolled, so they match when the email is unchanged; a changed email leaves `existingUser` null. `ReviewerSuggestion::approvedAt()` and `reviewerId()` are `Attribute::set` closures returning `$this->fresh()?->approvedAt ?? $value`, so neither can be cleared once set; nothing in `PKPReviewerGridHandler::unassignReviewer()` / `cancelReviewer()` touches `reviewer_suggestions`. Table `reviewer_suggestions` (`ReviewerSuggestionsMigration`, columns `approved_at`, `approver_id`, `reviewer_id`; `I11673_AddMissingApprovalToReviewerSuggestion` for upgrades); the feature ships with 3.5.0 (`I4787_InstallReviewerSuggestion`, 2025). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 11–12), OJS and OMP: a reviewer picked through "Locate a Reviewer" with no use of the list retired his suggestion, as did the list's own path, the inner Enroll and the inner Create; a reviewer created from the row's window with "Email" changed to another address appeared in the Reviewers table while the suggestion stayed in the panel and the list; on a two-round submission a reviewer added from round 2's list left round 1's panel and list too. After "Unassign Reviewer" (before a response) and after "Cancel Reviewer" (after "Accept Review, Continue to Step #2"; the row reads "Request Cancelled") the suggestion was in neither the Review stage's panel nor the list, "Locate a Reviewer" offered the person again with "Select Reviewer", and the Submission stage's panel still listed the name.

<a id="fn-k"></a>
**k** — No mailable, `Notification` type or `SubmissionLog` event references `ReviewerSuggestion` (`grep -r ReviewerSuggestion lib/pkp/classes/mail lib/pkp/classes/notification lib/pkp/classes/log` is empty); the controller's `add`/`edit`/`delete` write the model and return it. `approveAndAttachReviewer()` writes `approved_at`, `approver_id`, `reviewer_id` only. The request email, `ReviewerRegister` welcome email and the grid's log rows are `ReviewerForm::execute()` / `CreateReviewerForm::execute()` as documented in *Reviewer assignment & management*. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (Side effects), OJS and OMP: add, edit and delete on a draft sent nothing to the suggested or the author's address (counted per recipient; the mail catcher sits at its 500-message cap); after the submit the Activity Log held "Article submitted" (OJS) / "Initial submission completed." (OMP) and the needs-an-editor email row only; after each "Add Reviewer" from the panel it gained "{name} has been assigned to review submission {id} for review round 1." and "An email has been sent: Invitation to review" (OJS) / "Manuscript Review Request" (OMP), no row naming a suggestion; the no-account address received "Registration as Reviewer with {journal}" and the request, the others the request only.

<a id="fn-s"></a>
**s** — Tooling. A scratch journal with the feature on: `POST scenarios/context` with `review: {reviewerSuggestionEnabled: true}` and `users[]` holding the throwaway `author`, `editor` (manager level) or `sectionEditor`, plus one `externalReviewer` for the "account with a Reviewer role" path and one `reader` for the "account without a Reviewer role" path (the seeded reviewers are not enrolled on a scratch context). The wizard scenario starts from `POST scenarios/submission` with `submitted: false` and opens `submission?id={id}` as the author. The editor-side scenarios need suggestions on a submitted submission: `POST scenarios/submission` takes `reviewerSuggestions[]` (`givenName` required, `familyName`, `email` required and unique within the list, `affiliation`, `suggestionReason`; the context must carry `review.reviewerSuggestionEnabled: true`; OPS refuses the key), built 2026-09-06 and byte-identical in the database to a suggestion typed on the step. An address once turned into a reviewer holds the Reviewer role for every other submission of the context, so the Create and Enroll paths need a fresh address per submission; the "ORCID iD" box needs `orcid: {enabled: true}` on the context; a second form language is ticked under Settings › Website › Setup › Languages "Forms" (`supportedLocales` belongs under `context` in the create call). The Funding Coordinator path needs a scratch `funding` participant on the submission (`assistant.rita` is assigned to nothing on `publicknowledge`). The default-off control runs on `publicknowledge` (seed-facts: "Reviewer Suggestion at Submission" off) with `author.alex` and `editor.diana`; the preprint-server absence with `author.alex` and `manager.maya` on OPS. Passwords: the username twice; `admin`/`admin`.

<a id="fn-s1"></a>
**s1** — Scenario 1: Rules 1–7 and Fields, on a scratch journal with a throwaway `author` and `editor`; `POST scenarios/submission` with `submitted: false`, opened at `submission?id={id}` as the author. The four "This field is required." messages and the "Please correct 4 errors." summary are note b; the reopen route is My Submissions' "Complete submission"; the Journal Manager's read is Rule 8a. The control runs on `publicknowledge` as `author.alex` (the setting off, seed-facts).

<a id="fn-s2"></a>
**s2** — Scenario 2: Rules 8a–8c, 9 (all three modes) and 11, as the scratch `editor`; `POST scenarios/submission` with `reviewRounds` for round 1 and `reviewerSuggestions[]` holding the throwaway `externalReviewer`'s address, the throwaway `reader`'s address and a fresh address (note s: the Create and Enroll paths need an address no account carries in the context). The mailbox read is Side effects' second bullet. The control is a second `POST scenarios/submission` in review with no `reviewerSuggestions`.

<a id="fn-s3"></a>
**s3** — Scenario 3: Rule 10 (both bullets, the assigned notice) and Rule 11, as the scratch `editor`; `reviewRounds[].reviewers[]` seeds the first `externalReviewer` on round 1 while `reviewerSuggestions[]` carries their address (the seeded assignment leaves the suggestion pending: note h), a second `externalReviewer` for the in-window select, and a fresh address for the inner "Create New Reviewer". The control reuses scenario 2's no-suggestion submission.

<a id="fn-s4"></a>
**s4** — Scenario 4: Actors rows 2 and 4, A1 and A5, as a scratch `funding` participant on the submission (note s); `reviewerSuggestions[]` with the `externalReviewer`'s address and a fresh address. The "Enroll an Existing User as Reviewer" path was not driven for this role (note f-a5).

<a id="fn-s5"></a>
**s5** — Scenario 5 (OMP): Rule 8's press sentence, Rule 10's third bullet, OMP1 and Rule 11, as the scratch `editor`; `POST scenarios/submission` with `reviewRounds` for the internal round and `reviewerSuggestions[]` holding a fresh address and one more; "Send to External Review" is the Review stage's decision wizard (note t10).

<a id="fn-s6"></a>
**s6** — Scenario 6 (OPS): the absence paragraph and note a, on `publicknowledge` as `author.alex` and `manager.maya`; the posted preprint is any seeded one.

<a id="fn-t1"></a>
**t1** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Actors row 1), OJS and OMP: the Journal Manager opened the author's draft with the full wizard, the "Reviewer Suggestions" step and "Add Reviewer Suggestion" included, both by the draft's address and from the Editor Dashboard's "All in submission stage" view ("Incomplete", "Complete submission"); the dashboard has no "Incomplete" view. The section editor, another author, a reviewer and a reader were refused at the address (note a).

<a id="fn-t3"></a>
**t3** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Fields "Email"), OJS and OMP: the second suggestion with the same "Email" was refused with "The email has already been taken." under the box (`validator.unique`) and the panel kept one entry; the same address in capitals saved as a second entry (finding A6).

<a id="fn-t4"></a>
**t4** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 2), OJS and OMP: the empty panel reads "No items found.".

<a id="fn-t5"></a>
**t5** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 3), OJS and OMP: after "Save for Later" and a reopen from My Submissions ("Complete submission" on the Incomplete row) the step listed the same entries; the wizard reopens on the step last shown.

<a id="fn-t6"></a>
**t6** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rules 8a, 8b), OJS and OMP: after three of four suggestions were matched the Submission stage listed all four with no button and nothing marking the matched ones; after "Accept Submission" the Review stage listed the pending row without its "…" menu.

<a id="fn-t7"></a>
**t7** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 8d), OJS and OMP: unticked and saved ("Saved"), no panel on any stage; ticked and saved, the panel back with the same names and the Review stage's "…" menus.

<a id="fn-t8"></a>
**t8** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 9, first mode), OJS and OMP: the window opened on "Selected Reviewer" with the name and email, no "Locate a Reviewer", the "Review Request" message and both dates filled; "Add Reviewer" as is put "{name} / Request Sent" in the Reviewers table, the row left the panel at once, and one request email ("Invitation to review" on OJS, "Manuscript Review Request" on OMP) reached the reviewer.

<a id="fn-t9"></a>
**t9** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 10, second bullet), OJS and OMP, manager and section editor: the inner "Add Reviewer" window opened on "Create New Reviewer" with the four boxes filled for a no-account suggestion and on "Enroll an Existing User as Reviewer" with "{name} ({email})" and the reviewer role preset for the reader's; after its "Add Reviewer" the inner window closed by itself, the outer stayed open, the entry left the list (its row a gap, finding A9), the new reviewer showed under "Locate a Reviewer" with the assigned notice, and the "<" arrow named "Close" closed the outer window onto an already refreshed panel.

<a id="fn-t10"></a>
**t10** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 10, third bullet; OMP1), OMP: the Internal Review stage showed no "Reviewers Suggested by Author" panel; its Reviewers "Add Reviewer" opened with "Submission Author List", "Select a Reviewer from Reviewer Suggestions" and "Locate a Reviewer" in that order; a no-account suggestion added from it read "{name} / Request Sent" on the internal round; after "Send to External Review" the External Review panel and its window's list carried the other suggestions only and the round's Reviewers table read "No Items"; the Submission stage still listed every suggestion.

<a id="fn-t11"></a>
**t11** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 11), OJS and OMP: with "Email" changed to another unused address in "Create New Reviewer" before "Add Reviewer", the new reviewer read "Request Sent" and the suggestion stayed in the panel and in the window's list.

<a id="fn-t12"></a>
**t12** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 12), OJS and OMP: after "Unassign Reviewer" (the row menu offered "Review Details", "Edit", "Unassign Reviewer", "Email Reviewer", "History", "Login As", "Editorial Notes", "Log Response") and after "Cancel Reviewer" on an accepted request, the suggestion returned to neither the Review stage's panel nor the list, while the Submission stage still listed it (note i).

<a id="fn-t13"></a>
**t13** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 10), OJS and OMP: the entry of a reviewer already on the round showed "This reviewer has already been assigned to this review round." and no "Select Reviewer" button; the same person in "Locate a Reviewer" carried the same notice and no button.

<a id="fn-t14"></a>
**t14** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Side effects), OJS and OMP: the Activity Log gained the assignment row and the "An email has been sent: …" row only, no row naming a suggestion; the mailbox held the request (and, for a created account, the "Registration as Reviewer with {journal}" welcome) and nothing else (note k).

<a id="fn-t15"></a>
**t15** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 1), OJS and OMP: Settings › Workflow › Submission has the sub-tab "Author Guidance" whose last box is "For Reviewer Suggestion" with the default text (note c); a custom text saved there ("Saved") showed above the step's panel on the next wizard visit.

<a id="fn-t16"></a>
**t16** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Fields "ORCID iD"; A2), OJS and OMP: with ORCID on the box "ORCID iD" sits after "Email" (order Given Name, Family Name, Email, ORCID iD, Affiliation); `1234` and the bare `0000-0002-1825-0097` were refused with the full-URI message, `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097` saved; the saved iD showed in the author's "Edit" window (its "ORCID iD" box) and nowhere else: not the wizard panel, the Review step, the editors' panel on either stage, the row's Add Reviewer window, or the "Create New Reviewer" form it opened on, which has no ORCID input among its 33 inputs.

<a id="fn-t17"></a>
**t17** — Settled, live-probed 2026-09-06 (Rule 6), OJS and OMP: the block's heading, entry lines, "Edit" target, the empty warning and the completed "Submit" are as note e records.

<a id="fn-f-a1"></a>
**f-a1** — `ReviewerSuggestionManager` is pushed for every editorial-view visitor of the stage and its store fetches the list on mount; `useFetch` then calls `modalStore.openDialogNetworkError()`, which shows the response's error text under the title `common.error` "Error". Live-probed 2026-09-06, OJS and OMP, as a scratch `funding` participant: `GET …/api/v1/submissions/{id}/reviewers/suggestions[?approved=false]` is answered 401 with "The current role does not have access to this operation." (not the 403 `api.403.unauthorized` the middleware `HasRoles` would give) and the dialog shows that text with one "OK"; the same on the Submission stage and Review round 1, with suggestions and without; none on a journal with the setting off; after "OK" the stage was usable and the coordinator went on to open "Add Reviewer".

<a id="fn-f-a5"></a>
**f-a5** — `PKPReviewerGridHandler::__construct()` grants `ROLE_ID_ASSISTANT` the review-round operations minus `createReviewer`, `enrollReviewer` and `gossip` (note a), and `AdvancedSearchReviewerForm::fetch()` adds the "Create New Reviewer" / "Enroll Existing User" link actions only for `ROLE_ID_MANAGER` and `ROLE_ID_SUB_EDITOR`, but `SelectReviewerSuggestionListItem.vue::select()` opens `showReviewerForm` with `selectionType` `REVIEWER_SELECT_CREATE` for any role that reached the window. Live-probed 2026-09-06, OJS (two runs) and OMP (one run): the Funding Coordinator's "Select Reviewer" on a no-account suggestion opened "Create New Reviewer" prefilled; its "Add Reviewer" posted `reviewer-grid/create-reviewer`, answered 200, and the form neither closed nor complained, the Reviewers table still "No Items". The role's "Select Reviewer" on an enrolled reviewer gave the "Selected Reviewer … Change" request form. The Enroll path was not driven for this role.

<a id="fn-f-a2"></a>
**f-a2** — Note t16 (live-probed 2026-09-06: the saved iD in the "Edit" window's box only). `CreateReviewerForm::initData()` copies `familyName`, `givenName`, `email`, `affiliation` only; `ReviewerSuggestionManager.vue`, `SelectReviewerSuggestionListItem.vue`, `ReviewerSuggestionsListPanel.vue` and `review-reviewer-suggestions.tpl` render no `orcidId`; `ReviewerSuggestionsListPanel.vue::openEditModal()` fills the form from `GET …/suggestions/{id}`, which carries it.

<a id="fn-f-a3"></a>
**f-a3** — Notes t12 and i (live-probed 2026-09-06, unassign and cancel, OJS and OMP). The attribute setters keep the first `approved_at` and `reviewer_id`; the grid's unassign and cancel paths never touch the table; the Review stage's panel and the window's list query `withApproved(false)`, the Submission stage's panel queries without the filter and shows the row.

<a id="fn-f-a4"></a>
**f-a4** — Note a: no author workflow config pushes the manager; the API's `getMany` would answer the Author, but no author screen calls it after the wizard. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note e, Rule 7), OJS and OMP: every stage tab of the author's view, with and without suggestions, showed no panel or list.

<a id="fn-f-a6"></a>
**f-a6** — `AddReviewerSuggestion::rules()`'s `Rule::unique` on `reviewer_suggestions` is a plain SQL equality on the stored `email`, case-sensitive on the test installs' Postgres (a MySQL collation may fold case); nothing lower-cases the input. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note b), OJS and OMP: "KAY.…@MAIL.TEST" saved beside "kay.…@mail.test" on the same draft.

<a id="fn-f-a7"></a>
**f-a7** — `lib/pkp/locale/en/default.po`, `default.submission.step.reviewerSuggestions`: "…provide valueable input for the editorial team…", copied into every new context's `reviewerSuggestionsHelp` by `I4787_AddReviewSuggestionHelp`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note c), OJS and OMP, on the step and in the "For Reviewer Suggestion" box.

<a id="fn-f-a8"></a>
**f-a8** — `SelectReviewerSuggestionListItem.vue` renders the button's screen-reader span as `{{ t('common.selectWithName', {name: fullName}) }}`, but the component defines no `fullName` property (the name is `item.fullName`, localized only inside `select()`), so the interpolation yields "undefined"; the reviewer list's `SelectReviewerListItem.vue` passes `item.fullName`. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note h), OJS and OMP: accessible name "Select Reviewer Select undefined" on every suggestion entry, "Select Reviewer Select Rowan Reviewer" in "Locate a Reviewer".

<a id="fn-f-a9"></a>
**f-a9** — `SelectReviewerListPanel.vue::updateReviewerSuggestionList()` marks the item approved and the item's inner `v-if="!item.approvedAt"` hides its content, while the `ListPanel`'s `li` for the item stays rendered. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note h), OJS and OMP: `window.panels[0].items[1].lines: []` after the inner add, the row gone after the window was reopened.

<a id="fn-f-a10"></a>
**f-a10** — The "Back to Search" link is `ReviewerForm::getAdvancedSearchAction()`, an `AjaxAction` on `reloadReviewerForm` with `selectionType` `REVIEWER_SELECT_ADVANCED_SEARCH` that replaces the form's content inside whichever modal holds it; from the inner modal the advanced-search form, suggestions list included, renders inside the inner dialog while the outer one still shows its own, and the grid handlers are bound twice. Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note h), OJS and OMP: three, then four, "Add Reviewer" dialogs stacked; console errors `The handler "$.pkp.controllers.grid.users.reviewer.AdvancedReviewerSearchHandler" has already been bound to the selected element!` and the same for `AddReviewerFormHandler`.

<a id="fn-f-a11"></a>
**f-a11** — `lib/pkp/locale/en/submission.po`, `reviewerSuggestion.suggestionReason.description`, the `FieldRichTextarea('suggestionReason')` description (note b). Live-probed 2026-09-06 (note b; the K4 window snapshots), OJS and OMP, verbatim in the "Add Reviewer Suggestion" and "Edit" windows.

<a id="fn-f-omp1"></a>
**f-omp1** — Note t10 (live-probed 2026-09-06, OMP: both halves hold, the internal add retires the suggestion for the External Review panel and list, that round's Reviewers table "No Items"). Note f (panel absent on `WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID_INTERNAL_REVIEW`; `atActiveReviewStage()` requires stage 3) against note h (`PKPSelectReviewerListPanel` adds the list on any stage); `ReviewerForm::execute()` matches by email whatever the stage (note i).
